To get this equipment, \nhe needs money. Not only does he need \nmoney to outfit himself, but your character \nalso has to cover his living expenses. \nAlthough there are many different types \nof coins and currencies in the world, all \nprices and treasures in the AD&P rules are \ngiven in standard coinage. Your DM may \nhave specific names for different coins and \nmay have different rates of exchange, but \nthis is material particular to his campaign. \nHe will tell you if there are differences from \nthe coins listed here. The standard rate of \nexchange for each coin is given in Table 42. \nThe basic coins are the copper piece (cp) \nand the silver piece (sp). These form the \nbackbone of the monetary system and are \nthe coins most frequently found in the \nhands of the common folk. Above these two \ncoh is the much rarer gold piece (gp). This \ncoin is seldom found in common use and \nmainly exists on paper as the standard \nmoney of account. This means it is used to \nmeasure the value of property and goods. \nLand values, ship cargoes, gemstones, and \npenalty bonds (royal court fines) are nor- \nmally calculated in gold pieces, although \npayment of such vast sums normally takes \nother forms. \nIn addition to these coins, there are other \nunusual metals used in scchange. Most of \nthese come from failed lzurmlcies. As such, \nthey are viewed with skepticism by many \nhonest folk. Principal among these coins are \nthe eiectrum (ep) and platinum pieces (pp). \nThese coins are rarely circulated, and most are \nhidden away in ancient treasure hoards. \nThe value of each coin can also be figured \nby the following: 10 cp =, 1 sp; 5 sp = 1 ep; \n2ep = 1gp;5gp = lpp. \nHowever, remember that not all wealth is \nmeasured by coins. Wealth can take many \nforms-land, livestock, the right to collect \ntaxes or customs, and jewelry are all mea- \nsures of wealth. Coins have no guaranteed \nvalue. A gold piece can buy a lot in a small \nvillage but won’t go very far in a large city. \nThis makes other forms of wealth, land for \ninstance, all the more valuable. Indeed, \nmany a piece of jewelry is actually a way of \ncarrying one’s wealth. Silver armbands can \nbe traded for goods, a golden brooch can \nbuy a cow, etc. In your adventures, wealth \nand riches may take many different forms. \nFurthermore, in your DMs campaign, \nthere may be special situations or consider- \nations to bear in mind. The Kingdom of \nGonfli may be at war with the neighboring \nPrincipality of Boosk. Patriotic Gonflians \nmight refuse Boosk coins (probably because \nthey think the coins are worthless). Practi- \ncal Booskites might accept the Gonfli florin \nat half normal value (so they can melt them \ndown and mint new Boosk drachmas). Of \nTable 42: STANDARD EXCHANGE RATES \nCoin CP \nExchange Value \nSP EP GP r \nPlatinum Piece (PP) = 500 10 5 1 \ncourse, both groups would send your char- \nacter to the local money changer (if there is \none), who would cheerfully convert your \nforeign coins to the local tender. He will, of \ncourse, charge a small commission (10- \n30%) for this service. \nSituations such as these can affect the val- \nue of any coin. If your characters start flash- \ning about a lot of gold, pumping it into the \nlocal economy, merchants will quickly raise \nprices. As another example, the local lord \nmay commandeer most of the region’s \nhorses for his knights, making those left all \nthat much more expensive. \nStarting Money \nAll player charac- \nters begin with some amount of cash. This \nnest egg may be your character’s life sav- \nings. It may be a gift from his parents to \nstart him out in the world. It may be his \nbooty from an army campaign. Perhaps he \nstumbled across a small treasure chest, \nwhetting his appetite for greater and more \ndangerous prizes. How he came by his \nmoney is not important (although it may be \nfun to know). You are free to create any \nexplanation you want. \nTo learn your character’s starting funds, \nroll the dice indicated for his group in Table \n43. This is the number of gold pieces your \ncharacter has to obtain equipment. If you \nare creating a character starting out at a \nlevel above 1st level, check with the DM to \nsee if you can increase your Character‘s \nfunds beyond the amounts given here. \nMulti-class characters use the most \nadvantageous die range of their classes. \nTable 43: INITIAL CHARACTER FUNDS \nCharacter Group Be Range \nWamor 5d4 X 1Ogp \nWizard \nRogue 2d6 X lOgp \nPriest 3d6 X 1Ogp \n* Priest characters can use their money \nonly to purchase equipment and goods. \nOnce all purchases are made, the priest \ncharacter must return all but two or three of \nhis remaining gold pieces to his superiors \n(since his equipment is supplied by his orga- \nnization). Priests cannot lend any of their \ninitial funds to other characters. \n(ld4 +1) X 10 gp \nEquipment Lists \nThe following lists \ninclude much of the equipment your charac- \nter needs for adventuring. The most basic of \nthese are weapons, armor, clothing, and \noutfitting gear. The other lists provide \ngoods and services your character may need \nduring the course of his many adventures. \nWhile most items are always available, your \nDM may add to or delete from these lists. \nWhat you want may not be available or, if \nyour DM has set his game in a specific time \nperiod, may not have been discovered or \ninvented yet! While he should tell you \nwhich items are and aren’t available, you \nshould ask if you have any doubts, particu- \nlarly on large purchases. \nMany of the uncommon items in these \nlists are explained in the following pages. \nThe price given for each item in the lists is \nits average price, the amount you can expect \nthe item to cost in a normal economy. How- \never, large cities, barren wildernesses, and \nplaces with brave adventurers carrying bags \nfull of gold are not normal economies. In \nthese places you may find yourself paying \nmore (very rarely less) than the amount list- \ned. You can also haggle with merchants over \nprices, although to speed up the game it’s \nrecommended that you save this for your \nimportant purchases. If you wind up hag- \ngling over the cost of every tankard of ale, \nyour character is going to spend more time \nbeing a pennypincher than an adventurer1 \nTable 44: EQUIPME” \nClothing \nItem \nBelt \nBoots \nRiding \nsoft \nBreech& \nCap, hat \nCloak \nGood cloth \nFine fur \nGirdle \nGloves \nGown, common \nHose \nKnife sheath \nMittens \nPin \nPlain brooch\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 67 | PDF_PAGE 68]\nEquipment (Lists) \nRobe \nCommon \nEmbroidered \n- \n9 SP \n10 gP \nSandals \nSash \nShoes \nSilk jacket \nSurcoat \nSword scabbard, hanger, baldric \nTabard \nToga, coarse \nTunic \nvest \nDaily Food and Lodging \nItem \nAle (per gallon) \nBanquet (per person) \nBread \nCheese \nCity rooms (per month) \nCommon \nPoor \nCommon wine (pitcher) \nEgg or fresh vegetables \nGrain and stabling for horse \nHoney \nIM lodging (per daylweek) \n(daily) \nCommon \nPoor \nMeat for one meal \nMeals (per day) \nGood \nCommon \nPoor \n(per month) \nSeparate latrine for rooms \nSmall beer (per gallon) \nsoup \nHousehold Provisioning \n: Item \nBarrel of pickled fish \nButter (per Ib.) \nCoarse sugar (per lb.) \nDry rations (per week) \nEggs (per 100) \n(per two dozen) \nFigs (per lb.) \nFirewood (per day) \nHerbs (per lb.) \nNuts (per lb.) \nRaisins (per lb.) \nRice (per lb.) \nSalt (per lb.) \nSalted herring (per 100) \nSpice (per lb.) \nExotic (e.g., saffron, clove) \nRare (e.g., pepper, ginger) \nUncommon (cinnamon) \nTun of cider (250 gal.) \nTun of good wine (250 gal.) \nTack and Harness \nItem cost \nBarding - \nChain 500 gP \nFull plate 2,000 gP \nFull scale 1,000 gP \n500 gP \nmo gP \nmgP \nLeather or padded 150 gp \nBit and bridle 15 sp \nCart hames 2gP \nHalter 5cP \nHorseshoes & shoeing 1 gp Saddle - \nPack 5gP \nRiding 10 gP Saddle bags - \nLarge 4gP \nSmall 3gP \nSaddle blanket 3 SP Yoke - \nHorse 5gP \nox 3gP \nWe (lb.) \n70 \n85 \n75 \n45 \n25 \n50 \n60 \n3 \n10 \n10 \n15 \n35 \n8 \n5 \n4 \n15 \n20 \n- \n- \n- \n- \n* These items weigh little individually. \nTen of these items weigh one pound. \nTransport * \nItem \nBarge \nCanoe \nSmall \nWar \nCaravel \nCarriage \nCommon \nCoach, ornamented \nChariot \nRiding \nWar \nCoaster \ncog \ncurragh \nDrakkar \nDromond \nGalleon \nGreat galley \nKnarr \nLongship \nOar \nCommon \nGalley \nRaft or small keelboat \nSail \nSedan chair \nWagon or cart wheel \n* Movement rates for this equipment are \ngiven in the DMG. \n67 \nMiscellaneous Equipment \nItem \nBackpack \nBarrel, small \nBasket \nLarge \nSmall \nBell \nBelt pouch \nLarge \nSmall \nBlock and tackle \nBolt case \nBucket \nChain (per ft.) \nLight \nLarge \nSmall \nCommon \nFine \nRich \nCandle \nCanvas (per sq. yard). \nChalk \nCrampons \nFishhook \nFishing net, 10 \nft. sq. \nFlint and steel \nGlass bottle \nGrappling hook \nHoly item (symbol, \nwater, etc.) \nHourglass \nIron pot \nLadder, 10 ft. \nLantern \nBeacon \nBullse ye \nHooded \nGood \nPoor \nHeavy \nChest \nCloth (per 10 sq. yds.) \nLock \nMagnifymg glass \nMap or scroll case \nMerchant's scale \nMirror, small metal \nMusical instrument \nOil (per flask) \nGreek fire \nLamp \nPaper (per sheet) \nPapyrus (per sheet) \nParchment (per sheet) \nPerfume (per vial) \nPiton \nQuiver \nRope (per 50 ft.) \nHemp \nSilk \nLarge \nSmall \nSack \nWet Ob) \n2 \n30 \n1 \n- \n* \n- \n- \n1 \nv2 \n5 \n1 \n3 \n3 \n1 \n25 \n10 \n10 \n10 \n10 \n1 \n2 \n5 \n- \n-, \n- \n* \n* \n** \n* \n4 \nn \n1 \n2 \n20 - \n2 \n1 \n1 \nv2 \n1 \nvt-3 \n2 \n1 \n- \n- \n** \n** \n** \nv2 \n1 \n20 \n8 \nv2 \n- \n-\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 68 | PDF_PAGE 69]\nI \nSealing/candle wax \n1 ** \n* \n(per lb.) 1 gP \nSewing needle 5 SP \nSignal whistle 8 SP \npersonal seal 5 gP \nSoap (per lb.) 5 SP 1 \nSpyglass LOO0 gp 1 \nSignet ring or * \nTent - \n20 \n25gp 50 \nLarge \nPavilion 100 gP \nSmall 5gP 10 \nThieves' picks 30 gP 1 \nTorch 1 CP 1 \nWater clock 1,000 gp 200 \nWhetstone 2 CP 1 \nWineskin 8 SP 1 \nWinter blanket 5 SP 3 \nWriting ink (per vial) 8 gp * \n* These items weigh little individually. \nTen of these items weigh one pound. \n** These items have no appreciable \nweight and should not be considered for en- \ncumbrance unless hundreds are carried. \nu \nBOU \nBull \nCalf \nCamel \nCapon \nCat \nChicken \ncow \nDog \nGuard \nWar \nHUnting \nAnimals \nDonkey, mL.-, or ass \nElephant \nLabor \nWar \nFalcon (trained) \nGoat \nGoose \nGuinea hen \nHorse \nDraft \nHeavy war \nLight war \nMedium war \nRiding \nHunting cat (jaguar, etc.) \nox \nPartridge \nPeacock \nPig \nPigeon \nPigeon, homing \nPony \nRam \nSheep \nSongbird \nSwan \nWeapons \nWeight Speed Damage \nItem Cost (Ib.)

This \nis independent of the number of melee \nattacks a character can make in a round. \nRange is given in tens of yards. Each \nrange category (Short, Medium, or Long) \nincludes attacks from distances equal to or \nless than the given range. Thus a heavy \ncrossbow fired at a target 136 yards away \nuses the medium-range modifier. \nThe modifiers for range are - 2 for medi- \num range and - 5 for long range. \nArquebuses (if allowed) double all range \nmodifiers. \nEquipment Descriptions \nNot every piece of \nequipment is described here. The vast \nmajority of things found on the equipment \nlists need no description, as their functions, \nforms, and purposes are obvious. Only \nthose items whose use is obscure or appear- \nance is unusual are described below. Spe- \ncific game effects of equipment are given in \nTack ilnd Humss \nBarding: A war \nhorse, or any animal trained for combat, is \na considerable investment for the average \nwarrior. Therefore it behooves the owner to \nsee that his mount is as well-protected as \npossible. Other than avoiding risks, the best \nnonmagical protection is horse armor or \nbardmg. Barding is simply some type of \narmor fitted to be worn by the mount. Full \nbarding covers the neck, chest, and body of \nthe beast, while half barding covers the \nhead, neck, chest, and front quarters. Bard- \ning can be made from many different mate- \nrials; stouter types provide increasing \nprotection according to the Armor Class of \nthe construction. All of this, however, is at \nthe expense of increased weight and lowered \nmaneuverability of the mount. Plate bard- \ning, for example, is the equivalent of a war- \nrior's field plate and is made of carefully \ninterlocked plates md joints. It provides an \nArmor Class of 2 to the mount. It weighs at \nleast 80 to 100 pounds at the lightest and \nthus a fully equipped war horse with this \narmor can manage littIe more than a steady \ntrot at top speed. \nBarded animals also require special atten- \ntion. Care must be taken to prevent chafing \nand sores. The mount cannot wear the \narmor indefi@ely, It must be removed at \nnight and iddy should not be worn except \nin preparation for a battle or tournament. \nRemoving horse barding takes 15 minutes \nfor leather and 30 minutes for metal armors. \nFitting it on takes twice as long. The weight \nof barding is carefully distributed to \naccount for the weight of the armor and the \nrider, so barded animals cannot be used as \npack animals! It is normal practice to have a \nsecond mount for carrying gear and sup- \nplies. \nWhen barding is fitted over a mount \nwhose natural Armor Class is better than \nthe barding, some protection is still gained. \nThis is explained under Armor on page 76. \nIn addition to horses and elephants, it \nmay be possible to fit barding on more \nfantastic mounts. Flying steeds can wear \nonly leather or magical barding. Aquatic \ncreatures cannot wear normal barding \nalthough extremely rare magical pieces may \nexist. Other land creatures can certainly be \nbarded, provided your DM rules that they \nare sturdy enough to carry the weight of \narmor and rider. Camels, for instance, are \nseldom barded for this reason. A huge \nostrich would not be able to carry barding, \nsince its legs would not support the weight. \nSaddles: There two basic saddles-riding \nand pack. Riding saddles take many forms, \nbut their basic purpose is to carry a person. \nIf your DM has set his campaign in an \nancient or early Medieval setting, saddles \nmay be without stirrups. Ask your DM to \nbe sure. Pack saddles are special frames \ndesigned to carry supplies and equipment. \nThe only practical limit to how much a well- \nstowed pack saddle can carry is the carrying \nability of the animal. \nTransport \nCaravek This ship \nwas sailed in late MedievaUearly Renais- \nsance times and was the type of ship Colum- \nbus used to reach the New World. (It should \nbe used only in late Medieval settings.) It \nnormally has two or three masts and square \nsails. No oars are used. The typical caravel \nis 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The normal \ncrew is from 30 to 40 men. The average car- \ngo displacement is 150-200 tons. \nCoaster: Also called a round ship, this is a \nsmall merchant ship that hugs the coasts. \nThis is a sailing ship, fitted with two masts \nand triangular sails. The average size is 60 to \n70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The rudder \nhangs from one side. The crew is 20 to 30 \nmen, and the cargo capacity is about 100 \ntons. Normally there is only a small stern- \ncastle. A coaster is slow and not tremen- \ndously seaworthy, but it can carry large \namounts of cargo with smaller crews than \ngalleys. \nCog: This ship is a larger, improved ver- \nsion of the coaster, able to make ventures \ninto the open sea. Like the coaster, it is a \nsailing ship with one or two masts, but the \ncog employs square sails. It is abaut 75 to 90 \nfeet long and 20 feet wide. The crew is only \n18 to 20 men, There is normally one deck \nand fore- and sterncastles. The cargo capac- \nities of cogs vary greatly, but the average is \n100 to 200 tons. \nCurrach: This ship is an early, primitive \nvessel. It is made from thick hides stretched \nover a wood-and-wicker frame. A single \nmast carries a small square sail, but the cur- \nragh is usually worked by oars. It is nod \nly 20 to 40 feet long. The crew is approx- \nimately six to eight and the cargo space is \nlimited-no more than five tons. \nDrakkar: The largest of the Viking long- \nships is known as a drakkar or dragonship. \nBuilt for war, this ship stretches about 100 \nfeet in length. Although a single mast can be \nraised, oars provide the main source of \npower. The crew of 60 to 80 men rows, one \nman to an oar. Up to 160 additional men can \nbe carried for boarding and raiding. Due to \nits great size, a drakkar is not very seawor- \nthy. This and the fact that there is no space \non board for many supplies (certainly not \nenough for 240 men) or sleeping quartem \nkeep the drakkar close to the coast where it \ncan put in for the night. Because of its cost \nand limited use, a drakkar is usudly built by \nkings and rulers and is not used for the mun- \ndane task of shipping cargo. \nDromond: This ship is the largest of the \nByzantine galleys. Although it boasts one or \ntwo masts and triangular saib, the main \npower comes from the 100 oars, %to a side. \nThese oars are divided into an upper and \nlower bank, with one man per oar QH the \nlower bank and three men on the upper \nbank. Thus, the total crew is about 200 \nmen. The dromond is about 130 to 175 feet \nlong and 15 feet wide, making it a very den- \nder ship. The cargo capacity is \n100 tons. \nA dromond can be used bth \nand war. As a warship, a ram projects fmm \nthe front just above the water line. Ca&s \nare buiIt fore, aft, and amidships as fir& \nplatforms. The cargo space is then taLLe0 up \nby marines. With such numbers of men, it is \na very dangerous ship to attack. A drd \nis not a seaworthy craft, howevsr, and W- \nally sails in sight of shore. Tkty beach at \nnight like all galleys, since supplies d \ndeeping accommodations are very limited. \nGPlleon: This is the largest and most \nadvanced sailing ship that rnight~k~ah- \nble in the ADLW game. It should appear \nonly in Renaissanceperiod settings. It is a \nsaildriven ship with three or four ma. \nThere are normally three through decks \nhming the length of the ship), while the \ncastles fore and aft have two decks. The \naverage size is about 130 feet long and 30 \nfeet wide. Crews average about 130 mcn. \nAlthough cargo cslpdty is about 9wo tons, \na galkon is mainly used as a warship. (In the \nreal world they were fitted with cannon, \nsomething beyond the stvldard AD&V \ngame rules.) They can easily carry men \nequal to their tonnage, making capture by \npirates nearly impossible. \nGreat Galley Built du- the Lete Mid- \ndle Ages, the great &ley is an improved \nversion of the dromond. It is slightly sd- \n71\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 72 | PDF_PAGE 73]\nrm I i \nEquipment (Descriptions) \nthan the dromond, about 130 feet long and \n20 feet wide. The main power comes from \n140 rowers, one man to an oar but is supple- \nmented by three masts; this combination \ngives it better speed and handling. The car- \ngo capacity is 150 tons. When outfitted as a \nwarship, the front end is built as a ram and \nmarines are carried instead of cargo. Like all \ngalleys, the great galley is a coastal vessel, \nrarely venturing into open water. It is not \nseaworthy in heavy storms and waits in \nport for these to pass. \nKnaa This small ship was a common car- \ngo ship of the Scandinavian region. It is 50 \nto 75 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. It has a \nsingle mast and a square sail. In times of \npoor wind, a few oars at the bow and stem \ncan provide more power. The crew ranges \nfrom eight to 14 men. The cargo capacity is \nsmall, anywhere from ten to 50 tons. The \nship is, however, relatively seaworthy and \ncan be used to make long sea voyages \n(although it cannot be called comfortable). \nIts flat bottom makes it useful for sailing up \nrivers and estuaries, and it can be beached \neasily. \nLongship: This is the standard Viking \nwarship. It is more substantial than the \nknarr but not nearly as massive as the \ndrakkar. An average longship is 75 feet long \nwith 20 to 25 oars per side. Each oar is \nworked by a single man for a total crew of \n40 to 50 men. There is also a single mast and \na square sail. In addition to the crew, the \nship can carry an additional 120 to 150 men. \nA longship can be used for shipping, but its \ncargo capacity is only about 50 tons. It is, \nhowever, fairly seaworthy and can sail \nacross the open sea when necessary. \nMiscellaneous Equipment \nHoly Item: Holy \nitems are small representations of all those \nthings revered by religions-stars, crosses, \nhammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed \nwine, sacred teachings, and more. Just what \nconstitutes a holy item depends on the cam- \npaign your character is in. All good holy \nitems have similar effects on undead and \nother evil creatures, provided they are \nwielded by a follower of a belief associated \nwith these items. Thus, rules that refer to \nholy symbols and holy water apply to all \nsimilar items, provided these items are spe- \ncially prepared by the cleric’s order. \nBecause of their special nature, holy items \ncannot normally be purchased. Different \nsects tend to protect the symbols of their \nfaith to prevent their misuse or corruption. \nTherefore such items must be obtained \nthrough the auspices of a local congrega- \ntion. This is not difficult for sincere fol- \nlowers of that faith, although requests for \nrare or unusual items must always be justi- \nfied. Nonbelievers are given holy items only \nif there is a clear and present danger to the \nfaith. \nLanterns: A hooded lantern (3Gfoot radi- \nus of light) is a standard lantern with shut- \ntered or hinged sides. It is not directional, as \nits light is cast equally in all directions. A \nbullseye lantern (&foot radius of light) has \nonly a single shutter, the other sides being \nhighly polished to reflect the light in a single \ndirection. Both hooded and bullseye lan- \nterns can be carried in one hand. A single \nflask of oil (one pint) bums for six hours in \neither. \nThe beacon lantern (24Gfoot radius of \nlight) is a much larger affair and must be \nmounted on the prow of a ship, the bed of a \nwagon, or other large structure. It operates \nlike the bullseye lantern but illuminates to a \ngreater distance. The beacon goes through \noil quickly, burning a flask every two hours. \nLocks: Locks are still fairly primitive \naffairs (except for those complicated by the \nuse of magic). All are worked with a large \nbulky key. Combination locks are virtually \nunknown at this time. As with most things, \nthere are good, very complex locks as well \nas bad, easily opened locks. \nMagnifying Glass: This simple lens is \nmore an oddity than a useful tool. It does \nnot greatly enhance viewing, especially \nsince many are unevenly ground, creating \ndistortion. It is useful as a substitute for tin- \nder and steel when starting fires. \n72\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 73 | PDF_PAGE 74]\nMerchant's Scale: This is a small balance \nand pans along with a suitable assortment \nof weights. Its main use is to weigh coins- \na common method of settling a transac- \ntion. Merchants are well aware that coins \ncan be undersized, shaved, or plated. The \nonly sound protection is to check the coins \nagainst a set of established weights. It is \nalso needed when using foreign coins to \nmake a purchase or exchange. Of course, \nmerchants are no more noble than anyone \nelse and may use sets of false weights-one \nset heavier than normal for selling an item \n(causing the customer to pay more) and an- \nother set lighter than usual for buying \nitems (letting the merchant pay less). In \nwell-regulated areas, officials verify the ac- \ncuracy of weights and measures, but this in \nitself is no protection. Players may wish to \nhave a scale and weights for their own pro- \ntection. \nOil: Greek fire is a general name given to \nall My flammable oils used in combat. \n(Historically, Greek fire was a special com- \nbination of oil and chemicals that was sticky \nand difficult to extinguish.) These oils are \nhighly flammable and a little dangerous to \ncarry, Lamp oil is used for lamps and lan- \nterns. It is not particularly explosive al- \nthough it can be used to feed an existing \nblaze. \nSpyglass: Like the magnifying glass, the \nspyglass is more of an oddity than a useful \nitem. Objects viewed through it are a little \ncloser, although not much. For better re- \nsults, magical items are preferred. The spy- \nglass gives from two to three times \nmagnification . \nThieved Pkb This is a small collection \nof tools useful to burglars. The kit includes \none or more skeleton keys, long metal \npicks, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand \nsaw, and a small wedge and hammer. These \ncombined with some common tools (such as \na crowbar) make up most of the special \nequipment a thief needs to perform his \ntrade. \nWater Clock This bulky item is good for \ngiving the time accurate to a half-hour. Acti- \nvated by a regulated flow of drops, the wa- \nter clock is not something you carry in your \npocket. For it to work at all, it must have a \nsource of water and be left undisturbed! A \nvery uncommon item, it is primarily an \namusement for the wealthy and a tool for \nthe student of arcane lore. The vast major- \nity of society is not concerned with exact \ntime. \nWeapons \nThe Weapons Table \nlists more than just the price of each item. It \nalso gives other game information. Since \neach weapon is different, you should note \nthis information separately for each weapon \nvour character purchases or finds. \nWeapon Size All weapons are classed ac- \ncording to a size category-S, M, L, G, or \nH. Small (S) weapons are approximately \ntwo feet or less in size; medium (M) weap- \nons are two to five feet long; large (L) weap- \nons are generally six feet or greater in \nlength. Giant (G) and huge (H) weapons are \nnot found on the lists, since these are items \nnormally used by ogres, giants, and even \ngreater creatures. They are not items of \nequipment a PC can normally buy! \nA character can always wield a weapon \nequal to his own size or less. Normally this \nrequires only one hand, except for some \nmissile weapons (bows and crossbows in \nparticular). A character can also use a \nweapon one size greater than himself al- \nthough it must be gripped with two hands. \nBeyond this size limit, the weapon is not us- \nable without special means (most often \nmagical). \nDrelb the halfling (size S) can use a short \nsword with no difficulty (a size S weapon), \nor a long sword with two hands (a size M \nweapon), but a glaive (size L) is just too \nlarge for him to wield. Likewise, he can use \na short bow but is unable to handle a long \nbow. \nType: Weapons are classified according to \ntypes-bludgeoning (B), piercing (P), and \nslashing (S). These types are used to deter- \nmine armor type modifiers (if these are \nused). Weapons vs. Armor Type is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat (page 89). \nSpeed Factor: Weapon speed is a relative \nmeasure of the clumsiness of the weapon. \nThe lower the number, the quicker and eas- \nier the weapon is to use. Weapon speed is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat. \nDamage: All weapons are rated for the \namount of damage they can cause to small- \nand medium-sized creatures (S-M) and \nlarger-than-man-sized creatures (L). \nArquebus: This weapon may be disal- \nlowed by your DM and you must check \nwith him before you purchase it. An arque- \nbus is an early form of the musket, almost \nas dangerous to its user as it is to the target. \nTo use an arquebus, you must have a sup- \nply of powder and shot and a piece of slow- \nburning match or cord. These items may or \nmay not be commonly available. (Powder \nis treated as a magical item in these rules.) \nThe weapon can be fired only once every \nthree rounds, and then only if the character \nis not attacked while loading. When firing \nan arquebus, all penalties for range are \ndoubled. \nIf the attack roll for the arquebus is a 1 or \n2, the weapon backfires, causing ld6 points \nof damage to the firer. It is also fouled and \ncannot be used again until it has been \ncleaned, which takes about 30 minutes. \nWhen a arquebus scores a hit, it normally \ndoes 1 to 9 points of damage on ld10. When \na 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and this \n73 \namount is added to 10. Each time a 10 is \nrolled, the die is rolled again and ded to \nthe previous total. Thus, in a rare indance, \na single shot could inflict 37 points, for ex- \nample, if three consecutive 10s were rolled, \nfollowed by a 7. The damage caused by an \narquebus is never modified for a high \nStrength score. \nBows: Bows come in various shapes and \nsizes. The power of a bow is measured by its \npull. The greater the pull, the more Strength \nneeded to work the bow. Thus it is possible \nhas a greater pull \nwith low Strengths \nties when using a bo \nweaker bows or sim \nbow-the bow of a strong hero may simply \nbe unstringable by a lesser man (as was \nodysseus's) . \ncharacters must roll a successful bend bars/ \nlift gates roll to string or use such weapans \n(again, think of the test uf the suitors in \nOdysseus's houkhold) . \nArrows for long bows of all types are di- \nvided between light-weight flight arrows \nCrossbow: Strength bonuses or penalties \ndo not apply to crossbows, since these are \npurely mechanical devices. The hand cmss- \ntype of horse or a greater one. A man on a \nlight war horse could not use a heavy home \nlance, if only because the impact would\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 74 | PDF_PAGE 75]\nI) Equipment (Descriptions) \nbowl him and the horse right over! Further- \nmore, the heavy and jousting lances require \nthat the rider is firmly in a saddle and using \nstirrups. The jousting lance is a heavy horse \nlance modified for use in tournaments, in \nwhich the desire is not to kill the opponent. \nThe end of the lance is fitted with a special \nblunted tip intended to lessen the chance of \nwounds. Of course, good intentions often \ngo awry, so there is still a chance of injury \nduring a joust. \nMancatcher: This item is a highly special- \nized type of polearm designed to capture \nwithout killing a victim. It consists of a long \npole with a spring-loaded set of sharpened \njaws at the end. The victim is caught \nbetween the arms, which then snap shut. \nThe mancatcher is effective only on man- \nsized matures. The target is always treated \nas AC 10, modified for Dexterity. If a hit is \nscored, the character is caught. The caught \nvictim loses all shield and Dexterity bonuses \nand can be pushed and pulled about. This \ncauses an automatic Id2 points of damage \nper round and gives a 25% chance of pulling \nthe victim to the ground. The victim can \nescape on a successful bend barsllift gates \nroll, although this results in ld2 points more \ndamage. A common tactic is to use the \nweapon to pull horsemen off their mounts, \nthen pin them to the ground. \nPolearms: A popular group of weapons \nduring the ancient and Medieval periods \nwere the polearms. Their length was a dis- \ntinct advantage and, for the peasant, they \nwere a relatively easy weapon to make. \nThus there came to be an abundance of \npolearms of different sizes and shapes. Due \nto their numbers, there is no standard sys- \ntem for naming polearms. The names used \nin the AD%P game might possibly be \napplied to other weapons elsewhere. \nBecause of their length, all polearms are \ninfantry weapons and require two hands to \nuse. They are almost always the weapon of \nthe common peasant and soldier, who, lack- \ning a horse and heavy armor, needs some \nweapon to keep the enemy's knights at bay. \nThus most polearms are intended to be used \nin close-packed formations that present a \nforest of sharp points and wicked blades to \nany knight foolish enough to charge. \nAwl Pike: Essentially this is a long spear \n12 to 20 feet long ending in a spike point of \ntapered spear head. It was a popular weap- \non during the Renaissance. Since the pike \nstuck out in front, men could be packed \nside-by-side in dense formations, and sev- \neral rows of men could fight. Large blocks \nof pikemen made formidable troops. How- \never, once the pikemen engaged in close \ncombat, they normally dropped their clum- \nsy awl pikes and fought hand-to-hand with \nshort swords. \nBardiche: One of the simplest of \npolearms, the bardiche is an elongated bat- \ntle axe. A large curving axe-head is mounted \non the end of a five- to eight-foot-long shaft. \nIt probably grew out of common peasant \ntools and was popular with them. One rela- \ntive disadvantage is that the bardiche \nrequired more space to wield than a pike or \na spear. \nBec de corbin: This was a highly special- \nized weapon of the upper classes during the \nLate Middle Ages and the early Renais- \nsance. It is an early can-opener designed \nspecifically to deal with plate armor. The \npick or beak is made to punch through \nplate, while the hammer side can be used to \ngive a stiff blow. The end is fitted with a \nshort blade for dealing with unarmored or \nhelpless foes. The weapon is about eight feet \nlong. Since the weapon relies on impact, a \ngreat deal of swinging space is needed. \nBill-guisarme: A particularly bizarre- \nlooking combination weapon, the bill- \nguisarme is an outgrowth of the common \nbill hook. Mounted on a seven- to eight- \nfoot-long pole, it has a combination of a \nheavy, cleaver blade, a jutting back spike, \nand a hook or spike on the end. Thus, it can \nbe used in several different ways. Like most \npolearms, it requires lots of room to use. \nFauchard: An outgrowth of the sickle and \nscythe, the fauchard is a long, inward curv- \ning blade mounted on a shaft six to eight feet \nlong. It can slash or thrust, although the \ninward curving point makes thrusting rath- \ner ineffective. Its advantage is that a peasant \ncan easily convert his common scythe into \nthis weapon of war. \nFauchard-fork: This is an attempted \nimprovement on the fauchard, adding a \nlong spike or fork to the back of the blade. \nSupposedly this improves the thrusting abil- \nity of the weapon. It is still an inefficient \nweapon. \nGlaive: One of the most basic polearms, \nthe glaive is a single-edged blade mounted \non a eight- to ten-foot-long shaft. While not \nthe most efficient weapon, it is relatively \neasy to make and use. Normally the blade \nturns outward to increase the cutting area \nuntil it almost resembles a cleaver or axe. \nGlaive-guisarme: Another combination \nweapon, this one takes the basic glaive and \nadds a spike or hook to the back of the \nblade. In theory, this increases the useful- \nness of the weapon although its actual appli- \ncation is somewhat questionable. \nGuisarme: Thought to have derived from \na pruning hook, this is an elaborately \ncurved heavy blade. While convenient and \nhandy, it is not very effective. \nGuisarme-voulge: This weapon has a \nmodified axe blade mounted on an eight- \nfoot-long shaft. The end of the blade tapers \nto a point for thrusting and a back spike is \nfitted for punching through armor. Some- \ntimes this spike is replaced by a sharpened \nhook for dismounting riders. \nHalberd: After the awl pike and the bill, \nthis was one of the most popular weapons of \nthe Middle Ages, Fixed on a shaft five to \neight feet long is a large axe blade, angled \nfor maximum impact. The end of the blade \ntapers to a long spear point or awl pike. On \nthe back is a hook for attacking armor or \ndismounting riders. Originally intended to \ndefeat cavalry, it is not tremendously suc- \ncessful in that role since it lacks the reach of \nthe pike and needs considerable room to \nswing. It found new life against blocks of \npikemen. Should the advance of the main \nattack stall, halberdiers issue out of the for- \nmation and attack the flanks of the enemy. \nThe pikemen with their overlong weapons \nare nearly defenseless in such close combat. \nHook fauchard: This combination weap- \non is another attempted improvement to \nfauchard. A back hook is fitted to the b \nof the blade, supposedly to dismount ho \nmen. Like the fauchard, this is not a tre \ndously successful weapon. \nthe bec de corbin. Fitted with a shaft u \nten feet long, it is usually fou \nof the common soldier. Like \nbin, its main purpose is to \narmor. The end is fitted wit \nof an awl pike to hold off e \nLucern hammer: This weapon is similar t \nlittle more than a pitchfork fixed to a longe \nshaft. With tines strengthened and strai \nened, the military fork serves well. Th \nfor cutting and cleaving eventually \nresults in combining the fork with \nweapons. \nPartisan: Shorter than the awl pike b \nlonger than the spear, the partisan is a broa \nspear-head mounted on an eight-foot-1 \nshaft. Two smaller blades project out f \nthe base of the main blade, just to incr \ndamage and trap weapons. Since it is \nthrusting weapon, it can be used in close1 \npacked formations. \nRanseur: Very much like the partisan \nranseur differs in that the main blade is t \nner and the projecting blades extended m \nlike tines of a fork. These can trap a weapo \nopponent. \nVodge: The voulge, like the bardiche, is a \nvariation on the axe and the cleaver. The \nvoulge is little more than a cleaver on the \nend of a long (seven- to eight-foot) pole. It is \na popular weapon, easy to make and simple \nto learn. It is also called the Lochaber axe. \nScourge: This wicked weapon is a short \nwhip with several thongs or tails. Each \nthong is studded with metal barbs, resulting \n74\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 75 | PDF_PAGE 76]\nI Equipment (Descriptions) \nI \nin a terrible lash. It is sometimes used as an \ninstrument of execution. \nSword, Bastard This sword is similar to a \nlong sword in size and weight, but has a \nlonger hilt. It can be used one- or two- \nhanded. Use the speed factor and damage \nappropriate to the grip. If it is used two- \nhanded, your character cannot employ a \nshield. \nSword, Khopesh: This is an Egyptian \nweapon. A khopesh has about six inches of \nhandle and quillons. Its blade is then \nstraight from the quillons for about two \nfeet. The blade becomes sickle-shaped at \nthis point, being about two additional feet \nlong but effectively extending the overall \nlength of the sword by only 1% feet. This \nmakes the khopesh both heavy and \nunwieldy, difficult to employ properly, and \nslow to recover, particularly after a badly \nmissed blow. Its sickle-like portion can snag \nan opponent or an opposing weapon. \nArmor \nYou are going to \nwant your player character to buy armor, if \nhe is allowed to use any. Armor is the easiest \nand cheapest way to improve your charac- \nter’s chance of surviving the more violent \ndangers of the adventuring life. Clearly, the \nbetter the armor the character possesses, the \nless likely he is to be hurt. Armor protection \nis measured by Armor Class (AC), a number \nraw the lower the Armor Class number, \nthe better the protection. Table 46 lists the \nvalues for all the types of armor found in the \ntquipment lists. \nrabk 46: ARMOR CLASS RATINGS \nAC \nNone 10 \nShield only 9 \nLeather or padded armor 8 \nLeather or padded armor + shield, \nstudded leather, or ring mail armor 7 \nStudded leather or ring mail + shield, \nbrigandine, scale mail, \nor hide armor 6 \n5 \nType of Armor \nScale mail or hide + shield, chain mail \nChain mail + shield, splint mail, \nSplint mail, banded mail, or bronze \n. banded mail, bronze plate mail 4 \n3 \nPlate mail + shield, field plate 2 \n1 \nFull plate armor + shield 0 \nNote: See this page for more information \non the defensive benefits of various shields. \nAlthough there is some controversy his- \ntorically over the different types of armor, \nall known or suspected types are included \nhere. However, not all armor may be availa- \nplate mail + shield, plate mail \nField plate armor + shield, full plate \nble if your DM has chosen to set his cam- \npaign in a particular historical era or locale. \nFor example, full plate armor is not availa- \nble to characters adventuring in an ancient \nGreek setting. \nBanded: This armor is made of overlap- \nping strips of metal sewn to a backing of \nleather and chain mail. Generally the strips \ncover only the more vulnerable areas, while \nthe chain and leather protect the joints \nwhere freedom of movement must be \nensured. Through straps and buckles, the \nweight is more or less evenly distributed. \nBdgandine: This armor is made from \nsmall metal plates sewn or riveted to a layer \nof canvas or leather and protected by an \nouter layer of cloth. It is rather stiff and does \nnot provide adequate protection to the \njoints where the metal plates must be spaced \nwidely or left off. \nBronze plate mail: This is a plate mail \narmor-a combination of metal plates, \nchain mail or brigandine, leather and \npadding-made of softer bronze. It is easier \nand cheaper to make than steel armor, but it \ndoes not protect as well. A large breastplate \nand other metal plates cover areas of the \nbody, but the other materials must protect \nthe joints and movable parts of the body. It \nis not the full plate armor of the heavy \nknight of the Late Middle Ages and the Ren- \naissance. \nChain mail: This armor is made of inter- \nlocking metal rings. It is always worn with a \nlayer of quilted fabric padding underneath \nto prevent painful chafing and to cushion \nthe impact of blows. Several layers of mail \nare normally hung over vital areas. The \nlinks yield easily to blows, absorbing some \nof the shock. Most of the weight of this \narmor is camed on the shoulders and it is \nuncomfortable to wear for long periods of \ntime. \nField plate armor: This is the most com- \nmon version of full plate armor, consisting \nof shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and \ninterlocked to cover the entire body. It \nincludes gauntlets, boots, and a visored hel- \nmet. A thick layer of padding must be worn \nunderneath. However, the weight of the suit \nis well-distributed over the whole body. \nSuch Tor hampers movement only slight- \nly. Aside from its expense, the main disad- \nvantages are the lack of ventilation and the \ntime required to put it on and take it off (see \nthe “Getting Into and Out of Armor” sec- \ntion). Each suit of field plate must be indi- \nvidually fitted to its owner by a master \narmorer, although captured pieces can be \nresized to fit the new owner (unless such is \npatently absurd, such as a human trying to \nresize a halfling’s armor). \nFdl Plate This is the impressive, high \nGothic-style armor of the Late Middle Ages \nand Renaissance. It is perfectly forged and \nfitted. All the plates are interlocking and \ncarefully angled to deflect blows. The sur- \n75 \nfaces are normally highly ornamented with \netching and inlaid metals. Each suit must be \ncarefully custom-fitted to the owner and \nthere is only a 20% chance that a captured \nsuit can be refitted to a new owner of \napproximately the same size. The metal \nplates are backed by padding and chain \nmail. The weight is well-dishibuted. The \narmor is hot, slow to don, and extremely \nexpensive. Due to these factors, it tends to \nbe used more for parades and triumphs than \nactual combat. \nHide: This is armor prepd from the \nextremely thick hide of a creature (such as \nan elephant) or from multiple layers of regu- \nlar leather. It is stiff and hard to move in. \nLeather: This armor is made of leather \nhardened in boiling oil and then shaped into \nbreastplate and shoulder protectors. The \nremainder of the suit is fashioned from more \nflexible, somewhat softer materials. \nPadded: This is the simplest type of \narmor, fashioned from quilted layers of \ncloth and batting. It tends to get hot and \nafter a time becomes foul with sweat, grime, \nlice, and fleas. \nPlate mail: This armor is a combination \nof chain or brigandine with metal plates \n(curiass, epaulettes, elbow guards, gaunt- \nlets, tassets, and greaves) covering vital \nareas. The weight is distributed over the \nwhole body and the whole thing is held \ntogether by buckles and straps. This is the \nmost common form of heavy armor. \nRing mail: This armor is an early (and less \neffective) form of chain mail in which metal \nrings are sewn directly to a leather backing \ninstead of being interlaced. (Historians still \ndebate whether this armor ever existed.) \nScale mail: This is a coat and legghgs \n(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather \ncovered with overlapping pieces of metal, \nmuch like the scales of a fish. \nShielda All shields improve a character‘s \nArmor Class by 1 or more against a speci- \nfied number of attacks. A shield is useful \nonly to protect the front and flanks of the \nuser. Attacks from the rear or rear flanks \ncannot be blocked by a shield (exception: a \nshield slung across the back does help \ndefend against rear attacks). The reference \nto the size of the shield is relative to the size \nof the character. Thus a human’s small \nshield would have all the effects of a medi- \num shield when used by a gnome. \nA buckler (or target) is a very small shield \nthat fastens on the forearm. It can be worn \nby crossbowmen and archers with no hin- \ndrance. Its small size enables it to protect \nagainst only one attack per melee round (of \nthe user’s choice), improving the character‘s \nArmor Class by 1 against that attack. \nA small shield is carried on the foream \nand gripped with the hand. Its light weight \npermits the user to carry other items in that \nhand (although he cannot use weapons). It \ncan be used to protect against two frontal\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 76 | PDF_PAGE 77]\nEquipment (Encumbrance) \nattacks of the user's choice. \nThe medium shield is carried in the same \nmanner as the small shield. Its weight pre- \nvents the character from using his shield \nhand for other purposes. With a medium \nshield, a character can protect against any \nfrontal or flank attacks. \nThe body shield is a massive shield reach- \ning nearly from chin to toe. It must be firmly \nfastened to the forearm and the shield hand \nmust grip it at all times. It provides a great \ndeal of protection, improving the Armor \nClass of the character by 1 against melee \nattacks and by 2 against missile attacks, for \nattacks from the front or front flank sides. It \nis very heavy; the DM may wish to use the \noptional encumbrance system if he allows \nthis shield. \nSplint Mail: The existence of this armor \nhas been questioned. It is claimed that the \narmor is made of narrow vertical strips riv- \neted to a backing of leather and cloth pad- \nding. Since this is not flexible, the joints are \nprotected by chain mail. \nStudded leather: This armor is made \nfrom leather (not hardened as with normal \nleather armor) reinforced with close-set \nmetal rivets. In some ways it is very similar \nto brigandine, although the spacing \nbetween each metal piece is greater. \nIn addition to the types of armor listed \nabove, your DM may have special armors \nprepared from rare or exotic materials. \nSince it is highly unlikely that your charac- \nter can afford these at the start, the DM will \ntell you when you need to know about such \nitems. \nArmor Sizes \nThe equipment list reflects the price of a \nsuit of armor (including an appropriate hel- \nmet) made for any normal player character \nrace. Although a halfling is much smaller \nthan a human and needs a smaller suit, there \nare fewer armorers available to meet such \nspecialized needs. Thus the armor for a half- \nling is as expensive as that for a human. \nArmdr for nonstandard sizes and shapes is \ngoing to cost significantly more and must be \ncustom-made. This is not the kind of thing \none can pick up at the local storef \nWhen armor is found during the course of \nan adventure, the players should note the \ncreature who wore the armor previously. \nWhile a human-sized character might be \nable to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do \nlittle good for a halfling. Likewise, the \narmor of a giant is of little use to anyone. \nArmor size also affects the weight of the \narmor, if the optional encumbrance system \nis used. The weights listed on the table are \nfor human-sized (Medium) armors. Small \narmor weighs half the amount listed, while \nlarge armor weighs 50% more. \nGetting Into and Out of Armor \nThere are times when it is important to \nknow how quickly a character can get into \nor out of his armor. Accidents and unfore- \nseen events happen all the time. The party is \nattacked at night. Those sleeping around the \ncampfire may want to don their armor \nbefore rushing into battle. A character slips \nand falls into the river where his heavy \narmor pulls him down like a stone. He \ngreatly desires to get it off before he drowns. \nJust how long does it take him? \nThe time required to don armor depends \non its make. Those armors that are a single \npiece-leather tunics, robes, chain mail- \ntake one round (two for metal items) to don \nwith slight assistance. Without aid, the time \nis doubled. Armor that is made of separate \npieces requires ld6 + 4 rounds, again with \nassistance. Without help, the time required \nis tripled. In all cases, the times given \nassume that the proper undergarments and \npadding are also worn. \nSometimes characters need to get into \narmor in a hurry and thus they dress hastily. \nThis assumes that some buckles aren't fas- \ntened, seatings adjusted, etc. Single suits \ncan be hastily donned in one round at the \ncost of 1 worse AC (though never worse \nthan 8). Thus, a fighter could hastily pull on \nhis brigandine jack (AC 6) and charge into a \nfray with an AC of 7. Hastily donning piece \narmor (plate mail for example) improves the \ncharacter's AC by 1 (from a base of 10) for \nevery round spent dressing. A fighter could \nchoose to spend three rounds fitting on \nparts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of \n7, before going into battle. \nRemoving armor is a much quicker matter. \nMost can be shed in a single round. Piece \narmor (particularly full plate) requires ld4 + \n1 raunds. However, if the character is willing \nto cut straps and bend pins, such armors can \nbe removed in half the time (roll ld4+1, \ndivide by 2, then round fractions up). \nCreatures with Natural Armor Classes \nSome creatures possess a natural Armor \nClass already superior to some of the armor \ntypes (for example, the horse is AC 7). \nHowever, these creatures can still benefit \nfrom wearing armor of a quality worse than \ntheir natural Armor Class.
