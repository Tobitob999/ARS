A player character could be- \ncome proficient with a long bow or a short \nbow, but not with all bows in general (unless \nhe devotes a proficiency slot to each individ- \nually). Furthermore, a character can assign \nweapon proficiency slots only to those weap- \nons allowed to his character class. \nAs a character reaches higher experience \nlevels, he also earns additional weapon pro- \nficiencies. The rate at which proficiencies \nare gained depends on the character's class. \nWarriors, who concentrate on their martial \nskills, learn to handle a great number of \nweapons. They gain weapon proficiencies \nquickly. Wizards, who spend their time \nstudying forgotten magical acts, have little \ntime to practice with weapons. They gain \nadditional weapon proficiencies very \nslowly. Multi-class characters can use the \nmost beneficial line on Table 34 to determine \ntheir initial proficiencies and when they gain \nnew proficiencies. \nEffects of Weapon hoficlencin \nA character who \nhas a specific weapon proficiency is skilled \nwith that weapon and familiar with its use. \nA character does not gain any bonuses for \nusing a weapon he is proficient with; the \ncombat rules and attack chances assume \nthat everyone uses a weapon he is proficient \nwith. This eliminates the need to add a mod- \nifier to every die roll during battle. \nWhen a character uses a weapon that he is \nnot proficient with, however, he suffers a \npenalty on his chance to hit. The size of this \npenalty depends on the character's class. \nWarriors have the smallest penalty because \nthey are assumed to have passing familiarity \nwith all weapons. Wizards, by comparison, \nare heavily penalized because of their lim- \nited study of weapons. The modifiers for \neach class (which are taken as penalties to \nthe'attack die roll) are listed on Table 34. \nRelated Weapons Bonus \nWhen a character \ngains a weapon proficiency, he is learning to \nuse a particular weapon effectively. How- \never, many weapons have similar character- \nistics. A long sword, bastard sword, and \nbroad sword, while all different, are all \nheavy, slashing swords. A character who is \ntrained with one can apply some of his skill \nto the others. He is not fully proficieot with \nthe weapon, but he knows more about it \nthan someone who picks it up without any \nskill in similar weapons. \nWhen a character uses a weapon that is \nsimilar to a weapon he is proficient with, his \nattack penalty is only one-half the normal \namount (rounded up). A warrior, for exam- \nple, would have a. - 1 penalty with a related \nweapon instead of -2. A wizard would \nhave a -3 penalty instead of -5. \nSpecific decisions about which weapons \nare related are left to the DM. Some likely \ncategories are: \nhand axe, battle axe; \nshort bow, long bow, composite bow; \nheavy and light crossbows- \ndagger, knife; \nglaive, halberd, bardiche, voulge, \nguisarme, glaive-guisarme, guisarme- \nvoulge; \nharpoon, spear, trident, javelin; \nfootman's mace, horseman's mace, morn- \ning star, flail, hammer, club; \nmilitary fork, ranseur, spetum, partisan; \nscimitar, bastard sword, long sword, \nbroad sword; \nsling, staff sling \nWeapon Speclrllutlon \nKnowing how to \nuse a weapon without embarrassing your- \nself is very different from being a master of \nthat weapon. There are warriors, and then \nthere are martial artists. An Olympic fencer \nis more than just an athlete; he can do things \nwith his weapon that astound most fencers. \nIn the AD&W game, part of your charac- \nter's skill is reflected in the bonuses he.earns \nas he reaches higher levels. As your charac- \nter advances, he becomes a wiser, more dan- \ngerous fighter. Experience has taught him to \nanticipate his opponents and to pounce on \nany advantage that presents itself. But this \nis a general, overall improvement, brought \nabout by the warrior's sharpening senses \nand timing. It applies equally to all types of \nfighting. \nWeapon specialization is an optional rule \nthat enables a fighter (only) to choose a sin- \ngle weapon and specialize in its use. Any \nweapon may be chosen. Specialization is \nnormally announced (and paid for with \nweapon proficiency slots) when the charac- \nter is created. But even after a player charac- \nter earns experience, he can still choose to \nspecialize in a weapon, provided he \n52 \nhas the weapon proficiency slots available. \nIn one way, a weapon specialist is like a \nwizard specialist. The specialization re- \nquires a single-minded dedication and train- \ning. Thus multi-class characters cannot use \nweapon specialization; it is available only to \nsingle-class fighters. \nCost of Specialization \nWeapon specialization is obtained by de- \nvoting extra weapon proficiency slots to the \nchosen weapon. To specialize in any sort of \nmelee weapon or crossbow, the character \nmust devote two slots-one slot to become \nproficient with it, and then a second slot to \nspecialize in it. Any bow (other than a cross- \nbow) requires a total of three proficiency \nslots: one for proficiency and two to spe- \ncialize. Assume, for the moment, that Rath \nthe dwarf decided to speciaIize with the \nwarhammer. Two of his four proficiency \nslots are thus devoted to the warhammer. \nWith the two remaining, he can become \nproficient with the short sword and short \nbow (for example). \nEffects of Specialization \nWhen a character specializes with a melee \nweapon, he gains a +1 bonus to all his at- \ntack rolls with that weapon and a +2 bonus \nto all damage rolls (in addition to bonuses \nfor Strength and magic). The attack bonuses \nare not magical and do not enable the char- \nacter to affect a creature that can be injured \nonry by magical weapons. \nBow and crossbow specialists gain an ad- \nditional range category: point blank. \nPoint-blank range for bows is from six feet \nto 30 feet. Point-blank range for crossbows \nis from six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank \nrange, the character gains a +2 modifier on \nattack rolls. No additional damage is \ncaused, but Strength (for bows) and magical \nbonuses apply. Furthermore, if the charac- \nter has an arrow nocked and drawn, or a \nbolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in \nsight, he can fire at the beginning of the. \nround before any initiative rolls are made. \nFighters who specialize also gain extra at- \ntacks earlier than those who don't specid- \nize. Bonus attacks for specialists are listed \non Table 35. The use of this table is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat. Bow special- \nists do not gain any additional attacks per \nround. \nNonweapon Proficiencies \nA player character \nis more than a collection of combat modi- \nfiers. Most people have a variety of skills \nlearned over the years. Consider yourself as \nan example-how many skills do you pos- \nsess? If you have gone through 12 years of \nschool, were moderately active in after- \nschool programs, and did fairly well on \nyour grades, the following might be a par- \n*. \nI\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 53 | PDF_PAGE 54]\ntial list of your skills: \nEnglish reading and writing \nGeometry, algebra, and trigonometry \nBasic chemistry \nBasic Dhvsics a. \nMusic (playing an instrument, singing, or \nboth) \nSpanish reading and writing (or French, \nBasic Shop or Home Economics \nTyping \nDriving \nHistory \nBasic biology \nIn addition to the things learned i \nschool, you have also learned things fror \nyour parents, friends, scouts, or othe \ngroups. You might be able to add any of th \nfollowing to your list. \nGerman, etc.) \n- \nSwimmimz \nI \nHunting \nFishing \n, Sailing \nCanoeing \n' Horseback riding \nFirst aid \nAnimal training \ncooking \nSewing \nEmbroidery \nDancing \nIf you consider all your hobbies and all \nthe things you have done, you probably \nknow many more skills. In fact, if you make \na list, you probably will be surprised by the \nlarge number of basic skills you have. And, \nat this point, you are (or were) still young1 \nNow, having graduated from school, you \nget a job. Are you just a carpenter, mechan- \nic, electrician, salesman, or secretary? Of \ncoursenot; you are a lot more than just your \njob. All those things you learned in school \nand elsewhere are part of what you are. \nShouldn't it be the same for your player \ncharacter? \nFor a really complete role-playing charac- \nter, you should know what your character \ncan do. There are three different ways to do \nthis: using what you know, using second- \nary skills, and using nonweapon proficien- \ncies. Each of these is optional, but,each \ninaeases the amount of detail that rounds \nout your character. \nUsing What You Know \nIf your DM decides \nnot to use secondary skills or nonweapon \nproficiencies, situations will arise in which \nyou'll have to determine whether your char- \nacter has certain skills. For example, \nDelsenora the mage slips at the edge of a \nsteep riverbank and tumbles into the water. \nThe current sweeps her into the middle of \nthe river. To escape, she must swim to \nsafety. But does Delsenora know how t \nswim? \nOne way to answer this is to pretend tha \nyour character knows most of the thing \nthat you know. Do you know how to swim \nIf you do, then your character can swim. 1 \nyou know a little about mountain climbing \nhorseback riding, carpentry, or sewing \nyour character knows these things, too \nThis also applies to things your characte \nmight want to build. Perhaps your charac \nter decides he wants to build a catapult. I \nyou can show your DM how to make such i \ndevice, then the DM may allow your char. \nacter the same knowledge. Indeed, yor \nmight visit the local library just to gain this \ninformation. \nThere are real advantages to this method. \nYou can learn something at the library 01 \nschool and bring it into your game. Also, \nthere are fewer rules to get in the way of \nyour fun. Since there are fewer rules, your \nDM has a lot of flexibility and can play out \nall the drama inherent in a scene. \nThere,are also problems with this meth- \nod. First, you probably know a lot of things \nyour character should not-basic electron- \nics, the components of gunpowder, or calcu- \nlus, for instance. You have a lot of \nknowledge that is just not available to \nsomeone in a medieval world (even a fanta- \nsy medieval world). Likewise, there are \nthings that a typical person in a medieval \nworld would know that you, as a modem \nperson, have never needed to learn. Do you \nknow how to make armor? Skin a deer? Salt \nmeat away for the winter? Turn flax into lin- \nm? Thatch a roof? Read heraldry? You \nnight, but there is no way you can consider \n:hese common skills anymore. But in a \nnedieval world they would be common. \nAlso, knowing something about a skill or \nrade doesn't mean you know a lot, and \nhere is a big difference between the two. \n&en Delsenora fell into the raging river, \nhe had to swim out. But was she a strong \nnough swimmer to pull free of the current? \n'he DM must make up a rule on the spot to \niandle the situation. Perhaps you can swim, \nvt can you swim well enough to escape a \naging torrent? \nThe biggest drawback to this method is \n?at there are no rules to resolve tricky situ- \ntions. The DM must make it up during \nlay. Some players and DMs enjoy doing \nus. They think up good answers quickly. \nlany consider this to be a large part of the \nin. This method is perfect for them, and \nley should use it. \nOther players and DMs like to have clear \ndes to prevent arguments. If this is the case \nI your group, it is better to use secondary \n  ills or nonweapon proficiencies. \n53 \nRoll \n01-02 \n03-04 \n05-10 \n11-14 \n15-20 \n21-23 \n14-27 \nB-32 \n53-34 \n15-57 \n18-39 \n,042 \n3-44 \n5-46 \n7-49 \n0-51 \n2-53 \n54-56 \n57-59 \n60-62 \n63-66 \n67-68 \n69-7l \n72-85 \n86-00 \nSecondary Skills \nfor determining what your character know \nis to assign secondary skills. Secondvy \nskills are broad areas of expertise. Most cor- \nrespond to occupations that your character \nmay have been apprenticed in or otherwise \npicked up before besinning his adventuriF- \nlife. Secondary skills are much more germ \nthan nonweapon profiaencies. They should \nnot be used in combination with non- \nweapon proficiencies, which are \nlater. \nEvery player character has a \nsecondary skill. Ether choose one from \nTable 36 or take a chance and roll randomly. \nA random roll may result in one, two, or no \nsecondary skills. \nTable 36: SECONDARY SKULS \nDlOO \nSecondary Skill \nArmorer (make, rep, , - ____ \nate armor and weapons) \nn \nI \nI \nFisher (swimming, nets, and srna \nboat handling) \nForester (basic wood lore, lmh. \ning) \nGambler (knowledge of gam&% \ngames) \nGroom (animal handiirilc) \nHunter (basic wood lore, but€ \ning, basic tracking) \nJeweler (appraisa€ of gems and \njewelry) \nLeather worker lskinnine tm= \nnind \nLimnerIPainter \nappraisal of art < \nI \n_- \nI \nMason (stone-cutthg) \nMiner (stone-cutting, asspyinn) \nNavigator (astronomy, M - \nswimming, navigation) - \nSailor (sailing, swimming \nScribe (reading, writing, ba&- 1 \nmath) \nTailor/Weaver (weaving, sewir,, \nembroidery) \nTeamster/Freiehter (animal ban- \nshipwright (sailing, carpentry) \nv \ndling, wagon-repair) \nTrader/ Barterer (appraisal \ncommon goods) \nTrapper/Furrier (basic w \nskinning) \nWeaponsmith (make, repair, & \nevaluate weapons) \nWoodworker/Carpenter \ntry, carving) \nNO skill of measureable wnrth \nRoll twice (reroll any result of \n86-00)\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 54 | PDF_PAGE 55]\nI \nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proflciencies) \nOnce a cnaracter has a secondary skill, it \nis up to the player and the DM to determine \njust what the character can do with it. The \nitems in parentheses after each skill describe \nsome of the things the character knows. \nOther knowledge may be added with the \nDMs approval. Thus, a hunter might know \nthe basics of finding food in the wilderness, \nhow to read animal signs to identify the \ntypes of creatures in the area, the habits of \ndangerous animals, and how to stalk wild \nanimals. \nLike the previous method (\"Using What \nYou Know\"), this method has strengths and \nweaknesses. Secondary skills do not pro- \nvide any rules for determining whether a \ncharacter succeeds when he uses a skill to do \nsomething difficult. It is safe to assume that \nsimple jobs succeed automatically. (A \nhunter could find food for himself without \nany difficulty.) For more complicated tasks, \nthe DM must assign a chance for success. He \ncan assign a percentage chance, have the \ncharacter make a saving throw, or require \nan Ability check (see Glossary). The DM \nstill has a lot of flexibility. \nThis flexibility means the DM must some- \ntimes make up the rule to cover the situa- \ntion, however. As mentioned earlier, some \nDMs enjoy this; others do not, their \nstrengths being elsewhere. While secondary \nskills define and limit the player's options, \nthey do not greatly simplify the DMs job. \nNonweapon Proflclencles \nThe most detailed \nmethod for handling character skills is that \nof nonweapon proficiencies. These are \nmuch lie weapon proficiencies. Each char- \nacter starts with a specific number of non- \nweapon proficiency slots and then earns \nadditional slots as he advances. Initial slots \nmust be assigned immediately; they cannot \nbe saved or held in reserve. \nNonweapon proficiencies are the most \ndetailed way to handle the question of what \nthe player character knows. They allow the \nplayer to choose from a broad selection and \ndefine the effects of each choice. Like the \nother methods, however, this system is not \nwithout drawbacks. First, nonweapon pro- \nficiencies are rigid. Being so defined, they \nlimit the options of both the player and DM. \nAt the same time, there will still be ques- \ntions unanswered by these proficiencies. \nWhereas before such questions were broad, \nthey will now tend to be more precise and \ndetailed. Secondly, using this system \nincreases the amount of time needed to cre- \nate a character. While the end result is a \nmore complete, well-rounded person, dt- \nup time can take up to two or three hours. \nNovice players especially may be over- \nwhelmed by the number of choices and \nrules. \nUnlike weapon proficiencies, in which \nsome weapons are not available to certain \ncharacter classes, all nonweapon proficien- \ncies are available to all characters. Some \nnonweapon proficiencies are easier for cer- \ntain character classes to learn, however. \nTable 37 lists all nonweapon proficien- \ncies. They are divided into categories that \n' correspond to character groups. The profi- \nciencies listed under each group can be \nlearned easily by characters of that group. \nA fifth category-\"General\"-contains \nproficiencies that can be learned easily by \nany character. \nRefer to Table 38. When a player selects a \nnonweapon proficiency from those catego- \nries listed under \"Proficiency Croups\" for \nhis character's group, it requires the number \nof proficiency slots listed in Table 37. When \na player selects a proficiency from any other \ncategory, it requires one additional profi- \nciency slot beyond the number listed. \nTable 37: NOWEAPON PROFICIENCY GROUPS \nGENERAL \n# of Slots \nProficiency Required \nAgriculture 1 \nAnimal Handling 1 \nChedC Relevant \nAbility Modifier \nIntelligence 0 \nWisdom -1 \nCarpentry \nCobbling \n1 Strength \n1 Dexterity \n0 \n0 \nFishing 1 Wisdom -1 \nHeraldrv 1 Intdlim-nrr n \nRidinn.

If the task is simple \nor the proficiency has only limited game use \n(such as cobbling or carpentry), a profi- \nciency check is generally not required. If the \ntask the character is trying to perform is dif- \nficult or subject to failure, a proficiency \ncheck is required. Read the descriptions of \nthe proficiencies for details about how and \nwhen each can be used. \n55 \nIf a proficiency check is required, Table 37 \nlists which ability is used with each profi- \nciency. Add the modifier (either positive or \nnegative) listed in Table 37 to the appropri- \nate ability score. Then the player rolls ld20. \nIf the roll is equal to or less than the charac- \nter’s adjusted ability score, the character ac- \ncomplished what he was trying to do. If the \nroll is greater than the character’s ability \nscore, the character fails at the task. (A roll \nof 20 always fails.) The DM determines \nwhat effects, if any, accompany failure. \nOf course, to use a proficiency, the char- \nacter must have any tools and materials \nneeded to do the job. A carpenter can do \nvery little without his tools, and a smith is \nvirtually helpless without a good forge. The \ncharacter must also have enough time to do \nthe job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency en- \nables your character to build a house, but \nnot in a single day1 Some proficiency de- \nscriptions state how much time is requid \nfor certain jobs. Most, however, are left to \nthe DMs judgment. \nThe DM can raise or lower a character’s \nchance of success if the situation calls for \nit. Factors that can affect a proficiency \ncheck inclwde availability and quality of \ntools, quality of raw material used, time \nspent doing the job, difficulty of the job, \nand how familiar the character is with the \ntask. A positive modifier is added to the \nability score used for the check. A negative \nmodifier is subtracted from the ability \nscore. \nRath, skilled as a blacksmith, has been \nmaking horseshoes for years. Because he is \nso familiar with the task and has every tool \nhe needs, the DM lets him make ho~ocs \nautomatically, without risk of failure. How- \never, Delsenora has persuaded Rath to make \nan elaborate wrought-iron cage (she needs it \nto create a magical item). Rath has never \ndone this before and the work is very intri- \ncate, so the DM imposes a penalty of - 3 on \nRaths ability check. \nWhen two proficient cheers work to- \ngether on the same task, the highest ability \nscore is used (the one with the greatest \nchance of success). Furthermore, a +1 bo- \nnus is added for the other character’s assist- \nance. The bonus can never be more than \n+ 1, as having too many assistants is some- \ntimes worse than having none. \nNonweapon proficiencies can also be im- \nproved beyond the ability score the charac- \nter starts with. For every additional \nproficiency slot a character spends on a \nnonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bo- \nnus to those proficiency checks. Thus, Rath \n(were he not an adventurer) might spend his \nadditional proficiency slots on blacksmith- \ning, to become a very good blacksmith, \ngaining a +1, +2, +3, or greater bonus to \nhis ability checks. \nMany non-player craftsmen are more ac- \ncomplished in their fields than player\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 56 | PDF_PAGE 57]\nProficiencies (Nonwenpon Proficiency Descriptions) \ncharacters, having devoted all their energies \nto improving a single proficiency. Likewise, \nold masters normally have more talent than \nyoung apprentices-unless the youth has an \nexceptional ability score! However, age is \nno assurance of talent. Remember that \nknowing a skill and being good at it are two \ndifferent things. There are bad potters, \nmediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All \nthis has much less to do with age than with \ndedication and talent. \n-RofkiencYDcsulptiom \nThe following pro- \nficiency descriptions are arranged alphabet- \nically, not according to character class. Each \ndescription gives a general outline of what a \ncharacter with the proficiency knows and \ncan do. Furthermore, some descriptions \ninclude rules to cover specific uses or situa- \ntions, or exact instructions on the effects of \nthe proficiency. \nAgrlculturp: The character has a knowl- \nedge of the basics of farming. This includes \nplanting, harvesting, storing crsps, tending \nanimals, butchering, and other typical \nfarming chores. \nAncient History: The character has \nlearned the legends, lore, and history of \nsome ancient time and place. The knowl- \nedge must be specific, just as a historian \nwould specialize today in the English Mid- \ndle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the \nRoman Republic before Caesar. (The DM \neither can have ancient periods in mind for \nhis game or can allow the players to name \nand designate them.) Thus, a player charac- \nter could how details about the Age of \nThorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea- \nRaiders or whatever else was available. \nThe knowledge acquired gives the hac- \nter familiarity with the principal legends, \nhistorical events, characters, locations, bat- \ntles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and \nmagical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and \noddities of the time. The character must roll \na Proficiency check to identify places or \nthings he encounters from that age. For \nexample, Rath knows quite a bit about the \nComing of the Trolls, a particularly dark \nperiod of dwwen history. Moving through \nsome deep caverns, he and his companions \nstumble across an ancient portal, sealed for \nuntold ages. Studying the handiwork, he \nrealizes (rolls a successfd proficiency check) \nthat it bears several seals similar to those he \nhas seen on \"banned\" portals from the time \nof Angnar, doorways to the legendary \nrealm of Trolhel. \nAnimal Handling Proficiency in this area \nenables a character to exercise a greater- \nthan-normal degree of control over pack \nanimals and beasts of burden. A successful \nproficiency check indicates that the charac- \nter has succeeded in calming an excited or \n, \nY \n\\ \nagitated animal; in contrast, a character \nwithout this proficiency has only a 20% \nchance of succeeding in the attempt. \nAnimal Lore: This proficiency enables a \ncharacter to observe the actions or habitat \nof an animal and interpret what is going on. \nActions can show how dangerous the crea- \nture is, whether it is hungry, protecting its \nyoung, or defending a nearby den. Further \nmore, careful observation of sbs and \nbehaviors can even indicate thc location of a \nwater hole, animal herd, predator, or \nimpending danger, such as a forest fin. The \nDM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A \nsuccessful check means the character under- \nstood the basic actions of the creature. If the \ncheck fails by 4 or less, no information is \ngained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the \ncharacter misinterprets the actions of the \nanimal. \nA character may also imitate the caIls and \ncries of animals that he is reasonably familiar \nwith, based on his badrground. This ability \nis limited by volume. The roar of a tyranno- \nsaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a \nnormal character. A succtsafd proficiency \ncheck means that onky magical means can \ndis- the character's call from that of \nthe true anima. The cry is sufficient to fool \nanimals, perhaps frightening them away or \nluringthem closer. Afailedchdmeansthe \nsound is incorrect in some slight way. A \nfailed call may still fool some listeners, but \navaturesvexyfamiliarwiththeayautomat- \nically detect a false call. AU other creatures \nandcharactem are alld a Widom cheek \nto detect the fake. \nFinally, animal lore increases the chance \nof sucay setting snares and traps (for \nhunting) since the Charaacrh the gen- \neral habits of the creature kted. \nAninul TnMne: Characters with this \nproficiency can train one type of avatum \n(declared when the proficiency is chm) to \nobey simple commands and perfonn tricks. \nA character can spend additional pmficien- \ncis to train other types of crutures or can \nimprove his skill with an already chosen \ntype. Creatures typically trained are dogs, \nhorses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, \nand parrots. A character can choose even \nmore exotic creatures and monsters with \ncult to control). \nA trainer can woik with up to three crea- \ntures at one time. The trainer may choose to \nteach general tasks or specific tricks. A gen- \neral task gives the creature the ability to \nreact to a number of nonqxdic commands \nto do its job. Examples of tasks include \nanimal intelligew (dthough these are diffi-\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 57 | PDF_PAGE 58]\nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nguard and attack, carry a rider, perform \nheavy labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside \nsoldiers (such as a war horse or elephant). A \nspecific trick teaches the trained creature to \ndo one specific action. A horse may rear on \ncommand, a falcon may pluck a designated \nobject, a dog may attack a specific person, \nor a rat may run through a particular maze. \n~ With enough time, a creature can be trained \n' -to do both general tasks and specific tricks. \nTraining for a general task requires three \nmonths of uninterrupted work. Training for \na specific trick requires M6 weeks. At the \nend of the training time, a proficiency check \nis made. If successful, the animal is trained. \nIf the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. \nAn animal can be trained in 2d4 general \ntasks or specific tricks, or any combination \nof thetwo. \nAn animal trainer can also try to tame \nwild animals (preparing them for training \nlater on). Wild animals can be tamed only \nwhen they are very young. The taming \nrequires one month of uninterrupted work \nwith the creature. At the end of the month, a \nproficiency check is made. If successful, the \nbeast is suitable for training. If the check \nfails, the creature retains enough of its wild \nbehavior to make it untrainable. It can be \nkept, though it must be leashed or caged. \nAppraising: This proficiency is highly \nuseful for thieves, as it allows characters to \nestimate the value and authenticity of \nantiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gem- \nstones, or other crafted items they find \n(although the DM can exclude those items \ntoo exotic or rare to be well known). The \ncharacter must have the item in hand to \nexamine. A successful proficiency check \n(rolled by the DM) enables the character to \nestimate the value of the item to the nearest \n100 or 1,ooO gp and to identify fakes. On a \nfailed check, thecharacter cannot estimate a \nprice at all. On a roll of 20, the character \nwildly misreads the value of the item, \nalways to the detriment of the character. \nArmorer: This character can make all of \nthe types of armor listed in the Players \nHandbook, given the proper materials and \nfacilities. When making armor, the profi- \nciency check is rolled at the end of the nor- \nmal construction time. \nThe time required to make armor is equal \nto two weeks per level of AC below 10. For \nexample, a shield would require two weeks \nof work, whereas a suit of full plate armor \nwould require 18 weeks of work. \nIf the proficiency check indicates failure \nbut is within 4 of the amount needed for suc- \ncess, the armorer has created usable, but \nflawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 \nAC worse than usual, although it looks like \nthe armor it was intended to be. Only a \ncharacter with armorer proficiency can \ndetect the flaws, and this requires careful \nand detailed inspection. \nIf the flawed armor is struck in meIee \ncombat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20. it \nbreaks. The character's AC immediately \nworsens by 4 additional classes (although \nnever above IO), and the broken armor \nhampers the character's movement. Until \nthe character can remove the broken armor \n(a process requiring ld4 rounds), the char- \nacter moves at 1h of his normal rate and suf- \nfers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls. \nIf an armorer is creating a suit of field \nplate or full plate armor, the character who \nwill use the armor must be present at least \nonce a week during the creation of the \narmor, since such types of armor require \nvery exact fitting. \nArtistic Ability: Player characters with \nartistic ability are naturally accomplished in \nvarious forms of the arts. They have an \ninherent understanding of color, form, \nspace, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Char- \nacters with artistic ability must select one \nart form (painting, sculpture, composition, \netc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can \nattempt to create art works or musical com- \npositions in their given field. Although it is \nnot necessary to makb a proficiency check, \none can be made to determine the quality of \nthe work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the \nartist has created a work with some truly \nlasting value. If the check fails, the artist has \ncreated something aesthetically unpleasing \nor just plain bad. \nArtistic ability also confers a + 1 bonus to \nall proficiency checks requiring artistic \nskill-music or dance-and to attempts to \nappraise objects of art. \nAstrology: This proficiency gives the \ncharacter some understanding of the sup- \nposed influences of the stars. Knowing the \nbirth date and time of any person, the \nastrologer can study the stars and celestial \nevents and then prepare a forecast of the \nfuture for that person. The astrologer's \ninsight into the future is limited to the next \n30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. \nIf a successful proficiency check is made, the \nastrologer can foresee some genera \n57 \na great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship \nmade, etc. The DM decides the exact predic- \ntion (based on his intentions for the next few \ngaming sessions). Note that the prediction \ndoes not guarantee the result-it only indi- \ncates the potential result. If the proficiency \ncheck is failed, no information is gained \nunless a 20 is rolled, in which case the pre- \ndiction is wildly inaccurate. \nClearly this proficiency requires prepara- \ntion and advance knowledge on the part of \nthe DM. Because of this, it is permhible for \nthe DM to avoid the question, although this \nshouldn't be done all the time. Players who \nwant to make their DMs life easier (always \na good idea) should consider using this pro- \nficiency at the end of a gaming don, giv- \ning the DM until the next don to come up \nwith an answer. The DM can use this profi- \nciency as a catalyst and guide for his \nadventures-something that will prompt \nthe player characters to go to certain places \nor to try new things. \nCharacters with the astrology proficiency \ngain a + 1 bonus to all navigation proficien- \ncy checks, provided the stars can be seen. \nBlacksmithing: A character with black- \nsmithing proficiency is capable of making \ntools and implements from iron. Use of the \nproficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed \nfire and bellows, as well as a hammer and \nanvil. The character cannot make armor or \nmost weapons, but can craft crowbars, \ngrappling hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, \nplows, and most other iron objects. \nBHnd-fightht~ A character drh blind- \nfighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of \npoor or no light (but this proficiency does \nnot allow spell use). In total darkness, the \ncharacter suffers only a -2 penalty to his \nattack roll (as compared to a -4 penalty \nwithout this proficiency). Under starlight or \nmoonlight, the character incurs only a -1 \npenalty. The character suffers no penalties \nto his AC because of darkness. \nFurthermore, the character retains special \nabilities that would normally be lost in \ndarkness, although the effectiveness of these \nare reduced by one-half (phcy checks \nare made at half the nom1 score, et.). \nThis proficiency is effestive only against \nopponents or threats within melee distance \nof the character. Blind-fighting does not \ngrant any special protection from missile \nfire or anything outside the immediate range \nof the character's melee weapon. Thus AC \npenalties remain for missile fire. (By the \ntime the character hears the whoosh of the \narrow, for example, it is too late for him to \nreact.) \nWhile moving in darkness, the character \nsuffers only half the normal movement pen- \nalty of those without this proficiency. \nFurthermore, this skill aids the character \nwhen dealing with invisible creatures, \nreducing the attack penalty to -2. How- \nr, it does not enable the character to dis- \nf\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 58 | PDF_PAGE 59]\nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) I \ncover invisible creatures; he has only a gen- \neral idea of their location and cannot target \nthem exactly. \nBowyedFletcher: This character can \nmake bows and arrows of the types given in \nTable 44, page 68. \nA weaponsmith is required to fashion \narrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can \nperform all other necessary functions. The \nconstruction time for a long or short bow is \none week, while composite bows require \ntwo weeks, and ld6 arrows can be made in \none day. \nWhen the construction time for the weap- \non is completed, the player makes a profi- \nciency check. If the check is successful, the \nweapon is of fine quality and will last for \nmany years of normal use without break- \ning. If the check fails, the weapon is still usa- \nble, but has a limited life span: An arrow \nbreaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the \ncharacter using it rolls an unmodified 1 on \nhis Id20 attack roll. \nOption: If a character wishes to create a \nweapon of truly fine quality and the DM \nallows it, the player can opt to use the fol- \nlowing alternative procedure for determin- \ning the success of his attempt. When the \nproficiency check is made, any failure \nmeans that the weapon is useless. However, \na successful check means that the weapon \nenables the character to add Strength \nbonuses to attack and damage rolls. Addi- \ntionally, if the proficiency check is a natural \n1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards \nfor all range classes or is of such fine work \nthat it is suitable for enchantment. \nBrewing: The character is trained in the \nart of brewing beers and other strong drink. \nThe character can prepare brewing formu- \nlas, select quality ingredients, set up and \nmanage a brewery, control fermentation, \nand age the finished product. \nCarpentry: The carpentry proficiency \nenables the character to do woodworking \njobs: buildmg houses, cabinetry, joinery, \netc. Tools and materials must be available. \nThe character can build basic items from \nexperience, without the need for plans. \nUnusual and more complicated items (a cat- \napult, for example) require plans prepared \nby an engineer. Truly unusual or highly \ncomplex items (wooden clockwork mecha- \nnisms, for example) require a proficiency \ncheck. \nCharioteering: A character with profi- \nciency in this skill is able to safely guide a \nchariot, over any type of terrain that can \nnormally be negotiated, at a rate V3 faster \nthan the normal movement rate for a char- \niot driven by a character without this profi- \nciency. Note that this proficiency does not \nimpart the ability to move a chariot over \nterrain that it cannot traverse: even the best \ncharioteer in the world cannot take such a \nvehicle into the mountains. \nCobbling: The character can fashion and \nrepair shoes, boots, and sandals. \nCooking: Although all characters have \nrudimentary cooking skills, the character \nwith this proficiency is an accomplished \ncook. A proficiency check is required only \nwhen attempting to prepare a truly magnifi- \ncent meal worthy of a master chef. \nDancing: The character knows many \nstyles and varieties of dance, from folk \ndances to formal court balls. \nDirection Sense. A character with this \nproficiency has an innate sense of direction. \nBy concentrating for ld6 rounds, the char- \nacter can try to determine the direction the \nparty is headed. If the check fails but is less \nthan 20, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a \n20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly \nopposite the true heading. (The DM rolls \nthe check.) \nFurthermore, when traveling in the wil- \nderness, a character with direction sense has \nthe chance of becoming lost reduced by 5 % . \nDisguise: The character with this skill is \ntrained in the art of disguise. He can make \nhimself look like any general type of person \nof about the same height, age, weight, and \nrace. A successful proficiency check indi- \ncates that the disguise is successful, while a \nfailed roll means the attempt was too obvi- \nous in some way. \nThe character can also disguise himself as \na member of another race or sex. In this \ncase, a -7 penalty is applied to the profi- \nciency check. The character may also \nattempt to disguise himself as a specific per- \nson, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency \ncheck. These modifiers are cumulative, thus \nit is extremely difficult for a character to dis- \nguise himself as a specific person of another \nrace or sex (a - 17 penalty to the check). \nEndurance: A character with endurance \nproficiency is able to perform continual \nstrenuous physical activity for twice as long \nas a normal character before becoming sub- \nject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. \nIn those cases where extreme endurance is \nrequired, a successful proficiency check \nmust be made. Note that this proficiency \ndoes not enable a character to extend the \nlength of time that he can remain unaffected \nby a lack of food or water. \nEngineering: The character is trained as a \nbuilder of both great and small things. Engi- \nneers can prepare plans for everything from \nsimple machines (catapults, river locks, \n58 \ngrist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, \ndams). A proficiency check is required only \nwhen designing something particularly \ncomplicated or unusual. An engineer must \nstill find talented workmen to carry out his \nplan, but he is trained to supervise and man- \nage their work. \nAn engineer is also familiar with the prin- \nciples of siegecraft and can detect flaws in \nthe defenses of a castle or similar construc- \ntion. He knows how to construct and use \nsiege weapons and machines, such as cata- \npults, rams, and screws. \nEtiquette: This proficiency gives the char- \nacter a basic understanding of the proper \nforms of behavior and address required in \nmany different situations, especially those \ninvolving nobility and persons of rank. \nThus, the character will know the correct \ntitle to use when addressing a duke, the \nproper steps of ceremony to greet visiting \ndiplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence \nof dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual \noccurrences, a proficiency check must be \nmade for the character to know the proper \netiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, \nfor example, is a sufficiently rare event). \nHowever, having the character know \nwhat is correct and actually do what is cor- \nrect are two different matters. The encoun- \nters must still be role-played by the \ncharacter. Knowledge of etiquette does not \ngive the character protection from a gaffe or \nfaux pas; many people who know the cor- \nrect thing still manage to do the exact oppo- \nsite. \nFire-building: A character with fire- \nbuilding proficiency does not normally need \na tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry \nwood and small pieces of tinder, he can start \na fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not \nrequired. Wet wood, high winds, or other \nadverse conditions increase the time to \n3d20, and a successful proficiency check \nmust be rolled to start a fire. \nFishing: The character is skilled in the art \nof fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or \nspear. Each hour the character spends fish- \ning, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is \nfailed, no fish are caught that hour. Other- \nwise, a hook and line or a spear will land \nfish equal to the difference between the die \nroll and the character's Wisdom score. A net \nwill catch three times this amount. \nOf course, no fish can be caught where no \nfish are found. On the other hand, some \nareas teem with fish, such as a river or pool \nduring spawning season. The DM may \nmodify the results according to the situa- \ntion. \nForgery: This proficiency enables the \ncharacter to create duplicates of documents \nand handwriting and to detect such forger- \nies created by others. To forge a document \n(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where \nthe handwriting is not specific to a person, \nthe character needs only to have Seen a simi-\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 59 | PDF_PAGE 60]\nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nlar document before. To forge a name, an \nautograph of that person is needed, and a \nproficiency check with a -2 penalty must \nbe successfully rolled. To forge a longer doc- \nument written in the hand of some particu- \nlar person, a large sample of his \nhandwriting is needed, with a - 3 penalty to \nthe check. \nIt is important to note that the forger \nti.. always thinks he has been successful; the \nDM rolls the character's proficiency check \nin secret and the forger does not learn of a \nfailure until it is too late. \nIf the check succeeds, the work will pass \nexamination by all except those intimately \nfamiliar with that handwriting or by those \nwith the forgery proficiency who examine \nthe document carefully. If the check is \nfailed, the forgery is detectable to anyone \nfamiliar with the type of document or \nhandwriting-if he examines the document \nclosely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is \nimmediately detectable to anyone who nor- \nmally handles such documents without \nclose examination. The forger will not real- \nize this until too late. \nFurthermore, those with forgery profi- \nciency may examine a document to learn if \nit is a forgery. On a successful proficiency \nroll, the authenticity of any document can \nbe ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a \n20 is not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a \n20 is rolled, the character reaches the incor- \nrect conclusion. \nGaming: The character knows most com- \nmon games of chance and skill, including \ncards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. \nWhen playing a game, the character may \neither play out the actual game (which may \ntake too much time for some) or make a pro- \nficiency check, with success indicating vic- \ntory. If two proficient characters play each \nother, the one with the highest successful die \nroll wins. A character with gaming profi- \nciency can also attempt to cheat, thus gain- \ning a +1 bonus to his ability score. If the \nproficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, \nhowever, the character has been caught \ncheating (even if he won the game). \nGem Cutting: A character with this profi- \nciency can finish the rough gems that are \ndiscovered through mining at a rate of Id10 \nstones per day. A gem cutter derives no ben- \nefit from the assistance of nonproficient \ncharacters. A gem cutter must work with a \ngood light source and must have an assort- \nment of chisels, small hammers, and special- \nUncut gems, while still of value, are not \nnearly as valuable as the finished product. If \nthe cutting is successful (as determined by a \nproficiency check), the gem cutter increases \nthe value of a given stone to the range \nappropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the \nwork is exceptionally brilliant and the value \nof the gem falls into the range for the next \nmost valuable gem (the DM has the relevant \n, ly hardened blades. \ntables). \nHealing A character proficient in healing \nknows how to use natural medicines and \nbasic principles of first aid and doctoring. If \nthe character tends another within one \nround of wounding (and makes a successful \nproficiency check), his ministrations restore \nId3 hit points (but no more hit points can be \nrestored than were lost in the previous \nround). Only one healing attempt can be \nmade on a character per day. \nIf a wounded character remains under the \ncare of someone with healing proficiency, \nthat character can recover lost hit points at \nthe rate of 1 per day even when traveling or \nengaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the \nwounded character gets complete rest, he \ncan recover 2 hit points per day while under \nsuch care. My characters with both heal- \ning and herbalism proficiencies can help \nothers recover at the rate of 3 hit points per \nday of rest. This care does not require a pro- \nficiency check, only the regular attention of \nthe proficient character. Up to six patients \ncan be cared for at any time. \nA character with healing proficiency can \nalso attempt to aid a poisoned individual, \nprovided the poison entered through a \nwound. If the poisoned character can be \ntended to immediately (the round after the \ncharacter is poisoned) and the care con- \ntinues for the next five rounds, the victim \ngains a + 2 bonus to his saving throw (delay \nhis saving throw until the last round of tend- \ning). No proficiency check is required, but \nthe poisoned character must be tended to \nimmediately (normally by sacrificing any \nother action by the proficient character) and \ncannot do anything himself. If the care and \nrest are interrupted, the poisoned character \nmust immediately roll a normal saving \nthrow for the poison. This result is unalter- \nable by normal means (Le., more healing \ndoesn't help). Only characters with both \nhealing and herbalism proficiencies can \nattempt the same treatment for poisons the \nvictim has swallowed or touched (the char- \nacter uses his healing to diagnose the poison \nand his herbalist knowledge to prepare a \npurgative). \nA character with healing proficiency can \nalso attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. \nWhen dealing with normal diseases, a suc- \ncessful proficiency check automatically \nreduces the disease to its mildest form and \nshortest duration. Those who also have her- \nbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 \nbonus to this check. A proficient character \ncan also attempt to deal with magical dis- \neases, whether caused by spells or creatures. \nIn this case, a successful proficiency check \ndiagnoses the cause of the disease. How- \never, since the disease is magical in nature, it \ncan be treated only by magical means. \nHeraldry: The knowledge of heraldry \nenables the character to identify the differ- \nent crests and symbols that denote different \n59 \npersons and groups. Heraldry comes in \nmany forms and is used for many different \npurposes. It can be used to identify noble- \nmen, families, guilds, sects, legions, politi- \ncal factions, and castes. The symbols may \nappear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, \nembroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and \nmore. The symbols used may include geo- \nmetric patterns, calligraphed lines of script, \nfantastic beasts, religious symbols, and \nmagical seals (made for the express purpose \nof identification). Heraldry can vary from \nthe highly formalized rules and regulations \nof late medieval Europe to the knowledge of \ndifferent shield patterns and shapes used by \nAfrican tribesmen. \nThe character automatically knows the \ndifferent heraldic symbols of his homeland \nand whom they are associated with. In addi- \ntion, if the character makes a successful pro- \nficiency check, he can correctly identify the \nsigns and symbols of other lands, provided \nhe has at least a passing knowledge of the \ninhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is \nof little use upon first entering a foreign \nland, \nHerbalism Those with herbalist kqowl- \nedge can identify plants and fungus and pre- \npare nonmagical potions, poultices, \npowders, balms, salves, ointments, infu- \nsions, and plasters for medical and pseudo- \nI \nmedical purposes. They can also prepam \nnatural plant poisons and purgatives. The \nDM must decide the exact strength of such \npoisons based on the poison rules in the \nDMG. A character with both herbalism and \nhealing proficiencies gains bonuses when \nusing his healing talent (see the Healing pro- \nficiency). \nHunting: When in wilderness settings \ncharacter can attempt to stalk and b \ndown game. A proficiency check mus \nmade with a - 1 penalty to the ability score \nfor every nonproficient hunter in the party. \nIf the die roll is successful, the hunter (and \nthose with him) have come within 101 to \n200 yards (100 + IdI00) of an animal. The \ngroup can attempt to close the range, but a \nproficiency check must be made for each 20 \nyards closed. If the stalking is successful, the \nhunter automatically surprises the game. \nThe type of animal stalked depends on the \nnature of the terrain and the whim of the \nDM. \nJuggling: The character can juggle, a tal- \nent useful for entertainments, diversions, \nand certain rare emergencies. When jug- \ngling normally (to entertain or distract), no \nproficiency check is required. A check is \nmade when trying spectacular tricks \n(\"Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!\"). \nHowever, juggling also enables the charac- \nter to attempt desperate moves. On a SUC- \ncessful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a \nproficiency check), the character can catch \nsmall items thrown to harm him (as \nopposed to items thrown for him to catch). \nI\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 60 | PDF_PAGE 61]\nI \nI \nI\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 61 | PDF_PAGE 62]\nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nThus the character could catch a dagger or a \ndart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, \nhowever, the character automatically suf- \nfers damage (sticking your hand in the path \nof a dagger is likely to hurt). \nJumping: The character can attempt \nexceptional leaps both vertically and hor- \nizontally. If the character has at least a 20- \nfoot running start, he can leap (broad jump) \n4d6 + his level in feet. No character can \nbroad jump more than six times his height, \nhowever. With the same start, he can leap \nvertically (high jump) Id3 plus half his level \nin feet. No character can high jump more \nthan 1% times his own height. \nFrom a standing start, a character with \nthis proficiency can broad jump ld6 plus \nhalf his level in feet and high jump only \nthree feet. \nThe character can also attempt vaults \nusing a pole. A vault requires at least a 30- \nfoot running start. If a pole is used, it must \nbe four to 10 feet longer than the character’s \nheight. The vault spans a distance equal to \n1% times the length of the pole. The charac- \nter can clear heights equal to the height of \nthe pole. He can also choose to land on his \nfeet if the vault carries him over an obstacle \nno higher than Vz the height of his pole. \nThus, using a 12-foot pole, the character \ncould either vault through a window 12 feet \noff the ground (tumbling into the room \nbeyond), land on his feet in an opening six \nfeet off the ground, or vault across a moat \n18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped \nat the end of the vault. \nLanguages, Ancient: The character has \nmastered a difficult and obscure tongue, \nnow primarily found in the writings of \npedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use \nof the language is to read tomes of ancient \nsecrets written by longdead mystics. This \nproficiency enables the character to either \nread and write or speak the language (his \nchoice). \nLanguages, Modem: The character has \nlearned to speak a language of the known \nworld. To do so, there must be a teacher \navailable. This could be another player \ncharacter, an NPC hireling, or simply a \nlocal townsman. \nLeathemorking. This proficiency enables \na character to tan and treat leather and to \nmake clothing and other leather objects. \nThe character can make leather armor, as \nwell as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and \nall sorts of harnesses. \nLocal History: The character is a store- \nhouse of facts about the history of a region \nthe size of a large county or a small prov- \nince. The character knows when the ruined \ntower on the hill was built and who built it \n(and what happened to him), what great \nheroes and villains fought and fell at the old \nbattlefield, what great treasure is supposed \nto be kept in a local temple, how the mayor \nof the next town miraculously grew hair on \nhis balding pate, and more. \nThe DM will provide information about \nlocal sites and events as the character needs \nto know them. Furthermore, the character \ncan try to retell these events as entertaining \nstories. Once the subject is chosen, he can \neither make a proficiency check and, if suc- \ncessful, add that tale to his repertoire, or \nactually tell the story to other characters. If \nthe character succeeds in entertaining them, \nthe player need not make a proficiency roll \nfor the character, since he has succeeded. \nThe character can tell these stories to enter- \ntain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his \nCharisma for the encounter. But telling sto- \nries to hostile beings is probably not going \nto do any good. \nMining. A character with mining profi- \nciency is needed to site and supervise the \noperations of any mine. First, the character \ncan attempt to determine what types of ores \nor gems can be found in a given area. To do \nthis, he must spend at least a week searching \na four-square-mile area. The DM may rule \nthat more area must be searched to find any- \nthing of value and may thus increase the \namount of time required. At the end of the \nsearch, the character can say what is likely \nto be found in this area. After this, the char- \nacter can site the mine. On a successful pro- \nficiency check (made secretly by the DM), \nthe character has found a good site to begin \nmining for any minerals that may be in the \narea. The check does not guarantee a suc- \ncessful mine, only that a particular site is the \nbest choice in a given area. The DM must \ndetermine what minerals, if any, are to be \nfound in the region of the mine. On a failed \ncheck, the character only thinks he has \nfound a good site. Much effort is spent \nbefore the character is proved wrong, of \ncourse. \nOnce the mine is in operation, a character \nwith mining proficiency must remain on- \nsite to supervise all work. Although this is a \nsteady job, most player characters will find \nit better to hire an NPC for this purpose. \nMountaineerins A character with this \nproficiency can make difficult and danger- \nous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the \naid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with \nmountaineering proficiency leads a party, \nplacing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the \nothers, all in the party can gain the benefit \nof his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide \na party up a cliff face it could not otherwise \nclimb. A character with this proficiency \ngains a 10 percent bonus per proficiency slot \nspent to his chance to climb any surface. \nNote that mountaineering is not the same as \nthe thief‘s climbing ability, since the latter \ndoes not require aids of any sort. \nMusical Instrument: The character can \nplay a specific musical instrument. An addi- \ntional instrument can be added for every \nextra slot devoted to this proficiency. The \ncharacter plays quite well, and no proficien- \n61 \ncy check is normally requ \ndirect the character to-make a proficiency \ncheck in what he feels are extraordinary cir- \ncumstances. \nNavigation: The character has learned the \narts of navigating by the stars, studying cur- \nrents, and watc for telltale signs of \nland, reefs, and hid 9 en danger. This is not \nparticularly useful on land. At sea, a suc- \ncessful proficiency check by the navigator \nreduces the chance of getting lost by 20 per- \ncent. \nPottery: A character with this proficiency \ncan create any type of clay vessel or con- \ntainer commonly used in the campaign \nworld. The character requires a wheel and a \nkiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. \nThe character can generally create two \nsmall- or medium-sized items or one large- \nsized item per day. The pieces of pottery \nmust then be fired in the kiln for an addi- \ntional day. \nThe raw materials involved cost three cp \nto make a small item, five cp to make a \nmedium-sized item, and one sp to make a \nlarge item. \nReading Lips: The character can under- \nstand the speech of those he can see but not \nhear. When this proficiency is chosen, the \nplayer must specify what language the char- \nacter can lip read (it must be a language the \ncharacter can already speak). To use the \nproficiency, the character must be within 30 \nfeet of the speaker and be able to see him \nspeak. A proficiency check is made. If the \ncheck fails, nothing is learned. If the check is \nsuccessful, 70 percent of the conversation is \nunderstood. Since certain sounds are impos- \nsible to differentiate, the understanding of a \nlip-read conversation is never better than \nthis. \nReadinglWriting. The character can read \nand write a modern language he can speak, \nprovided there is someone available to teach \nthe character (another PC, a hireling, or an \nNPC). This proficiency does not enable the \ncharacter to learn ancient languages (see \nLanguages, Ancient). \nReligion: Characters with religion profi- \nciency know the common beliefs and cults \nof their homeland and the major faiths of \nneighboring regions. Ordinary information \n(type of religious symbol used, basic atti- \ntude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is \nautomatically known by the character. Sp- \ncial information, such as how the clergy is \norganized or the significance of particular \nholy days, requires a proficiency check. \nAdditional proficiencies spent on religion \nenable the character either to expand his \ngeneral knowledge into more distant \nregions (using the guidelines above) or to \ngain precise information about a single \nfaith. If the latter is chosen, the character is \nno longer required to make a proficiency \ncheck when answering questions about that \nreligion. Such expert knowledge is highly\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 62 | PDF_PAGE 63]\nuseful to priest characters when dealing \nwith their own and rival faiths. \nRiding, Airborne: The character is trained \nin handling a flying mount. The particular \ncreature must be chosen when the proficien- \ncy is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can \nbe used to learn how to handle other types of \nmounts. Unlike land-based riding, a charac- \nter must have this proficiency (or ride with \nsomeone who does) to handle a flying \nmount. In addition, a proficient character \ncan do the following: \n* Leap onto the saddle of the creature \n(when it is standing on the ground) and spur \nit airborne as a single action. This requires \nno proficiency check. \n* Leap from the back of the mount and \ndrop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back \nof another mount (land-based or flying). \nThose with only light encumbrance can \ndrop to the ground without a proficiency \ncheck. In all other situations, a proficiency \ncheck is required. A failed roll means the \ncharacter takes normal falling damage (for \nfalling flat on his face) or misses his target \n(perhaps taking large amounts of damage as \na result). A character who is dropping to the \nground can attempt an immediate melee \nattack, if his proficiency check is made with \na -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has \nthe consequences given above. \nSpur his mount to greater speeds on a \nsuccessful check, adding ld4 to the move- \nment rate of the mount. This speed can be \nmaintained for four consecutive rounds. If \nthe check fails, an attempt can be made \nagain the next round. If two checks fail, no \nattempt can be made for a full turn. After \nthe rounds of increased speed, its movement \ndrops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneu- \nverability Class (see Glossary) becomes one \nclass worse. These conditions last until the \nmount lands and is allowed to rest for at \nleast one hour. \n* The rider can guide the mount with his \nknees and feet, keeping his hands free. A \nproficiency check is made only after the \ncharacter suffers damage. If the check is \nfailed, the character is knocked from the \nsaddle. A second check is allowed to see if \nthe character manages to catch himself (thus \nhanging from the side by one hand or in \nsome equally perilous position). If this fails, \nthe rider falls. Of course a rider can strap \nhimself into the saddle, although this could \nbe a disadvantage if his mount is slain and \nplummets toward the ground. \nRiding, Land-Based: Those skilled in land \nriding are proficient in the art of riding and \nhandling horses or other types of ground \nmounts. When the proficiency slot is filled, \nthe character must declare which type of \nmount he is proficient in. Possibilities \ninclude griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and \nvirtually any creatures used as mounts by \nhumans, demihumans, or humanoids. \nA character with riding proficiency can \nperform all of the following feats. Some of \nthem are automatic, while others require a \nproficiency check for success. \nThe character can vault onto a saddle \nwhenever the horse or other mount is stand- \ning still, even when the character is wearing \narmor. This does not require a proficiency \ncheck. The character must make a check, \nhowever, if he wishes to get the mount mov- \ning during the same round in which he lands \nin its saddle. He must also make a proficien- \ncy check if he attempts to vault onto the sad- \ndle of a moving mount. Failure indicates \nthat the character falls to the ground- \npresumably quite embarrassed. \nThe character can urge the mount to \njump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No \ncheck is required if the obstacle is less than \nthree feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet \nwide. If the character wants to roll a profi- \nciency check, the mount can be urged to \nleap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump \nacross gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success \nmeans that the mount has made the jump. \nFailure indicates that it balks, and the char- \nacter must make another proficiency check \nto see whether he retains his seat or falls to \nthe ground. \n* The character can spur his steed on to \ngreat speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the \nanimal's movement rate for up to four \nturns. This requires a proficiency check \n62\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 63 | PDF_PAGE 64]\nProficlencies (Nonweapon Proficlency Descriptions) \neach turn to see if the mount can be pushed \nthis hard. If the initial check fails, no further \nattempts may be made, but the mount can \nmove normally. If the second or subsequent \ncheck fails, the mount immediately slows to \na walk, and the character must dismount \nand lead the animal for a turn. In any event, \nafter four turns of racing, the steed must be \nwalked by its dismounted rider for one turn. \n* The character can guide his mount with \nhisknees, enabling him to use weapons that \ntwo hands (such as bows and two- \nEzG swords) while mounted. This feat \ndoes not require a proficiency check unless \nthe character takes damage while so riding. \nIn this case, a check is required and failure \nmeans that the character falls to the ground \nand sustains an additional ld6 points of \ndamage. \n* The character can drop down and hang \nalongside the steed, using it as a shield \nagainst attack. The character cannot make \nan attack or wear armor while performing \nthis feat. The character’s Armor Class is \nlowered by 6 while this maneuver is per- \nforme+ Any attacks that would have struck \nthe character’s normal Armor Class are con- \nsidered to have struck the mount instead. \nNo proficiency check is required. \n* The character can leap from the back of \nhis steed to the ground and make a melee \nattack against any character or creature \nwithin 10 feet. The player must roll a suc- \ncessful proficiency check with a -4 penalty \nto succeed. On a failed roll, the character \nfails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the \ngrpund, and suffers Id3 points of damage. \nRope Use: This proficiency enables a \ncharacter to accomplish amazing feats with \nrope. A character with rope use proficiency \nis familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie \nknots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or \nloosen with a quick tug. If the character’s \nhands are bound and held with a knot, he \ncan roll a proficiency check (with a -6 pen- \nalty) to escape the bonds. \nThis character gains a +2 bonus to all \nattacks made with a lasso. The character \nalso receives a +10 percent bonus to all \nclimbing checks made while he is using a \nrope, including attempts to belay (secure the \nend of a climbing rope) companions. \nRunning: The character can move at \ntwice his normal movement rate for a day. \nAt the end of the day he must sleep for eight \nhours. After the first day’s movement, the \ncharacter must roll a proficiency check for \nsuccess. If the die roll succeeds, the charac- \nter can continue his running movement the \nnext day. If the die roll fails, the character \ncannot use his running ability the next day. \nIf involved in a battle during a day he spent \nrunning, he suffers a -1 penalty to his \nattack rolls. \nSeaaunshlp: The character is familiar \nwith boats and ships. He is qualified to \nwork as a crewman, although he cannot \nactually navigate. Crews of trained seamen \nare necessaTy to manage any ship, and they \nimprove the movement rates of inland boats \nby 50 percent. \nSeamstdailor: The character can sew \nand design clothing. He can also do all kinds \nof embroidery and ornamental work. \nAlthough no proficiency check is required, \nthe character must have at least needle and \nthread to work. \nSet Snares: The character can make sim- \nple snares and traps, primarily to catch \nsmall game. These can include rope snares \nand spring traps. A proficiency check must \nbe rolled when the snare is first constructed \nand every time the snare is set. A failed pro- \nficiency check means the trap does not work \nfor some reason. It may be that the work- \nmanship was bad, the character left too \nmuch scent in the area, or he poorly con- \ncealed the finished work. The exact nature \nof the problem does not need to be known. \nThe character can also attempt to set traps \nand Snares for larger creatures: tiger pits \nand net snares, for example. A proficiency \ncheck must be rolled, this time with a -4 \npenalty to the ability score. In both cases, \nsetting a successful snare does not ensure \nthat it catches anything, only that the snare \nworks if triggered. The DM must decide if \nthe trap is triggered. \nThief characters (and only thieves) with \nthis proficiency can also attempt to rig man- \ntraps. These can involve such things as \ncrossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, \netc. The procedure is the same as that for \nsetting a large snare. The DM must deter- \nmine the amount of damage caused by a \nman-trap . \nSetting a small snare or trap t&es one \nhour of work. Setting a larger trap requires \ntwo to three people (only one need have the \nproficiency) and 2d4 hours of work, Setting \na man-trap requires one or more people \n(depending on its nature) and Id8 hours of \nwork. To prepare any trap, the character \nmust have appropriate materials on hand. \nCharacters with animal lore proficiency \ngain a +2 bonus to their ability score when \nattempting to set a snare for the purposes of \ncatching game. Their knowledge of animals \nand the woods serves them well for t& pur- \npose. They gain no benefit when attempting \nto trap monsters or intelligent beings. \nSinging: The character is an accom- \nplished singer and can use this ability to \nentertain others and perhaps earn a small \nliving (note that bards can do this automati- \ncally). No proficiency check is required to \nsing. The character can also create choral \nworks on a successful Proficiency check. \nSpellcrpft: Although this proficiency does \nnot grant the character any spellcasting \npowers, it does give him familiarity-with the \ndifferent forms and rites of spellcasting. If \nhe obse~es and overhears someone who is \ncasting a spell, or if he examines the material \n63 \ncomponents used, he can attempt to identify \nthe spell being cast. A proficiency check \nmust be rolIed to make a correct idartificp- \ntion. Wizard specialists spin a +3 bonus to \nthecheckwhenattemptingtoihtifynagic \nof their own school. Note that since the \nspellcaster must be observed until the my \ninstant of casting, the spellcraft proficiaq \ndoes not grant an advantage rrgsinst combat \nspells. The proficiency is quite useful, how- \never, for identifying spells that would other- \nwise have no visible effect. \nThose talented in this proficiency abp \nhave a chance (equal to 111 of their \nproficiency check) of recogniziq masiu) or \nmagicauy endowed constructs for what \nthey are. \nStonemuow A stonemason is able to \nbuild structures from stone so that they loet \nmany years. He cpn do simple stone UN- \nings, such as lettering, colum, and flow= \nishes. The stone can be mortared, caddy \nfitted without mortar, or loose#y fitted ad \nchinked with rocks and earth. A stonemas- \non equipped with his tools (hammers, \nchisels, wedges, blodc and tackle) caa buiki \na plain section of wd one foot thick, tcn \nfeet long, and five feet high in one day, pro- \nvided the stone has already bem cut. A \nstonemason m4 also supervise the work of \nunskilled laborers to quarry \nstonemason is needed for every \ners. Dwarves are among the most accom- \nplished stonemasons in the work& they \nreceive a +2 bonus when using this skill. ~ \nSurvival: This proficiency must be \napplied to a specific environment-i.e., a \nspecific type of terrain and weather factors. \nTypical environments include arctic, woo& \nland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. \nThe character has basic survival knowkdsp \nfor that terrain type. Additional proritioncy \nslots can be used to add more types of ter- \nrain. \nA character skilled in survival has a basic \nthat land. He understands the effects of the \nweather and knows the proper steps to \nlessen the risk of exposure. He knows the \nmethods to locate or gather drinkabie \nwater. He knows how to find basic, not nec- \nessarily appetizing, food where none is \napparent, thus staving off starvation. Fur- \nthermore, a character with sunrival skill can \ninstruct and aid others in the same situation. \nWhen using the proficiency to find food or \nwater, the character must roll a proficiency \ncheck. If the check is failed, no more \nattempts can be made that day. \nThe survival skill in no way releases the \nplayer characters from the hardship and \nhorrors of being lost in the wilderness. At \nbest it alleviates a small portion of the suf- \nfering. The food found is barely adequate, \nand water is, discovered in miniscule \namounts. It is still quite possible for a char- \nacter with survival knowledge to die in the \nf 1 \n‘ \nknowledge of the hazards hc might face in\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 64 | PDF_PAGE 65]\nProficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nwilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the \ncharacter has may lead to .overconfidence \nand doom1 \nSmlmming: A character with swimming \nproficiency knows how to swim and can- \nmove according to the rules given in the \nSwimming section (page 120). Those with- \nout this proficiency carinot swim. They can \nhold their breath and float, but they cannot \nmove themselves about in the wat< \nTightrope WWs The character can \nattempt to walk narrow ropes or beams \nwith greater than normal chances of suc- \ncess. He can negotiate any narrow surface \nnot angled up or down greater than 45 \ndegrees. Each round the character can walk \n60 feet. One proficiency check is made eve- \nry 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indi- \ncating a fall. TRe check is made with a -10 \npenalty to the ability score if the surface is \none inch or less inwidth (a rope), a -5 pen- \nalty if two inches to six inches wide, and \nunm& if seven inches to 12 inches \nwide. Wider than one foot requires nacheck \nfM pr&cient characters under normal cir- \ncumstances. Every additional proficiency \nspnr on tightrope walking reduces these \npenalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduc- \nes the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in \nWline increases the penaltip by 2 to 6. \nTlte character can attempt to fight while \non a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty \nto uttadc roll ad must roll a successful \npsoHcisncy check at the beginnii of each \nround to avoid falling off. Since the charac- \nter cannot maneuver, he gains no adjust- \nments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he \nis struck while on the rope, he must roll an \nimmdiate proficiency check to retain his \nbalance. \n'hew Characters with tracking profi- \n. ciency are able to follow the trail of crea- \ntures and characters across most types of \nterrain. Characters who are not rangers roll \na proficiency check with a -6 penalty to \ntheir ability scores; rangers have no penalty \nto their ability scores. In addition, other \nmodifiers are also applied to the attempt, \naccording to Table 39. \nTable 3% TRACKING MODIFIERS \nTerrain \nSoft or muddy ground \nThick brush, vines, or reeds \nOccasional signs of passage, dust \nNormal ground, wood floor \nRocky ground or shallow water \nEvery two creatures in the group \nEvery 12 hours since trail was made \nEvery hour of rain, snow, or sleet \nPoor lighting (moon or starlight) \nTracked party attempts to hide trail \nMod. \n+4 \n+3 \n+2 \n0 \n- 10 \n+1 \n-1 \n-5 \n-6 \n-5 \nThe modifiers in Table 39 are cum- \nulative-total the modifiers for all condi- \ntions that apply and combine that with the \ntracker's Wisdom score to get the modified \nchance to track. \nFor example, if Thule's Wisdom score is \n16 and he is trying to track through mud \n(+4), at night (-6), during a sleet storm \n(-5), his chance to track is 9 (16 + 4 -6 \n-5). (Thule is a ranger, so he does not suffer \nthe -6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.) \nFor tracking to succeed, the creature \ntracked must leave some type of trail. Thus \nit is virtually impossible to track flying or \nnoncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow \nthis in rare instances, but he should also \nassign substantial penalties to the attempt. \nTo track a creature, the character must \nfirst find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must \nhave seen the creature in the last 30 minutes \nand must begin tracking from the place last \nseen. Outdoors, the tracker must either \nhave seen the creature, have eyewitness \nreports of its recent movement (\"Yup, we \nsaw them ora just high-tail it up that trail \nthere not but yesterday.\"), or must have \nobvious evidence that the creature is in the \narea (such as a well-used game trail). If these \nconditions are met, a proficiency check is \nrolled. Success means a trail has been \nfound. Failure means no trail is found. \nAnother attempt cannot be made until the \nabove conditions are met again under differ- \nent circumstances. \nOnce the trail is found, additional profi- \nciency checks are rolled for the following \nsituations: \n* The chance to track decreases (terrain, \nrain, creatures leaving the group, darkness, \netc.). \nA second track crosses the first. \n* The party resumes tracking after a halt \n(to rest, eat, fight, etc.). \nOnce the tracker fails a proficiency check, \nanother check can be rolled after spending \nat least one hour searching the area for new \nsigns. If this check is. fafed, no further \nattempts can be made. If several trackers are \nfolEovving a trail, a + 1 bonus is added to the \nability score of the most adept tracker. Once \nhe loses the trail, it is lost to all. \nIf the modifiers lower the chance to track \nbelow 0 (e.g., the modifiers are -11 and the \ncharacter's Wisdom is IO), the trail io totally \nlost to that character and further tracking is \nimpossible- (even if the chance later \nimproves). Other characters may be able to \ncontinue tracking, but that character can- \nnot. \nA tracking charatter can also attempt to \nidentify the type of creatures being followed \nand the approximate number by rolling a \nproficiency check. All the normal tracking \nmodifiers apply. One identifying check can \nbe rolled each time a check is rolled to fol- \nlow the trail. A succedul check identifies \nthe creatures (provided the character has \nsome knowledge of that type of creature) \nand gives a rough estimate of their numbers. \nJust how accurate this estimate is depends \non the DM. \n64 \nWhen following a trail, the character (and \nthose with him) must slow down, the speed \nhendinst on the character's modificd \n&e tokk as found from Table 39. \nTabk 4a MOVEMENT WHILE \nTRACKING \nChance to Track Movement Rke \n1-6 1/4 normal \n7-14 1/2 normal \n14 or greater 3/4 normal \nIn the earlier example, Thule has a mc \nfied tracking chance of 9,so he moves ai \nhis normal movement rate. \nTnsnWsgt The character is practiced in \nall manner of aqrobatics-dive, roils, som- \nersaults, handstands, flips, ctc. Tumbling \ncan only be performed while burdened with \nlight encumbrance or less. Aside from enter- \ntaining, the character with tumbling profi- \nciency can improve hi5 Armor Class by 4 \nagainst attacks directed solely at him in any \nround of combat, provided he has the initia- \ntive and foregoes d attacks that mud. \nWhen in manned combat he can improve \nhis attack roll by 2. \nOn a 6uca88fu1 proficiency check, he suf- \nfers only one-hdf the normal damage from \nfalls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of \n10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights \nresult in normal damage. \nVentriloquirm: The character has kd \nthe secrets of \"throwing his voice.\" Al- \nthough not actually making sound come \nfrom somewhere else (like the spell), the \ncharacter can deceive others into bebbg \nthis to be so.

One check must be made for eve \nsentence or response. The character is lim- \nited to sounds he could normally make (thus \nthe roar of a lion is somewhat beyond him). \nSince ventriloquism relies on deception, \npeople's knowledge of speech, and assump\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 65 | PDF_PAGE 66]\ntions about what should and shouldn't talk, \nit is effective only on intelligent creatures. \nThus it has no effect on animals and the like. \nFurthermore, the audience must be watch- \ning the character since part of the deception \nis visual (\"Hey, his lips don't movel\"). Using \nventriloquism to get someone to look \nbehind him does not work, since the voice is \nnot actually behind him (this requires the \nnentn'loquisrn spell). All but those with the \ngullibility of children realize what is truly \nhappening. They may be amused-or they \nday not be. \nL'I \nWeaponsmithlng: This highly specialized \nproficiency enables a character to perfom \nthe difficult and highly exacting work \ninvolved in making metal weapons, particu- \nlarly those with blades. The character \nblends some of the skill of the blacksmith \nwith an ability to create blades of strength \nand sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is \nnecessary to use this proficiency. \nThe time and cost to make various types \nof weapons are listed on Table 41. \nTable 41: WEAPON CONSTRUCTION \nConstruction Material \nWeapon Time cost \nArrowhead 10/day 1cP \nBattle Axe 10 davs 10 SD \nL. Crossbow 15 days 5 sp \nShort Sword 20 days 5 SP \nLone Sword 30 davs 10 SD \nWeather Sense: This proficiency enables \nthe character to make intelligent guesses \nabout upcoming weather conditions. A suc- \ncessful proficiency check means the charac- \nter has correctly guessed the general weath- \ner conditions in the next six hours. A failed \ncheck means the character read the signs \nwrong and forecast the weather incorrectly. \nThe DM should roll the check secretly. A \nproficiency check can be made once every \nsix hours. However, for every six hours of \nobservation, the character gains a + 1 bonus \nto his ability score (as he watches the weath- \ner change, the character gets a better sense \nof what is coming). This modifier is cumula- \ntive, although sleep or other activity that \noccupies the attention of the character for a \nlong period negates any accumulated \nbonus. \nSometimes impending weather condi- \ntions are so obvious that no proficiency \ncheck is required. It is difficult not to notice \nthe tornado funnel tearing across the plain \nor the mass of dark clouds on the horizon \nobviously headed the character's way. In \nthese cases, the player should be able to \ndeduce what is about to happen to his char- \nacter anyway. \nWeaving: A character with weaving pro- \nficiency is able to create garments, tapes- \ntries, and draperies from wool or cotton. \nThe character requires a spinning apparatus \nand a loom. A weaver can meat \nyards of material per day. \n65"
