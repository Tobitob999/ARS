If this saving throw\nis failed, the victim's movement rate is\nreduced by 1/3 from its current total (but a\ncreature's movement rate can never be less\nthan 1). This penalty lastsfor 24 hours, after\nwhich the character's normal movement\nrate is regained.\nWithout the use of a spell such as true see-\ning, similar magical aids, or some other spe- 1\ncia1 means of detection (such as detect traps\nor detect snares and pits), an area affected\nby spike growth is absolutely undetectable\nsphere: Plant\nas such until a victim enters the area and suf-\nfers damage. Even then, the creature cannot\ndetermine the extent of the perilous area\nunless some means of magical detection is\nUsed.\nThe components for this spell are the\npriest's holy symbol and either seven sharp\nthorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened\nto a point."
