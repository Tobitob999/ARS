The spell does not func-\ntion unless the priest is in good standing\nwith his deity. The basin of holy water be-\ncomes similar to a crystal bull. For each vial\nof capacity of the basin, the priest may scry\nfor one round, up to a maximum of one\nhour; thus, the duration of the mugic font\nspell is directly related to the size of the holy\nwater receptacle. The DM will know the\nchances of a character being able to detect\nSnying.\nThe priest’s holy symbol and the font and\nits trappings are not consumed by the spell."
