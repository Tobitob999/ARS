The duration of the created item\nvaries with its relative hardness and rarity:\nVegetable matter 2 hours/level\nStone or crystal 1 hour/level\nPrecious metals 2 turns/level\nGems 1 turn/level\nMithral 2 rounddlevel\nAdamantite 1 round/level\n* Includes similar rare metals.\nAttempting to use any of these as material\ncomponents in a spell will cause the spell to\nfail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny\npiece of matter of the same type as the item\nhe plans to create-a bit of twisted hemp to\ncreate rope, a chip of stone to create a boul-\nder, and so on."
