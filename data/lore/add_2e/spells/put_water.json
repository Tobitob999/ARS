The\ndepth and length of the trough created by\nthe spell depends on the level of the priest. A\ntrough three feet deep per caster level, by 30\nyards wide, by 20 yards long per level is cre-\nated. Thus at 12th level, the priest would\npart water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by\n240 yards long. The trough remains as long\nas the spell lasts or until the priest who cast\nit opts to end its effects. Existing currents\nappear to flow through the parted water,\nalthough swimming creatures and physical\nobjects such as boats do not enter the rift\nwithout strenuous and deliberate effort. If\ncast underwater, this spell creates an air cyl-\ninder of appropriate length and diameter. If\ncast directly on a water elemental or other\nwater-based creature, the creature receives\n4d8 points of damage and must roll a suc-\ncessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic\nfor 3d4 rounds.\nThe material component of this spell is\nthe Driest’s holv svmbol."
