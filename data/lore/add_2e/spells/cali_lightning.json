The\ncaster is then able to call down bolts of light-\nning. The caster can call down one bolt per\nturn. The caster need not call a bolt of light-\nning immediately-other actions, even\nspellcasting, can be performed; however,\nthe caster must remain stationary and con-\ncentrate for a full round each time a bolt is\ncalled. The spell has a duration of one turn\nper caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points\nof electrical damage, plus an additional Id8\npoints for each of the caster's experience\nlevels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a\n6d8 bolt (268 + 4d8).\nThe bolt of lightning flashes down in a\nvertical stroke at whatever distance the\nspellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away.\nAny creature within a 10-foot radius of the\npath or the point where the lightning strikes\nsuffers full damage unless a successful sav-\ning throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case\nonly one-half damage is taken.\nBecause it requires a storm overhead, this\nspell can only be used outdoors. It does not\nfunction under ground or under water."
