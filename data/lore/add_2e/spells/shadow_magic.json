For example, this spell can\nbe magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, or\nso on, and has normal effects upon crea-\ntures in the area of effect if they fail their\nsaving throws vs. spell. Thus a creature fail-\ning to save against a shadow magic fireball\nmust roll another saving throw, suffering\nhalf of the normal fireball damage if suc-\ncessful and full normal fireball damage if the\nsaving throw is failed. If the first saving\nthrow was successful, the shadow magic\nnature is detected and only 20% of the\nrolled damage is received (rounding down\nbelow fractions below .4 and rounding up\nI\nfractions of .4 and above)."
