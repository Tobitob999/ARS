The caster must remain stationary\nand concentrate on the subject for a full\nround. If the creature rolls a successful sav-\ning throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing\nabout that particular creature from the cast-\ning. Certain magical devices negate the\npower of the know alignment spell.\nThe reverse, undetectable alignment,\nconceals the alignment of an object or crea-\nture for 24 hours."
