Any touch attack spell of 4th\nlevel or less that is subsequently cast by the\nwizard can be delivered by the spectral\nhand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus\nto his attack roll. The caster cannot perfom\nany other actions when attacking with the\nhand; the hand returns to the caster and\nhovers if the caster takes other actions. ' !\nhand lasts the full spell duration unless ais-\nmissed by the caster, and it is possible to use\nmore than one touch attack with it. The\nhand receives flank and rear attack bonuses\nif the caster is in a position to do so. The\nhand is vulnerable to magical attack (but it\nhas an Armor Class of -2). Any damage to\nthe hand ends the spell and inflicts ld4\npoints of damage to the caster.\n."
