The wall of fog\nobscures all sight, normal and infravision,\nbeyond two feet. The caster may create less\nvapor if he wishes. The wall must be a\nroughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least\nten feet wide in its smallest dimension. The\nmisty vapors persist for three or more\nrounds. Their duration can be halved by a\nmoderate wind, and they can be blown\naway by a strong wind.\nThe material component is a pinch of split\ndried peas."
