Area 01 ~ect: The caster\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell can be cast in one of two\nforms: a warm shield that protects against\ncold-based attacks, or a chill shield that pro-\ntects against fire-based attacks. Both return\ndamage to creatures making physical\nattacks against the wizard. The wizard must\nchoose which variation he memorizes when\nthe spell is selected.\nWhen casting this spell, the wizard\nappears to immolate himself, but the flames\nare thin and wispy, shedding no heat,\nthough giving light equal to only half the\nillumination of a normal torch. The color of\nthe flames is determined randomly (50%\nchance of either color)-blue or green if the\nchill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm\nshield is employed. The special powers of\neach shield are as follows:\nA) Warm shield. The flames are warm to\nthe touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved\nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal\ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is\nno bonus against fire-based attacks, but if\nthe wizard fails to make the required saving\nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains\ndouble normal damage.\nThe material component for this varia-\ntion is a bit of phosphorus.\nB) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the\ntouch. Any fire-based attacks are saved\nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal\ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is\nno bonus against cold-based attacks, but if\nthe wizard fails to make the required saving\nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains\ndouble normal damage.\nThe material component for this varia-\ntion is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail\nportions of four dead ones.\nAny creature striking the spellcaster with\nits body or hand-held weapons inflicts nor-\nmal damage upon the wizard, but the\nattacker suffers the same amount of dam-\nage. An attacker‘s magical resistance, if any,\nis tested when the creature actually strikes\nthe wizard. Successful resistance shatters\nthe spell. Failure means the creature’s magic\nresistance does not affect that casting of the\nSpell."
