Note\nthat this does not affect either fuel consump-\ntion or damage caused by the fire. The\ncaster can affect any or all fires in the spell's\narea. He can alter their intensities with a sin-\ngle gesture as long as the spell is in effect.\nThe spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all\nfuel is burned, or the duration expires. The\ncaster can also extinguish all flames in the\narea, which expends the spell immediately.\nThe spell does not affect fire elementals or\nsimilar creatures."
