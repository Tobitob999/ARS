The creature\naffected is able to move vertically and hor-\nizontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascend-\ning, twice that if descending in a dive). The\nmaneuverability class of the creature is B.\nUsing the fly spell requires as much concen-\ntration as walking, so most spells can be cast\n1 49\nwhile hovering or moving slowly (move-\nment of 3). Possible combat penalties while\nflying are known to the DM (in the \"Aerial\nCombat\" section of the DMG). The exact\nduration of the spell is always unknown to\nthe spellcaster, as the variable addition 4\ndetermined secretly by the DM.\nThe material component of the fly spell is\na wing feather"
