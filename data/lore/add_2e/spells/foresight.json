When the\nwarnings are about him personally, the wiz-\nard cannot be surprised and always knows\nthe direction from which any attack on him\nis made. In addition, the spell gives the wiz-\nard a general idea of what action he might\ntake to best protect himself- duck, jump\nright, close his eyes, etc.-and gives him a\ndefensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class.\nWhen another is the object of the spell, the\nwizard receives warnings about that person.\nHe must still communicate this to the other\nto negate any surprise.
