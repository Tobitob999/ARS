It persists in this locale\nfor four rounds per caster level and reduces\nthe visibility ranges of all types of vision (in-\ncluding infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground\narea affected by the spell is a square progres-\nsion based on the caster‘s level: a 10’ x 10’\narea at 1st level, a 20’ x 20 ’ area at 2nd\nlevel, a 30’ x 30‘ area at 3rd level, and so on.\nThe height of the vapor is restricted to 10\nfeet, although the cloud will otherwise ex-\npand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind\n(such as the 3rd-level wizard spelI, gust of\nwind, can cut the duration of an obscure-\nment spell by 75%. This spell does not func-\ntion under water."
