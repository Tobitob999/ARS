    "raw_block": "Sticks to Snakes (Alteration)\nReversible\nSphere: Plant\nRange: 30 yards\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuratioh: 2 rounds/level\nCasting Time: 7\nArea of Effect: ld4 sticks + 1 stxk/~evd in a\nlo-foot cube\nSaving Throw: None\nBy means of this spell, the caster can\nchange ld4 sticks, plus one stick per ex@-\nence level, into snakes; thus a 9th-level\npriest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal\nnumber of snakes. These snakes attack\ncommanded by the priest. There must, of\ncourse, be sticks or similar pieces of wood\n(such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into\nsnakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a\nstaff. Sticks held by creatures are dowed a\nsaving throw equal to that of the pos%cssor\n(i.e., a spear held by an orc must fail the\norc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical\nitems, such as staves and enchanted spears,\nare not affected by the spell. Only sticks\nwithin the area of effect are changed. The\ntype of snake created varies, but a typical\nspecimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a\nmovement rate of 9, and either ccmshicts\nfor ld4 + 1 points of damage per round or\nbites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The\nchance of a snake thus changed being ven-\nomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcast-\ner desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a\nmaximum 55% chance that any snake cre-\nated by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts\nfor two rounds for each experience level of\nthe spellcaster.\nThematerial components of the spell are a\nsmall piece of bark and several snake&.\nThe reverse changes normal-sized snakes\nto sticks for the same duration, or it negates\nthe sticks to snakes spell according to the\nlevel of the priest countering the spell (e.g.,\na 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell\ncan turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks)."
