That is, the monster\nunderstands, in its own language or equiva-\nlent, the intent of what is said to it by the\npriest and vice versa. The creature thus spo-\nken to is checked by your DM in order to\ndetermine reaction. All creatures of the\nsame type as that chosen by the priest can\nlikewise understand if they are within\nrange. The priest can speak to different\ntypes of creatures during the spell duration,\nbut he must speak separately to each type.\nThe spell lasts for two rounds per caster\nlevel."
