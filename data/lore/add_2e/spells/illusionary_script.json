Only the person (or people)\nwho the wizard desires to read the writing\ncan do so. An illusionist recognizes it for il-\nlusionary script.\nUnauthorized creatures glancing at the\nscript must roll saving throws vs. spell. A\nsuccessful save means the creature can look\naway with only a mild sense of disorienta-\ntion. Failure means the creature is subject to\na suggestion implanted in the script by the\ncaster at the time the illusionary script was\ncast. The suggestion cannot require more\nthan three turns to carry out. The sugges-\ntion could be to close the book and leave, or\nto forget the existence of the book, for ex-\nample. A successful dispel magic spell will\nremove the illusionary script, but an unsuc-\ncessful attempt erases all of the writing. The\nhidden writings can be read by a combina-\ntion of the true seeing spell and either the\nread magic or comprehend languages spell,\nas applicable.\nThe material component is a lead-based\nink that requires special manufacture by an\nalchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp\nper usage."
