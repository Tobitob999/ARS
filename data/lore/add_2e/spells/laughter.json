Although\nthis magical mirth lasts only a single round,\nthe affected creature must spend the next\nround regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points\nfrom its Strength (or -2 to attack and dam-\nage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the\nspell.\nThe saving throw vs. spell is modified by\nthe Intelhgence of the creature. Creatures\nwith Intelligences of 4 or less (semi-\nintelligent) are totally unaffected. Those\nwith Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with -6\npenalties. Those with Intelligences of 8-12\n(average to very) save with -4 penalties.\nThose with Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save\nwith -2 penalties. Those with Intelligences\nof 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodi-\nfied saving throws.\nThe caster can affect one creature for ev-\nery three levels attained-e.g., one at 3rd\nlevel, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc.\nAll affected beings must be within 30 feet of\neach other.\nThe material components are a small\nfeather and minute tarts. The tarts are\nhurled at the subjects, while the feather is\nwaved in one hand."
