The\npriest can divide the base duration between\nmultiple characters. Thus an 8th-level priest\ncan confer this ability to two characters for\nfour hours, four for two hours, eight for one\nhour, etc., to a minimum of 1/2 hour per\ncharacter.\nThe reverse, air breathing, enables water-\nbreathing creatures to survive comfortably\nin the atmosphere for an equal duration.\nNote that neither version prevents the recip-\nient creature from breathing in its natural\nelement."
