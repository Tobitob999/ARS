Any\ncreature caught within the cloud must roll a\nsuccessful saving throw vs. poison or be\nreeling and unable to attack because of MU-\nsea, for ld4 + 1 rounds after leaving the\ncloud.

These poisonous effects can be\nslowed or neutralized by appropriate\nmagic. The cloud duration is halved in a\nmoderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h) and is dis-\npersed in one round by a stronger breeze.\nThe material component of the spell is a\nrotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves.\nI\nI\n1\nI\n145"
