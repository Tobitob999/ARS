If the form has gills, the caster can\nbreathe underwater as long as the spell lasts.\nHowever, any multiple attack routines or\nadditional damage allowed to an assumed\nform are not gained by the caster.\nThe caster’s attack rolls, Annor Class,\nand saving throws do not-change. The spell\ndoes not confer special abilities, attack\nforms, or defenses. Once the new form is\nchosen, it remains for the duration of the\nspell. The caster can change back into his\nown form at will; this ends the spell immedi-\nately. A caster who is slain automatically\nreturns to his normal form."
