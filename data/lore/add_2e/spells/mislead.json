The wizard is then free to go\nelsewhere while his double seemingly moves\naway. The spell enables the illusion of the\nwizard to speak and gesture as if it were\nreal, and there are full olfactory and touch\ncomponents as well. A tnre seeing spell or a\ngem of seeing will reveal the illusion for\nwhat it is.
