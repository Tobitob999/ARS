The following are typical:\n1. Courage: This emotion causes the\ncreatures affected to become berserk, fight-\ning with a + 1 bonus to the attack dice, caw\ning +3 points of damage, and temporarily\ngaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight\nwithout shield, and regardless of life, never I\n1\nchecking morale. This spell counters (and is\ncountered by) fear.\n2. FeaT: The affected creatures flee in\npanic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is\ncountered by) couruge.\n3. Friendship: The affected creatures\nreact more positively (e.g., tolerance\nbecomes goodwill). It counters (and is coun-\ntered by) hate.\n4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and\na feeling of complacent well-being, adding\n+4 to all reaction rolls and making attack\nunlikely unless the creatures are subject to\nextreme provocation. It counters (and is\ncountered by) sadness.\n5. Hate: The affected creatures react\nmore negatively (e.g., tolerance becomes\nnegative neutrality). It counters (and is\ncountered by) friendship.\n6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise\nmorale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and\ndamage caused by +2. It counters (and is\ncountered by) hopelessness.\n7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures\nsubmit to the demands of any opponent:\nsurrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the crea-\ntures are 25% likely to do nothing in a\nround, and 25% likely to turn back or\nretreat. It counters (and is countered by)\nhope.\n8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and\na tendency toward maudlin introspection.\nThis emotion increases chances of being sur-\nprised by - 1 and adds + 1 to initiative rolls.\nIt counters (and is countered by) happiness.\nAll creatures in the area at the instant the\nspell is cast are affected unless successful\nsaving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted\nfor Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the\nwizard continues to concentrate on project-\ning the chosen emotion. Those who fail the\nsaving throw against fear must roll a new\nsaving throw if they return to the affected\narea."
