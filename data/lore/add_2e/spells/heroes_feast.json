The spell\ncreates a magnificent table, chairs, service,\nand all the necessary food and drink. The\nfeast takes one full hour to consume, and\nthe beneficial effects do not set in until after\nthis hour is over. Those partaking of the\nfeast are cured of all diseases, are immune to\npoison for l2 hours, and are healed of\nld4 + 4 points of damage after imbibing the\nnectar-like beverage that is part of the feast.\nThe ambrosia-like food that is consumed is\nequal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours.\nAlso, during this same period, the people\nwho consumed the feast are immune to fear,\nhopelessness, and panic. If the feast is inter-\nrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined\nand all effects of the spell are negated.\nThe material components of the spell are\nthe priest's holy symbol and specially fer-\nmented honey taken from the cells of bee\nlarvae destined for royal status.\ntment)\nSphere: Plant\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: 1 day/level\nCasting Time: 1 turn\nArea of Effect: 1 oak tree\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell enables the caster to charm a\nhealthy oak tree (or'other type if the DM\nallows) to cause it to serve as a protector.\nThe spell can be cast on a single tree at a\ntime. While a liveoak spell cast by a particu-\nlar caster is in effect, he cannot cast another\nsuch spell. The tree upon which the spell is\ncast must be within 10 feet of the caster's\ndwelling place, within a place sacred to the\ncaster, or within 100 yards of something\nthat the caster wishes to guard or protect.\nThe liveoak spell can be cast upon a\nhealthy tree of small, medium, or large size,\naccording to desire and availability, A trig-\ngering phrase of up to a maximum of one\nword per level of the spellcaster is then\nplaced upon the targeted oak; for instance,\n\"Attack any persons who come near with-\nout first saying 'sacred mistletoe' '' is an 11-\nword trigger phrase that could be used by a\ncaster of 11th level or higher casting the\nspell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into\nanimating as a treant of equivalmt size, an\nArmor Class of 0 and with two attacks per\nround, but with only a %foot-per-round\nmovement rate.\nDamage\nPer\nTreeSize Height HitDice Attack\nSmall 12'-14' 7-8 2d8\nMedium 16'-19' 9-10 3d6\nLarge 20'-23'+ 11-12 4d6\nA tree enchanted by this spell radiates a\nmagical aura (if checked for), and can be\nreturned to normal by a successful casting\nof a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of\nthe caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the\ntree takes root immediately. If released by\nthe caster, it tries to return to its original\nlocation before taking root. Damage to the\ntree can be healed with a plant growth spell,\nwhich restores 3d4 points of damage. A\nplant growth spell used in this fashion does\nnot increase the size or hit points of the\nliveoak beyond the original value.\nThe caster needs his holy symbol to cast\nthis spell.\n228"
