    "raw_block": "Wall of Ice (Evocation)\nRange: 10 yards/level\nComponents: V, S, M\nDuration: 1 turdlevel\nCasting Time: 4\nArea of Effect: Special\nSaving Throw: None\nThis spell can be cast in one of three\nways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a\nhemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall\nupon creatures with the effect of an ice\nstorm.\nA) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a\nsheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall\nis primarily defensive, stopping pursuers\nand the like. The wall is one inch thick per\nlevel of experience of the wizard. It covers a\n10-foot-square area per level (a loth-level\nwizard can create a wall of ice up to 100 feet\nlong and 10 feet high or 50 feet long and 20\nfeet high, etc.). Any creature breaking\nthrough the ice suffers 2 points of damage\nper inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using\ncreatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch,\nwhile cold-using creatures suffer only 1\npoint of damage per inch when breaking\nthrough. The plane can be oriented in any\nfashion as long as it is anchored aIong one or\nmore sides.\nB) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell\ncreates a hemisphere whose maximum radi-\nus is equal to three feet plus one foot per\ncaster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can cre-\nate a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemi-\nsphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or\nmelted. Note that it is possible, but difficult,\nto trap mobile opponents under the hemi-\nsphere.\nC) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell\ncauses a horizontal sheet to fall upon oppo-\nnents. The sheet covers a Wfoot-square\narea per caster level. The sheet has the same\neffect as an jce storm's hail stones--3dlO\n%\nA wall of ice cannot form in an ivea occu-\npied by physical objects or creatures; its sur-\nface must be smooth and unbroken when\ncreated. Magical fires such as fireballs and\nfiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one\nround, though this creates a great cloud of\nsteamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires\nor lesser magical ones do not hasten the\nmelting of a wall of ice.\nThe material component of this spell is a\nsmall piece of quartz or similar rock crystal."
