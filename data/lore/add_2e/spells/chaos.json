Those allowed sav-\ning throws roll them vs. spell with -2 pen-\nalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who\nsuccessfully save are unaffected by the spell.\nAffected creatures react as follows:\nDIORoll Action\n1 Wander away (unless prevented)\nfor duration of spell\n2-6 Stand confused one round\n(then roll again)\n1-3 Attack nearest creature for one\nround (then roll again)\n10 Act normally for one round\n(then roll again)\nThe spell lasts one round for each level of\nthe caster. Those affected are checked by the\nDM for actions each round for the duration\nof the spell, or until the \"wander away for\nthe duration of the spell\" result occurs.\nWandering creatures move as far from the\ncaster as possible using their most typical\nmode of movement (characters walk, fish\nswim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and\nactions are checked at the beginning of each\nround. Any confused creature that is\nattacked perceives the attacker as an enemy\nand acts according to its basic nature.\nThe material component for this spell is a\nsmall disc of bronze and a small rod of iron."
