Note \nthat this does not affect either fuel consump- \ntion or damage caused by the fire. The \ncaster can affect any or all fires in the spell's \narea. He can alter their intensities with a sin- \ngle gesture as long as the spell is in effect. \nThe spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all \nfuel is burned, or the duration expires. The \ncaster can also extinguish all flames in the \narea, which expends the spell immediately. \nThe spell does not affect fire elementals or \nsimilar creatures. \nAlarm (Abjuration, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours + V2 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Up to a 2Gfoot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an alarm spell is cast, the wizard \ncauses a selected area to react to the pres- \nence of any creature larger than a normal \nrat-anything larger than about one-half \ncubic foot in volume or more than about \nthree pounds in weight. The area of effect \ncan be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. \nAs soon as any creature enters the warded \narea, touches it, or otherwise contacts it \nwithout speaking a password established by \nthe caster, the ah spell lets out a loud \nringing that can be heard clearly within a \nafoot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet \nfor each interposing door and by 20 feet for \neach substantial interposing wall.) The \nsound lasts for one round and then ceases. \nEthereal or astrally projected creatures do \nnot trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating \ncreatures, invisible creatures, or incorpor- \neal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can \ndismiss the alarm with a single word. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver \n- endix 3: Wizard Spells \nArmor (Conjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \na magical field of force that serves as if it \nwere scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has \nno effect on a person already armored or a \ncreature with Annor Class 6 or better. It is \nnot cumulative with the shield spell, but it is \ncumulative with Dexterity and, in the case \nof fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. \nThe armor spell does not hinder movement, \nadds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it \nprevent spellcasting. It lasts until success- \nfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains \ncumulative damage totaling greater than 8 \npoints +1 per level of the caster. (It is im- \nportant to note that the armor does not ab- \nsorb this damage. The armor merely grants \nan AC of 6: the wearer still suffers full dam- \nage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the \nwearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, \nthen several minutes later sustain an addi- \ntional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell \nwere cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, \nit would be dispelled at this time. Until it is \ndispelled, the amor spell grants the wearer \nfull benefits of the Armor Class gained. \nThe material component is a piece of \nfinely cured leather that has been blessed by \na priest. \nAudible Glamer (Illusion/Ph \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 roundsllevel \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Hearing range \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen the audibleglamer spell is cast, \nwizard causes a volume of sound to arise, \nat whatever distance he desires (within \nrange), and seem to recede, approach, or \nremain at a fixed place as desired. The vol- \nume of sound created, however, is directly \nrelated to the level of the spellcaster. The \nvolume is based upon the lowest level at \nwhich the spell can be cast, 1st level. The \nnoise of the audible glamer at this level is \nthat of four men, maximum. Each addi- \ntional experience level of the wizard adds a \nlike volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard \ncan have the spell cause sound equal to that \nof eight men. Thus, talking, singing, \nshouting, walking, marching, or running \nsounds can be created. The auditory illu- \nsion created by an audible glamer spell can \nbe virtually any type of sound, but the rel- \native volume must be commensurate with \nthe level of the wizard casting the spell. A \nhorde of rats running and squeaking is \nabout the same volume as eight men run- \nning and shouting. A roaring lion is equal \nto the noise volume of 16 men, while a \nroaring dragon is equal to the noise volume \nof no fewer than 24 men. \nA character stating that he does not be- \nlieve the sound receives a saving throw, and \nif it succeeds, the character then hears a \nfaint and obviously false sound, emanating \nfrom the caster's direction. Note that this \nspell can enhance the effectiveness of the \nphantusmal force spell. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of wool or a small lump of wax. \nI \nBurning Hands (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: 112 \nWhen the wizard casts this spell, a jet of \nsearing flame shoots from his fingertips. His \nhands must be held so as to send forth a fan- \nlike sheet of flames: the wizards thumbs \nmust touch each other and fingers must be \nspread. The burning hands send out flame \njets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of \nabout 120 degrees in front of the wizard. \nAny creature in the area of the flames suf- \nfers ld3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points \nfor each level of experience of the spell- \ncaster, to a maximum of Id3 + 20 points of \nfire damage. Those successfully saving vs. \nspell receive half damage. Flammable mate- \nrials touched by the fire bum (e.g., cloth, \npaper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such \nmaterials can be extinguished in the next \nround if no other action is taken. \nCantrip (All Schools) \nRange: 10 feet \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nCantrips are minor spells I idied by I \nards during their apprenticeship, regard \nof school. The cantrip spell is a practice \nmethod for the apprentice, teaching him \nhow to tap minute amounts of m+ \nenergy. Once cast, the canttip spell enables \nthe caster to create minor magical effects for \nthe duration of the spell. So minor are these \neffects that they have severe limitations. \nThey are completely unable to cause a loss \nof hit points, cannot affect the concentra- \ntion of spellcasters, and can only create \nsmall, obviously magical materials. Fur- \nthermore, materials created by a cantrip are \nextremely fragile and cannot be used --\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 132 | PDF_PAGE 133]\nWizard Snells (1st Level) \ntools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks th \npower to duplicate any other spell effects. \nWhatever manifestation the cantril \ntakes, it remains in effect only as long as th \nwizard concentrates. Wizards typically us \ncantrips to impress common folk, amus \nchildren, and brighten dreary lives. Com \nmon tricks with cantrips include tinklings o \nethereal music, brightening faded flowers \nglowing balls that float over the caster’ \nhand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spic \ning up aromas and flavors of bland food \nand little whirlwinds to sweep dust undei \nrugs. Combined with the unseen servan \nspell, these are the tools to make housekeep \ning and entertaining simpler for the wizard \nChange Self (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2d6 rounds + 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nving Throw: None \ns spell enables the wizard to alter the \nrance of his form-including clothing \nand equipment-to appear one foot shorter \nor taller; thin, fat, or in between; human, \nhumanoid, or any other generally man- \nshaped bipedal creature. The caster cannot \nduplicate a specific individual. The spell \ndoes not provide the abilities or mannerisms \nof the chosen form. The duration of the spell \nis 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds \nper level of experience of the spellcaster. The \nDM may allow a saving throw for disbelief \nunder certain circumstances: for example, \nif the caster acts in a manner obviously \ninconsistent with his chosen role. The spell \ndoes not alter the perceived tactile (i.e., \nment, and the rus \n’ Range: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 person \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell affects any single person it is \ncast upon. The term person includes any \nbipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid \nof man-size or smaller, such as brownies, \ndryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, \ngoblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, \nhobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, \nnixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and \nothers. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be \ncharmed, but an ogre could not. \nThe person receives a saving throw vs. \nspell to avoid the effect, with any adjust- \nment due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the \nperson receives damage from the caster \ngroup in the same round the charm is cas \nan additional bonus of +1 per hit point c \ndamage received is added to the victim \nsaving throw. \nIf the spell recipient fails his savin \nthrow, he regards the caster as a truste \nfriend and ally to be heeded and protectec \nThe spell does not enable the caster to con \ntrol the charmed creature as if it were a \nautomaton, but any word or action of th \ncaster is viewed in the most favorable wa) \nThus, a charmed person would not obey \nsuicide command, but he might believe th \ncaster if assured that the only chance to sav~ \nthe caster‘s life is for the person to hold bacl \nan onrushing red dragon for “just a round o \ntwo.” Note also that the spell does no \nendow the caster with linguistic capabilitie: \nbeyond those he normally possesses (i.e., hc \nmust speak the victim’s language to commu \nnicate his commands). \nThe duration of the spell is a function 01 \nthe charmed person’s Intelligence and is tiec \nto the saving throw. The spell may be bro- \nken if a successful saving throw is rolled, \nand this saving throw is checked on a peri- \nodic basis, according to the creature’s Intel- \nligence (see the following table). If the caster \nharms, or attempts to harm, the charmed \nperson by some overt action, or if a dispel \nmagic spell is successfully cast upon the \ncharmed person, the charm spell is broken. \nIf two or more charm effects simultane- \nously affect a creature, the result is decided \nby the DM. This could range from one effect \nbeing clearly dominant, to the subject being \ntom by conflicting desires, to new saving \nthrows that could negate both spells. \nNote that the subject has full memory of \n:he events that took place while he was \n:harmed. \nIntelligence Score Time Between Checks \n3 or less 3 months \n2 months 4 to 6 \n7 to 9 1 month \n10 to 12 3 weeks \n13 to 14 2 weeks \n15 to 16 1 week \n17 3 days \n18 2 days \n19 or more 1 day \nNote: The period between checks is the \n[me period during which the check occurs. \nVhen to roll the check during this time is \netermined (randomly or by selection) by \nle DM. The roll is made secretly. \nChill Touch Ovecromancy) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen the caster completes this spell, a \nblue glow encompasses his hand. This \nenergy attacks the life force of any living \ncreature upon which the wizard makes a \nsuccessful melee attack. The touched ma- \nture must roll a successful saving throw vs. \nspell or suffer ld4 points of damage and lose \n1 point of Strength. If the save is successful, \nthe creature remains unharmed. Creatures \nnot rated for Strength suffer a - 1 penalty to \ntheir attack rolls for every other successful \ntouch. Lost Strength returns at the rate of 1 \npoint per hour. Damage must be cured mag- \nically or healed naturally. \nThis spell has a special effect on undead \ncreatures. Undead touched by the caster suf- \nfer no damage or Strength loss, but they \nmust successfully save vs. spell or flee for \nld4 rounds + 1 round per level of the caster. \nColor Spray (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 5’ x 20’ x 20’ wedge \nSaving Throw: Special \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard causes \na vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors \no spring forth from his hand. From one to \n;ix creatures (ld6) within the area are affect- \n!d in order of increasing distance from the \nvizard. All creatures above the level of the \npellcaster and all those of 6th level or 6 Hit \nlice or more are entitled to a saving throw \n‘s. spell. Blind or unseeing creatures are not \nlffected by the spell. \nCreatures not allowed or failing saving \nhrows, and whose Hit Dice or levels are less \nhan or equal to the spellcaster’s level, are \ntruck unconscious for 2d4 rounds; those \nrith Hit Dice or levels 1 or 2 greater than \nbe wizard’s level are blinded for ld4 \nmnds; those with Hit Dice or levels 3 or \nmore greater than that of the spellcaster are \nstunned (reeling and unable to think or act \ncoherently) for one round. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pinch each of powder or sand that is col- \nored red, yellow, and blue. \n132\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 133 | PDF_PAGE 134]\n4 \nWizard Spells (1 st Level) \nComprehend Languages (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 speaking creature or \nwritten object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto understand the spoken words of a crea- \nture or read an otherwise incomprehensible \nwritten message (such as writing in another \nlanguage). In either case, the wizard must \ntouch the creature or the writing. Note that \nthe ability to read does not necessarily \nimpart understanding of the material, nor \ndoes the spell enable the caster to speak or \nwrite an unknown language. Written mate- \nrial can be read at the rate of one page or \nequivalent per round. Magical writing can- \nnot be read, other than to know it is magi- \ncal, but the spell is often useful when \ndeciphering treasure maps. This spell can be \nfoiled by certain warding magics (the 3rd- \nlevel secret page and illusionary script \nspells) and it does not reveal messages con- \ncealed in otherwise normal text. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pinch of soot and a few grains of salt. \nThe reverse of this spell, confuse languag- \nes, cancels a comprehend languages spell or \nrenders a writing or a creature's speech \nincomprehensible, for the same duration as \nabove. \ncing L; : Uteration) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/le \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a dancing lights spell is cast, the \nwizard creates, at his option, from one to \nfour lights that resemble either torches or \nlanterns (and cast that amount of light), \nglowing spheres of light (such as evidenced \nby willswisps), or one faintly glowing, \nvaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar \nto that of a creature from the elemental \nplane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the \nspellcaster desires, forward or back, \nstraight or turning comers, without concen- \ntration upon such movement by the wizard. \nThe spell cannot be used to cause blindness \n(see 1st-level light spell), and it winks out if \nthe range or duration is exceeded. \nThe material component of this spell is \neither a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or \na glowworm. \nDetect Magic (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10' path, 60' long \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the detect magic spell is cast, the \nwizard detects magical radiations in a path \n10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the \ndirection he is facing. The intensity of the \nmagic can be determined (dim, faint, mod- \nerate, strong, overwhelming), and the wiz- \nard has a 10% chance per level to recognize \nif a certain type of magic (alteration, conju- \nration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn, \nscanning a &degree arc per round. A stone \nwall of one foot or more thickness, solid \nmetal of one inch thickness, or a yard or \nmore of solid wood blocks the spell. Magi- \ncal areas, multiple types of magic, or strong \nlocal magical emanations may confuse or \nconceal weaker radiations. Note that this \nspell does not reveal the presence of good or \nevil, or reveal alignment. Other-planar \ncreatures are not neiessarily m 'tal: \nArea of Effect: 60' + 10'/level 1 \nDetect Undead \n(Divination, Necromancy) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 turns \nCasting Time: 1 round \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to detect all \nundead creatures out to the range of the \nspell. The area of effect extends in a path 10 \nfeet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet long- \ner per level of the wizard), in the direction \nthe caster is facing. Scanning a direction \nrequires one round, and the caster must be \nmotionless. While the spell indicates direc- \ntion, it does not give specific location or dis- \ntance. It detects undead through walls and \nobstacles but is blocked by one foot of solid \nstone, one yard of wood or loose earth, or a \nthin coating of metal. The spell does not \nindicate the type of undead detected, only \nthat undead are present. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nbit of earth from a grave. \nI \nMuge (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell causes instant growth of a crea- \nture or object, increasing both size and \nweight. It can be cast only upon a slngle \ncreature (or a symbiotic or community enti- \nty) or upon a single object that does not \nexceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster \nlevel. The object or creature must be seen to \nbe affected. It grows by up to 10% per level \nof experience of the wizard, increasing this \namount in height, width, and weight. \nAll equipment worn or carried by a crea- \nture is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling vic- \ntims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. \nA successful saving throw means the spell \nfails. If insufficient room is available for the \ndesired growth, the creature or object \nattains the maximum possible size, bursting \nweak enclosures in the process, but it is con- \nstrained without harm by stronger \nmaterials-the spell cannot be used to crush \na creature by growth. \nMagical properties are not increased by \nthis spell-a huge sword + 1 is still only + 1, \na staff-sized wand is still only capable of its \nnormal functions, a giant-sized potion \nmerely requires a greater fluid intake to \nmake its magical effects operate, etc. \nWeight, mass, and strength are affected, \nthough. Thus, a table blocking a door \nwould be heavier and more effective, a \nhurled stone would have more mass (and \ncause more damage), chains would be more \nmassive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to \na sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A crea- \nture's hit points, Armor Class, and attack \nrolls do not change, but damage rolls \nincrease proportionately with size. For \nexample, a fighter at 160% normal size hits \nwith his long sword and rolls a 6 for dam- \nage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, \n6 x 1.6 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to \nStrength; class, and magic are not altered. \nThe reverse spell, reduce, negates the \nenlarge spell or makes creatures or objects \nsmaller. The creature or object loses 10% of \nits original size for every level of the caster, \nto a minimum of 10% of the original size. \nThereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot \nincrements to less than one foot, by one- \ninch increments to one inch, and by ~10- \ninch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an \ninch-the recipient cannot dwindle away to \nnothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall \ngiant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 \nsteps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine \nsteps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in \none step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the \n133\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 134 | PDF_PAGE 135]\nlast five steps). A shrinking object mal \ndamage weaker materials affixed to it, bui \nan object will shrink only as long as the ob. \nject itself is not damaged. Unwilling crea- \ntures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. \nThe material component of this spell is a \npinch of powdered iron. \nErase (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 scroll or 2 pages \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe erase spell removes writings of either \nmagical or mundane nature from a scroll or \nfrom one to two pages of paper, parchment, \nor similar surfaces. It removes explosive \nrunes, glyphs of warding, sepia snake sigik, \nand wizard marks, but it does not remove iJ- \nJusory script or symbols (see these spells). \nNonmagical writings are automatically \nerased if the caster is touching them, other- \nwise the chance for success is 90%. Magical \nwritings must be touched, and are only 30% \nlikely to be erased, plus 5 % per caster level, \nto a maximum of 90% (e.g., 35% for a 1st- \nlevel caster, 40% for a 2nd-level caster, \netc.). \n. \nFeather Fall (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the creature(s) or \nobject(s) affected immediately assumes the \nmass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is in- \nstantly changed to a mere two feet per sec- \nond (120 feet per round), and no damage is \nincurred upon landing while the spell is in \neffect. However, when the spell duration \nceases, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell \ncan be cast upon the wizard or some other \ncreature or object up to the maximum range \nand lasts for one round for each level of the \nwizard. The feather fall affects one or more \nobjects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as \nlong as the maximum weight of the crea- \ntures or objects does not exceed a combined \ntotal of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per \nlevel of the spellcaster. \nFor example, a 2nd-level wizard has a \nrange of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, \nand a weight limit of 600 pounds when cast- \ning this spell. The spell works only upon \nfree-falling, flying, or propelled objects \n(such as missiles). It does not affect a sword \nblow or a charging creature. Note that the \nspell can be effectively combined with gust \nof wind and similar spells. \nFind Familiar (Conjuratiotr/Sumrnoning) \nRange: 1 mile/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2d12 hours \nArea of Effect: 1 familiar \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the caster to attempt to \nsummon a familiar to act as his aide and \ncompanion. Familiars are typically small \ncreatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, \nhawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, wea- \nsels, or even mice. A creature acting as a fa- \nmiliar can benefit a wizard, conveying its \nsensory powers to its master, conversing \nwith him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy \nas well. A wizard can have only one familiar \nat a time, however, and he has no control \nover what sort of creature answers the sum- \nmoning, if any at all come. \nThe creature is always more intelligent \nthan others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int \npoints), and its bond with the wizard con- \nfers upon it an exceptionally long life. The \nwizard receives the heightened senses of his \nfamiliar, which grants the wizard a +1 bo- \nnus to all surprise die rolls. Normal famil- \niars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per \ncaster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to \nsize, speed, etc.). \nThe wizard has an empathic link with the \nfamiliar and can issue it mental commands \nat a distance of up to one mile. Note that \nempathic responses from the familiar are \ngenerally fairly basic-while able to com- \nmunicate simple thoughts, these are often \noverwhelmed by instinctual responses. \nThus a ferret familiar spying on a band of \norcs in the woods might lose its train of \nthought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly \nits communications to its master would be \ntinged with fear of the “big ones” it was spy- \ning on! The caster cannot see through the fa- \nmiliar’s eyes. \nIf separated from the caster, the familiar \nloses 1 hit point each day, and dies if re- \nduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in \nphysical contact with its wizard, it gains the \nwizards saving throws against special at- \nbacks. If a special attack would normally \n:ause damage, the familiar suffers no dam- \nage if the saving throw is successful and half \nlamage if the saving throw is failed. If the \n:amiliar dies, the wizard must successfully \n-011 an immediate system shock check or \niie. Even if he survives this check, the wiz- \nird loses 1 point from his Constitution \nvhen the familiar dies. \nThe power of the conjuration is such that \nt can be attempted but once per year. When \nhe wizard decides to find a familiar, he \nnust load a brass brazier with charcoal. \nVhen this is burning well, he adds 1,ooO g~ \nworth of incense and herbs. The spell incan- \nation is then begun and must be continued \n134 \nuntil the familiar comes or the casting time \nis finished. The DM secretly determines all \nresults. Note that most familiars are not in- \nherently magical, nor does a dispel magic \nspell send them away. \nDeliberate mistreatment, failure to feed \nand care for the familiar, or continuous un- \nreasonable demands have adverse effects on \nthe familiar’s relationship with its master. \nPurposely arranging the death of one‘s own \nfamiliar incurs great disfavor from certain \npowerful entities, with dire results. \nRoll Familiar * Sensory Powers \n1-5 Cat, black Excellent night vision & \nsuperior hearing \n6-7 Crow Excellent vision \n8-9 Hawk Very superior distance \nvision \n10-11 owl Night vision equals hu- \nman daylight vision, su- \nperior hearing \nSuperior hearing & very \nsuperior olfactory power \nD20 \n12-13 Toad Wide-angle vision \n14-15 Weasel \n16-20 No familiar available within \n* The referee can substitute other small anl- \nmals suitable to the area. \nspell range \nFriends (EnchantmenvCharm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nA friends spell causes the wizard to tem- \nporarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma. Intel- \nligent creatures within the area of effect at \nthe time the spell is cast must make immedi- \nate reaction checks based on the character’s \nnew Charisma. Those with favorable reac- \ntions tend to be very impressed with the \nspellcaster and make an effort to be his \nFriends and help him, as appropriate to the \nsituation. Officious bureaucrats might de- \n:ide to become helpful; surly gate guards \nmight wax informative; attacking orcs \nnight spare the caster’s life, taking him cap- \nive instead. When the spell wears off, the \n:reatures realize that they have been influ- \nmced, and their reactions are determined by \nhe DM. \nThe components for this spell are chalk \nor white flour), lampblack (or soot), and \nrermilion applied to the face before casting \nhe spell.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 135 | PDF_PAGE 136]\ns \nCue Reflectlon (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe gaze reflection spell creates a shim- \nmering, mirror-like area of air before the \nwizard that moves with the caster. Any gaze \nattack, such as that of a basilisk, eyes of \ncharming, a vampire's gaze, the 6th-level \neyebite spell, and so on, is reflected back \nupon the gazer if the gazer tries to make eye \ncontact with the spellcaster (the spellcaster \nsuffers no effects from the gaze attack). \nSuch creatures receive a saving throw vs. \ntheir own gaze effect. The spell does not \naffect vision or lighting and is not effective \nagainst creatures whose effect comes from \nbeing gazed upon (such as a medusa). Only \nactive gaze attacks are blocked by this spell. \nCrease (Conjuration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10' x 10' square area \nSaving Throw: Special \nA grease spell covers a material surface \nwith a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy \nnature. Any creature entering the area or \ncaught in it when the spell is cast must save \nvs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who \nsuccessfully save can reach the nearest non- \ngreased surface by the end of the round. \nThose who remain in the area are allowed a \nsaving throw each round until they escape \nthe area. The DM should adjust saving \nthrows by circumstance; for example, a \ncreature charging down an incline that is \nsuddenly greased has little chance to avoid \nthe effect, but its ability to exit the affected \narea is almost assuredl The spell can also be \nused to create a greasy coating on an item- \na rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. \nMaterial objects not in use are always \naffected by this spell, while creatures wield- \ning or employing items receive a saving \nthrow vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the ini- \ntial saving throw is failed, the creature \nimmediately drops the item. A saving throw \nmust be made each round the creature \nattempts to use the greased item. The caster \ncan end the effect with a single utterance; \notherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one \nround per level. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of pork rind or butter. \nWizard Spells (1 st Level) \nHold Portal (Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponent: V \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20 square feetllevel \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell magically bars a door, gate, or \nvalve of wood, metal, or stone. The magical \nclosure holds the portal fast, just as if it were \nsecurely closed and locked. Any extra- \nplanar creature (djinn, elemental, etc.) with \n4 or more Hit Dice can shatter the spell and \nburst open the portal. A wizard of 4 or more \nexperience levels higher than the spellcaster \ncan open the held portal at will. A knock \nspell or a successful dispel magic spell can \nnegate the hold portal. Held portals can be \nbroken or physically battered down. \nHypnotism (EnchantmentKhann) \nRange: 5 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe gestures of the wizard, along with his \ndroning incantation, cause ld6 creatures \nwithin the area to become susceptible to a \nsuggestion-a brief and reasonable- \nsounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard \nsuggestion spell). The request must be given \nafter the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that \ntime the success of the spell is unknown. \nNote that the subsequent suggestion is not a \nspell, but simply a vocalized urging (the \ncaster must speak a language the creature \nunderstands for this spell to work). Crea- \ntures that successfully roll their saving \nthrows are not under hypnotic influence. \nThose who are exceptionally wary or hostile \nsave with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is \ncast afan individual creature that meets the \ncaster's gaze, the saving throw is made with \na penalty of -2. A creature that fails its sav- \ning throw does not remember that the caster \nenspelled it. \nIdentify (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 item/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an identify spell is cast, magical \nitems subsequently touched by the wizard \ncan be identified. The eight hours immedi- \nately precedii the casting of the spell must \nbe spent purify@ the items and I*emoving \ninfluences that would corrupt and blur their \nmagical auras. If this period is interrupted, \nit must be begun again. When the spell is \ncast, each item must be handled in turn by \nthe wizard. Any consequences of this han- \ndling fall fully upon the wizard and may end \nthe spell, although the wizard is allowed \nany applicable saving throw. \ncovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wiz- \nard could attempt to determine the nature of \nfive different items, five different functions \nof a single item, or any combination of \ntwo). If any attempt at readipg fails, \ncaster cannot learn any more about that \nitem until he advances a level. Note that \nsome items, such as special magical tomes, \ncannot be identified with this spell. \nThe item never reveals its exact attack or \ndamage bonuses, although the fact that it has \nfew or many bonuses canbe determined. If it \nhascharges,onlyageneralindicationdthe \n.' \nuntil full Constitution is restored, \ntakes 24 hours (one point per three hours f \nan unconscious character). \nThe material components of this spell are \na pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl \nfeather steeped in wine, with the infusion \ndrunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is \npowdered and added to the infusion, the \ndivination becomes much more potent: \nexact bonuses or charges can be determined, \nand the functions of a multi-functional item \ncan be learned from a single reading. At the \nDMs option, certain properties of an arti- \nfact or relic might also be learned. \nJump (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Id3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe individual touched when this spell is I cast is empowered to leap once per round \nfor the e swll. Leaps can be up\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 136 | PDF_PAGE 137]\nWizard Spells (1 st Level) \nto 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 \nfeet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or \nbackward have only a slight arc-about \ntwo feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The \njump spell does not ensure safety in landing \nor grasping at the end of the leap. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ngrasshopper’s hind leg, to be broken by the \ncaster when the spell is cast. \nLight (Alteration) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a luminous glow, equal \nto torchlight, within a fixed radius of the \nspell’s center. Objects in darkness beyond \nthis sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and \nshadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a \npoint selected by the caster, and he must \nhave a line of sight and unobstructed path \nfor the spell when it is cast. Light can spring \nfrom air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any \nsimilar substance. \nThe effect is immobile unless it is specifi- \ncally centered on a moveable object or \nmobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a \ncreature, the applicable magic resistance \nand saving throw rolls must be made. Suc- \ncessful resistance negates the spell, while a \nsuccessful saving throw indicates that the \nspell is centered immediately behind the \ncreature, rather than upon the creature \nitself. Light taken into an area of magical \ndarkness does not function, but if cast \ndirectly against magical darkness negates it \n(but only for the duration of the light spell, \nif the darkness effect is continual). \nLight centered on the visual organs of a \ncreature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls \nand saving throws by 4 and worsening its \nArmor Class by 4. The caster can end the \nspell at any time by uttering a single word. \nThe material component is a firefly or a \npiece of phosphorescent moss. \nMasic Missile (Evocation) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures \nSaving Throw: None __ \nUse of the magic missile spell creates up to \nfive missiles of magical energy that dart \nforth from the wizards fingertip and unerr- \ningly strike their target. This includes ene- \nmy creatures in a melee. The target creature \nmust be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, \nhowever, so near-total concealment, such as \nin a 10-foot cube \nthat offered by arrow slits, can render the \nspell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must \nbe able to identify the target. He cannot \ndirect a magic missile to “Strike the com- \nmander of the legion,” unless he can single \nout the commander from the rest of the sol- \ndiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be \nsingled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) \ncannot be damaged by the spell, and any \nattempt to do so wastes the missiles to no \neffect. Against creatures, each missile \ninflicts ld4 + 1 points of damage. \nFor every two extra levels of experience, \nthe wizard gains an additional missile-he \nhas two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four \nat 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles \nat 9th level. If the wizard has multiple mis- \nsile capability, he can have them strike a sin- \ngle target creature or several creatures, as \ndesired. \nMending (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell repairs small breaks or tears in \nobjects. It will weld a broken ring, chain \nlink, medallion, or slender dagger, provid- \ning but one break exists. Ceramic or wood- \nen objects with multiple breaks can be \ninvisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A \nhole in a leather sack or wineskin is com- \npletely heal+ over by a mending spell. This \nspell does no , by itself, repair magical items \nof any type. bn e turn after the spell is cast, \nthe magic of the joining fades, and the effect \ncannot be magically dispelled. The maxi- \nmum volume of material the caster can \nmend is one cubic foot per level. \nThe material components of this spell are \ntwo small magnets of any type (lodestone in \nall likelihood) or two burrs. \nMessage (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can \nwhisper messages and receive replies with \nlittle chance of being overheard. When the \nspell IS cast,-the wizard secretly or openly \npoints his finger at each creature to be \nincluded in the spell effect. Up to one crea- \nture per level can be included. When the \nwizard whispers, the whispered message \ntravels in a straight line and is audible to all \nof the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus \n10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures \n------- \nwho receive the message can whisper aieply \nthat is heard by the spellcaster. Note that \nthere must be an unobstructed path between \nthe spellcaster and the recipients of the spell. \nThe message must be in a language the cast- \ner speaks; this spell does not by itself confer \nunderstanding upon the recipients. This \nspell is most often used to conduct quick \nand private conferences when the caster \ndoes not wish to be overheard. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nshort piece of copper drawn fine. \nMount (ConjuratiotVSuminoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 mount \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster conjures \na normal animal to serve him as a mount. \nThe animal serves willingly and well, but at \nthe expiration of the spell duration it disap- \npears, returning to its own place. The type \nof mount gained by this spell depends on the \nlevel of the caster; of course, a caster can \nchoose a lesser mount if desired. Available \nmounts include the following: \nCaster Level Mount \nlstdrd level \n4th-7th level Draft horse or \n8th-12th level Camel \n13th-14th level Elephant (and \n15th level & up \nMule or light horse \nwar horse \nhowdah at 18th level) \nGriffon (and saddle at \n18th level) \nThe mount does not come with any riding \ngear, unless it is of a class lower than the \ncaster would normally be entitled to; thus a \n4th-level wizard can gain a war horse with- \nout saddle and harness, or a light horse with \nsaddle and harness. The statistics of the ani- \nmal gained are typical of all creatures of the \nsame class. The mount disappears when \nslain. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of hair from the type of animal to be con- \njured. \nNystul’s Magical Aura \n(IIlusion/Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 dayllevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, any one item of no \nmore than five pounds weight per level of \nthe spellcaster can be given an aura that is \n136\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 137 | PDF_PAGE 138]\nnoticed by someone using magic detection. \nFurthermore, the caster can specify the type \nof magical aura that is detected (alteration, \nconjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks \nthe item's actual aura, if any, unless the \nitem's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if \nit is an artifact, for instance). If the object \nbearing Nystulk magical aura has an iden- \ntify spell cast on it or is similarly examined, \nthe examiner has a 50 % chance of recogniz- \ning that the aura has been placed to mislead \nthe unwary. Otherwise, the aura is believed \nand no amount of testing reveals what the \ntrue magic is. \nThe component for this spell is a small \nsquare of silk, which must be passed over \nthe object that receives the aura. \nPhantasmal Force (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nAreaofEffect:4OOsq.ft. + lOOsq.ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates the illusion of any \nobject, creature, or force, as long as it is \nwithin the boundaries of the spell's area of \neffect. The illusion is visual and affects all \nbelieving creatures (undead are immune) \nthat view it. It does not create sound, smell, \nor temperature. Effects that depend on these \nsenses usually fail. The illusion lasts until \nstruck by an opponent-unless the spell- \ncaster causes the illusion to react \nappropriately-or until the wizard ceases \nconcentration upon the spell (due to desire, \nmoving, or a successful attack that causes \ndamage). Saving throws for illusions are \nexplained under Illusion in the Magic chap- \nter (page 80) and on page 130. Creatures \nthat disbelieve the illusion see it for what it \nis and add +4 to dates' saving throws if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures believing the illusion are \nsubject to its effects, again as explained \nunder Illusions. \nThe illusionary effect can be moved by \nthe caster within the limits of the areatof \neffect. The DM has to rule on the effective- \nness of this spell; detailed guidelines are out- \nlined on page 130 and in Chapter 7: Magic. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of fleece. \nProtectlon From Evil (Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nCompone ts: V, S, M \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, it creates a magical \nbarrier around the recipient at a distance of \none foot. The barrier moves with the recipi- \nent and has three major effects: \nFirst, all attacks made by evil (or evilly \nenchanted) creatures against the protected \ncreature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; \nany saving throws caused by such attacks \nare made with +2 bonuses. \nSecond, any attempt to possess (as by a \nmagic jar attack) or to exercise mental con- \ntrol over (as by a vampire's charm ability) \nthe protected creature is blocked by this \nspell. Note that the protection does not pre- \nvent a vampire's charm itself, but it does \nprevent the exercise of mental control \nthrough the barrier. Likewise, a possessing \nlife force is merely kept out. It would not be \nexpelled if in place before the protection is \ncast. \nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact \nby creatures of an extraplanar or conjured \nnature (such as aerial servants, element&, \nimps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water \nweirds, xom, and others). This causes the \nnatural (body) weapon attacks of such crea- \ntures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if \nsuch attacks require touching the protected \nbeing. Animals or monsters summoned or \nconjured by spells or similar magic are like- \nwise hedged from the character. \nThis protection ends if the protected char- \nacter makes a melee attack against or tries to \nforce the barrier against the blocked crea- \nture. \nTo complete this spell, the wizard must \ntrace a three-footdiameter circle on the \nfloor (or ground) with powdered silver. \nThis spell can be reversed to become pro- \ntection from good; the second and third \nbenefits remaining unchanged. The material \ncomponent for the reverse is a circle of pow- \ndered iron. \nDuration: z rounddlevel \nRead Magic (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of a read magic spell, the wiz- \nard is able to read magical inscriptions on \nobjects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the \nlike-that would otherwise be totally unin- \ntelligible. (The personal books of the wiz- \n137 \nard, and works already magically read, gre \nintelligible.) This deciphering does not nor- \nmally invoke the magic contained in the \nwriting, although it may do so in the case of \na cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell \nis cast and the wizard has read the magical \ninscription, he is thereafter able to read that \nparticular writing without recourse to the \nuse of the read magic spell. The duration of \nthe spell is two rounds per level of experi- \nence of the spellcaster; the wizard can read \none page or its equivalent per round. \nThe wizard must have a clear crystal or \nmineral prism, which is not expended, to \ncast the spell. \nShield (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, an invisible barrier \ncomes into being in front of the wizard. This \nshield totally negates magic missile attacks. \nIt provides the equivalent protection of AC \njavelins, spears, etc.), AC 3 against small \ndevice-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, \nbullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), \nand AC 4 against all other form of attack. \nThe shield also adds a + 1 bonus to the wiz- \nards saving throws against attacks that are \nbasically frontal. Note that these benefits \napply only if the attacks originate from in \nfront of the wizard, where the shield can \nmove to interpose itself. \n2 against hand-hurled missiles (=a, darts, \nShocking Grasp (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard casts this spell, he \ndevekqm a powerful electrical charge tkat \ngives a jolt to the creature toucbi. Thc \nspell remains in effect for one rod act; \nlevel of the caster or until it is diochorgedbg \nthe caster touching another cream. The \nshocking grasp delivers Id8 points of dara \nage, plus 1 point per level of the wizard \n(e.g., a 2nd-level wizard wvuld discharge a \nshock causing Id8 +2 points of damage). \nWhiie the wizard must come close enough \nto his opponent to lay a hand on the oppo- \nnent's body or upon an electrical conductor \nthat touches the opponent's body, a like \ntouchfrom the opponent does not discharge \nthe spell.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 138 | PDF_PAGE 139]\n1 a‘ Wizard Spells (1 st Level) \nSleep (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a wizard casts a sleep spell, he \ncauses a comatose slumber to come upon \none or more creatures (other than undead \nand certain other creatures specifically \nexcluded from the spell’s effects). All crea- \ntures to be affected by thesleep spell must be \nwithin 30 feet of each other. The number of \ncreatures that can be affected is a function of \nHit Dice or levels. The spell affects 2d4 Hit \nDice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit \nDice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more \nare unaffected. The center of the area of \neffect is determined by the spellcaster. The \ncreatures with the least Hit Dice are affected \nfirst, and partial effects are ignored, \nFor example, a wizard casts sleep at three \nkobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll \n(2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one \ngnoll are affected (1/z + 1/z + 1/z + 2 = 3% \nHit Dice). Note that the remainder is not \nenough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. \nSlapping or wounding awakens affected \ncreatures but normal noise does not. Awak- \nening requires one entire round. Magically \nsleeping opponents can be attacked with \nsubstantial bonuses (see Combat, page 90). \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live \ncricket. \nSpider Climb (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA spider climb spell enables the recipient \nto climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as \nwell as a giant spider, or even hang upside \ndown from ceilings. Unwilling victims must \nbe touched and are then allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell to negate the effect. The \naffected creature must have bare hands and \nfeet in order to climb in this manner, at a \nmovement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). \nDuring the course of the spell, the recipient \ncannot handle objects that weigh less than a \ndagger (one pound), for such objects stick to \nhis hands and feet. Thus a wizard will find it \nvirtually impossible to cast spells if under a \nspider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull \nthe recipient free; the DM can assign a sav- \ning throw based on circumstances, the \nstrength of the force, and so on. For exam- \nple, a creature with a Strength of 12 might \npull the subject free if the subject fails a sav- \ning throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately \ndifficult saving throw). The caster can end \nthe spell effect with a word. \nThe material components of this spell are \na drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of \nwhich must be eaten by the spell recipient. \nSpook (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature within 30 feet \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA spook spell enables the wizard to play \nupon natural fears to cause the target crea- \nture to perceive the spellcaster as someone \nor something inimical. Without actually \nknowing what this is, the wizard merely \nadvances threateningly upon the creature. If \na successful saving throw vs. spell is not \nmade, the creature turns and flees at maxi- \nmum speed as far from the wizard as possi- \nble, though items carried are not dropped. \nThe creature has a saving throw penalty of \n-1 for every two experience levels of the \nthe caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th \nlevel. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll \nof 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of \nsaving throw penalties. Although the caster \ndoes not actually pursue the fleeing crea- \nture, a phantasm from its own mind does. \nEach round after the initial casting, the crea- \nture receives another saving throw, without \npenalty, until it successfully saves and the \nspell is broken. In any event, the spell func- \ntions only against creatures with Intelli- \ngences of 2 or more, and undead are not \naffected at all. \nTaunt (Enchantment) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA taunt spell enables the caster to jape \nand jeer effectively at a single type of crea- \nture with an Intelligence of 2 or greater. The \ncaster need not speak the language of the \ncreatures. His words and sounds have real \nmeaning for the subject creature or crea- \ntures: challenging, insulting, and generally \nirritating and angering the listeners. Those \nfailing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to \ndo battle with the spellcaster. All affected \ncreatures attack the spellcaster in melee if \nphysically capable of doing so, seeking to \nuse body or hand-held weapons rather than \nmissile weapons or spells. Separation of the \ncaster from the victim by an impenetrable \nor uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire, a \ndeep chasm, a formation of set pikemen) \n138 \ncauses the spell to break. If the caster taunts \na mixed group, he must choose the type of \ncreature to be affected. Creatures com- \nmanded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Cha- \nrisma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.) \nmight gain a saving throw bonus of +1 to \n+4, at the DMs discretion. If used in con- \njunction with a ventriloquism spell, the \ncreatures may attack the apparent source, \ndepending upon their Intelligence, a leader’s \npresence, and so on. \nThe material component is a slug, which \nis hurled at the creatures to be taunted. \nI \nTenser’s Floating Disc (Evocation) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 turns +~ 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the caster creates the \nslightly concave, circular plane of force \nknown as Tenser’s floating disc (after the \nfamed wizard whose greed and ability to \nlocate treasure are well known). The disc is \nthree feet in diameter and holds 100 pounds \nof weight per level of the wizard casting the \nspell. The disc floats at approximately three \nfeet above the ground at all times and \nremains level. It floats along horizontally \nwithin its range of 20 yards at the command \nof the caster, and will accompany him at a \nmovement rate of no more than 6. If \nunguided, it maintains a constant interval of \nsix feet between itself and the wizard. If the \nspellcaster moves beyond range (by moving \nfaster, or by such means as a teleport spell, \nor by trying to take it more than three feet \nfrom the surface beneath it), or if the spell \nduration expires, the floating disc winks out \nof existence and whatever it was supporting \ncrashes to the surface beneath it. \nThe material component of the spell is a \ndrop of mercury. \nUnseen Servant \n(ConjuratiodSummonining) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 tum/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: jo-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThe unseen servant is a non-visible, \nmindless, and shapeless force, used to step \nand fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold \nchairs, as well as to clean and mend. It is not \nstrong, but unfailingly obeys the command \nof the wizard. It can carry out only one \nactivity at a time and can move only light- \nweight items-carry a maximum of 20 \npounds or push or pull 40 pounds across a\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 139 | PDF_PAGE 140]\nsmooth surface. It can open only normal \ndoors, drawers, lids, etc. The unseen ser- \nvant cannot fight, nor can it be killed, as it is \na force rather than a creature. It can be mag- \nically dispelled, or eliminated after receiv- \ning 6 points of damage from area-effect \nspells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. If \nthe caster attempts to ‘md it beyond the \nallowed radius, the spell ends immediately. \nThe material components of the spell are \na uiece of string and a bit of wood. \nVemtrlloqulsm (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 10 yards/lwel, maximum 90 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to make his \nvoice-or someone else’s voice-or a simi- \nlar sound seem to issue from someplace else, \nsuch as from another creature, a statue, \nfrom behind a door, down a pa-, etc. \nThe spellcaster can speak in any language \nthat he knows, or make any sound that he \ncan normally make. With respect to such \nvoices and sounds, anyone rolling a success- \nful saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty \ndetects the ruse. If cast in conjunction with \nother illusions, the DM may rule greater \npenalties or disallow an independent saving \nthrow against this spell in consideration of \nits contribution to the total effect of the \ncombined illusion. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nparchment rolled up into a small cone. \nWall of Fog (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard creates a \nbillowing wall of misty vapors in any area \nwithin the spell range. The wall of fog \nobscures all sight, normal and infravision, \nbeyond two feet. The caster may create less \nvapor if he wishes. The wall must be a \nroughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least \nten feet wide in its smallest dimension. The \nmisty vapors persist for three or more \nrounds. Their duration can be halved by a \nmoderate wind, and they can be blown \naway by a strong wind. \nThe material component is a pinch of split \ndried peas. \nWizard Muk (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Up to 1 square foot \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto inscribe, visibly or invisibly, his personal \nrune or mark, as well as up to six additional \ncharacters of smaller size. A wizard mark \nspell enables the caster to etch the rune upon \nstone, metal, or any softer substance with- \nout harm to the material upon which the \nmark is placed. If an invisible mark is made, \na detect magic spell will cause it to glow and \nbe visible (though not necessarily under- \nstandable). Detect invisibility, true seeing, a \ngem of seeing, or a robe of eyes will likewise \nexpose an invisible wizard mark. A read \nmagic spell will reveal the maker’s words, if \nany. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it \ncan be removed by the caster or by an eruse \nspell. If cast on a living being, normal wear \ngradually causes the mark to fade. \nThe material components for this spell are \na pinch of diamond dust (about 100 gp \nworth) and a pigment or pigments for the \ncoloration of the mark. If the mark is to be \ninvisible, the pigments are still used, but the \ncaster uses a stylus of some sort rather than \nhis finger. \n139 \nSecond-Level Spells \nAlter Self (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3d4 rounds + 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can \nalter his appearance and form-including \nclothing and equipment-to appear taller or \nshorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, \nhumanoid, or any other generally man- \nshaped bipedal creature. The caster‘s body \ncan undergo a limited physical alteration \nandhissizecanbech~edupto509b.Ifthe \nform selected has wings, the wizard can \nactually fly, but at only 1/3 the speed of a \ntrue creature of that type, and with a loss of \ntwo maneuverability classes (to a minimum \nof E). If the form has gills, the caster can \nbreathe underwater as long as the spell lasts. \nHowever, any multiple attack routines or \nadditional damage allowed to an assumed \nform are not gained by the caster. \nThe caster’s attack rolls, Annor Class, \nand saving throws do not-change. The spell \ndoes not confer special abilities, attack \nforms, or defenses. Once the new form is \nchosen, it remains for the duration of the \nspell. The caster can change back into his \nown form at will; this ends the spell immedi- \nately. A caster who is slain automatically \nreturns to his normal form. \nMnd (Enchantment) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is employed, the wizard \ncan command any non-living ropelike \nobject, including string, yarn, cord, line, \nrope, or wen a cable. The spell affects 50 \nfeet of normal rope (one-inch diameter), \nplus five feet per caster level. This length is \nreduced by 50% for wery additional inch of \nthickness and increases by 50% for each ’/a \ninch less. The possible commands are Coil \n(form a neat, coiled stack), Coil & Knot, \nLoop, Loop & Knot, Tie 8t Knot, and the \nreverses of all of the above (Uncoil, etc.). \nOne command can be given each round. \nThe rope can only enwrap a creature or \nan object within one foot of it-it does not \nsnake outward-so it must be thrown or \nhurled near the intended target. Note that \nthe rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are \nnot magical. A typical rope might be AC 6 \nand take 4 points of slashing damage before \nbreaking. The rope does not inflict damage\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 140 | PDF_PAGE 141]\nof any type, but it can be used as a trip line \nor to entangle a single opponent who fails a \nsaving throw vs. spell. \nBlindness (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponent: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe blindness spell causes the victim to \nbecome blind, able to see only a grayness \nbefore its eyes. Various cure spells will not \nremove this effect, and only a dispel magic \nor the spellcaster can do away with the \nblindness if the creature fails its initial sav- \ning throw vs. spell. A blinded creature suf- \nfers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, and its \nopponents gain a +4 bonus to their attack \nrolls. \nBlur (IIIusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 rounaiievei \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a blur spell is cast, the wizard \ncauses the outline of his form to become \nblurred, shifting and wavering. This distor- \ntion causes all missile and melee combat \nattacks against the caster to be made with \n-4 penalties on the first attempt and -2 \npenalties on all successive attacks. It also \ngrants the wizard a + 1 bonus to his saving \nthrow for any direct magical attack. A \ndetect invisibility spell will not counter this \neffect, but the 5th-level clerical spell true \nseeing and similar magic will. \nContinual Ught (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to a light spell, except \nthat it is as bright as full daylight and lasts \nuntil negated by magical darkness or by a \ndispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer \npenalties in bright light suffer them in this \nspell's area of effect. As with the light spell, \nit can be cast into the air, onto an object, or \nat a creature. In the third case, the spell af- \nfects the space about one foot behind a crea- \nture that successfully rolls its saving throw \nvs. spell. Note that this spell can also blind a \ncreature if it is successfully cast upon the \nthe creature's attack rolls, saving throws, \nand Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on \na small object that is then placed in a light- \nproof covering, the spell's effects are \nblocked until the covering is removed. \nA continual light brought into an area of \nmagical darkness (or vice versa) is tempo- \nrarily negated so that the otherwise prevail- \ning light conditions exist in the overlapping \nareas of effect. A direct casting of continual \nlight against a similar or weaker magical \ndarkness cancels both. \nThis spell eventually consumes the mate- \nrial it is cast upon, but the process takes far \nlonger than the time in the typical cam- \npaign. Extremely hard and expensive mate- \nrials can last hundreds or even thousands of \nyears. \nDarkness, 15' Radius (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: '15-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes total, impenetrable \ndarkness in the area of effect. Infravision is \nuseless. Neither normal nor magical lat \nworks unless a light or continual light spell \nis used. In the former event, the darkness \nspell is negated by the light spell and vice \nversa. \nThe material components of this spell are \na bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a \npiece of coal. \nDeafness (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe deafness spell causes the recipient to \nbecome totally deaf and unable to hear any \nsounds. The victim is allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell. An affected creature has a \n-1 penalty to its surprise rolls unless its \nother senses are unusually keen. Deafened \nspellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast \nany spell with a verbal component. This \ndeafness can be done away with only by \nmeans of a dispel magic spell or by the spell- \ncaster. \nThe material component of this spell is \nbeeswax. \nDeeppockets (Alteration, Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 garment \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to specially \nprepare a garment so as to hold far more \nthan it normally could. A finely sewn gown \nor robe of highquality material (at least 50 \ngp value) is fashioned so as to contain \nnumerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is \nthe minimum number. The deeppockets \nspell then enables these pockets to hold a \ntotal of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in vol- \nume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. \nFurthermore, there are no discernible bulges \nwhere the special pockets are. At the time of \ncasting, the caster can instead chose to have \n10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 \ncubic foot volume each). If the robe or like \ngarment is sewn with 100 or more pockets \n(200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be \ncreated to contain one pound of weight and \n'/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special \npocket is actually an extradimensional hold- \ning space. \nIf the spell duration expires while there is \nmaterial within the enchanted pockets, or if \na successful dispel magic is cast upon the \nenchanted garment, all the material sudden- \nly appears around the wearer and immedi- \nately falls to the ground. The caster can also \ncause all the pockets to empty with a single \ncommand. \nIn addition to the garment, which is reus- \nable, the material components of this spell \nare a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine \ncloth given a half-twist and fastened at the \nends. \nDetect Evil (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot path \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell discovers emanations of evil (or \nof good in the case of the reverse spell) from \nany creature, object, or area. Character \nalignment is not revealed under most cir- \ncumstances: characters who are strongly \naligned, do not stray from their faith, and \nwho are at least 9th level might radiate good \nor evil if they are intent upon appropriate \nactions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, \nsend forth emanations of evil or good, even \nif polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate \nevil, for it is this power and negative force \nthat enable them to continue existing. An \ni\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 141 | PDF_PAGE 142]\nWizard Spells (2nd Level) \nevilly cursed object or unholy water radi- \nates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelli- \ngent viper does not. The degree of evil \n(faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) \ncan be noted. Note that priests have a more \npowerful version of this spell. \nThe spell has a path of detection ten feet \nwide in the direction in which the mage is \nfacing. The wizard must concentrate-stop, \nhave quiet, and intently seek to detect the \naura-for at least one round to receive a \nreading. \nDetect invisibility (Divination) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: lefoot path \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard casts a detect inursibility \nspell, he is able to see clearly any objects or \nbeings that are invisible, as well as any that \nare astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addi- \ntion, it enables the wizard to detect hidden \nor concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in \nshadows, halflings in underbrush, and so \non). It does not reveal the method of con- \ncealment or invisibility, except in the case of \nastral travelers (where the silver cord can be \nseen). It does not reveal illusions or enable \nthe caster to see through physical objects. \nDetection is in the wizards line of sight \nalong a ten-foot-wide path to the range \nlimit. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of \npowdered silver. \nESP (Divination) \nRange: 5 yards/level, 90 yards maximum \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature per probe \nSaving Thrpw: None \nWhen an ESP spell is used, the caster is \nable to detect the surface thoughts of any \ncreatures in range-except for those of un- \ndead and creatures without minds (as we \nknow them). The ESP is stopped by two or \nmore feet of rock, two or more inches of any \nmetal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead \nfoil. The wizard employing the spell is able \nto probe the surface thoughts of one crea- \nture per round, getting simple instinctual \nthoughts from lower order creatures. \nProbes can continue on the same creature \nfrom round to round or can move on to \nother creatures. The caster can use the spell \nto help determine if a creature lurks behind \na door, for example, but the ESP does not al- \nways reveal what sort of creature it is. If \nused as part of a program of interrogation, \nan intelligent and wary subject receives an \ninitial saving throw. If successful, the crea- \nture successfully resists and the spell reveals \nno additional information. If the saving \nthrow is failed, the caster may learn addi- \ntional information, according to the DMs \nruling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment \napplies, as may additional bonuses up to \n+4, based on the sensitivity of the informa- \ntion sought. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ncopper piece. \nFlaming Sphere (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 3-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA flaming sphere spell creates a burning \nglobe of fire within ten yards of the caster. \nThis sphere rolls in whichever direction the \nwizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round. \nIt rolls over barriers less than four feet tall, \nsuch as furniture, low walls, etc. Flammable \nsubstances are set afire by contact with the \nsphere. Creatures in contact with the globe \nmust successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4 \npoints of fire damage. Those within five feet \nof the sphere's surface must also save or suf- \nfer ld4 points of heat damage. A successful \nsaving throw means no damage is suffered. \nThe DM may adjust the saving throws if \nthere is little or no room to dodge the \nsphere. \nThe sphere moves as long as the spell- \ncaster actively directs it, otherwise it merely \nstays at rest and bums. It can be extin- \nguished by the same means as any normal \nfire of its size. The surface of the sphere has \na spongy, yielding consistency and so does \nnot cause damage except by its flame. It can- \nnot push unwilling creatures aside or batter \ndown large obstacles. \nThe material components are a bit of tal- \nlow, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of \npowdered iron. \nFog Cloud (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe fog cloud spell can be cast in either \none of two ways, at the caster's option: as a \nlarge, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a \nharmless fog that resembles the 5th-level \nwizard spell, cloudkill. \nAs a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of \nany size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot \ncube per caster level. The fog obscures all \n141 \nsight, normal and infravision, beyond two \nfeet. \ninto the vegetation. \nscure vision.

The area of effect is ten cubic inches \nper level-i.e., a 1\" x 1\" x 10\" volume or \nequivalent, equal to about 150 gold coins. \nAny creature viewing the \"gold is entitled \nto a saving throw vs. spell, which can be \nmodified by the creature's Wisdom; for ev- \nery level of the wizard, the creature must \nsubtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is un- \nlikely that fools' gold will be detected if it \nwas created by a high-level caster. If the \n\"gold is struck hard by an object of cold- \nwrought iron, there is a slight chance it will \nrevert to its natural state, depending on the \nmaterial component used to create the - \n\"gold.\" If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and \nsprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, \nthe chance that cold iron will return it to its \ntrue nature is 30%; if a 50-m amber stone is \npowdered and used, there is a 25% chance \nthat iron will dispel the magic; if a 2Sgp \ntopaz is powdered, the chance drops to \n10%; if a 500-g~ oriental (corundum) topaz \nis powdered, there is only a 1 % chance that \nthe cold iron will reveal that it is fools' gold. \nth .\\\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 142 | PDF_PAGE 143]\nt I \nWizard Snells (2nd Levd\\ \nFwget (EnchantmenVChann) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the spell caste^ \ncauses creatures within the area of effect tc \nforget the events of the previous round (the \none minute of time previous to the utterance \nof the spell). For every three levels of experi- \nence of the spellcaster, another minute of \npast time is forgotten. This does not negate \ncham, suggestion, gem, quest, or similar \nspells, but it is possible that the being who \nplaced such magic upon the recipient could \nbe forgotten. From one to four creatures can \nbe affected, at the discretion of the caster. If \nonly one is to be affected, the recipient saves \nvs. spell with a -2 penalty; if two, they \nsave with - 1 penalties; if three or four are \nto be affected, they save normally. All sav- \ning throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A \npriest's heal or restoration spell, if specially \ncast for this purpose, will restore the lost \nmemories, as will a limited wish or wish, \nbut no other means will do so. \nGlitterdust (Conjuration/Sumrnoning) \nRange: 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a cloud of glittering \ngolden particles within the area of effect. \nThose in the area must roll a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell or be blinded ( - 4 penal- \nties to attack rolls, saving throws, and \nArmor Class) for ld4 + 1 rounds. In addi- \ntion, all within the area are covered by the \ndust, which cannot be removed and con- \ntinues to sparkle until it fades. Note that this \nreveals invisible creatures. The dust fades in \nld4 rounds plus one round per caster level. \nThus glitterdust cast by a 3rd-level wizard \nlasts for four to seven rounds. \nThe material component is ground mica. \nHypnotic Pattern (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: %foot cube \nSavingThrow: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard Creates \na weaving, twisting pattern of subtle colors \nin the air. This pattern causes any creature \nlooking at it to become fascinated and stand \ngazing at it as long as the spellcaster main \ntains the display, plus two rounds there \nafter. The spell can captivate a maximum o \n24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures (e.g., 21 \ncreatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hii \nDice, etc). All creatures affected must bc \nwithin the area of effect, and each is entitlec \nto a saving throw vs. spell. A damage \ninflicting attack on an affected creature fre \nit from the spell immediately. \nThe mage need not utter a sound, but he \nmust gesture appropriately while holding a \nglowing stick of incense or a crystal rod \nfilled with phosphorescent material. \nImproved Phantasmal Force \n(Illusion/Phantasrn) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 200 sq. ft./ + 50 sq.ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nLike the 1st-level phantasmal force spell, \nthis spell creates the illusion of any object, \ncreature, or force, as long as it is within the \nspell's area of effect. The spellcaster can \nmaintain the illusion with minimal concen- \ntration, thus he can move at half normal \nspeed (but not cast other spells).. Some mi- \nlor sounds are included in the effects of the \nipell, but not understandable speech. Also, \n,he improved phantasm continues for two \neounds after the wizard ceases to concen- \nrate upon it. \nThe material component is a bit of fleece. \nInvisibility (Illusion/Phantasrn) \ntange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nZasting Time: 2 \n4rea of Effect: Creature touched \nsaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes the creature touched to \nranish from sight and be undetectable by \niormal vision or even infravision. Of \n:ourse, the invisible creature is not magi- \n:ally silenced, and certain other conditions \n*an render the creature detectable. Even al- \nies cannot see the invisible creature or his \n;ear, unless these allies can normally see in- \nrisible things or employ magic to do so. \ntems dropped or put down by the invisible \nreature become visible, items picked up \n'isappear if tucked into the clotlung or \nouches worn by the creature. Note, how- \nver, that light never becomes invisible, al- \n~ough a source of light can become so (thus \nie effect is that of a light with no visible \nsource). \nThe spell remains in effect until it is magi- \ncally broken or dispelled, until the wizard \nor recipient cancels it, until the recipient at- \ntacks any creature, or until 24 hours have \npassed. Thus the invisible being can open \ndoors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he \nattacks, he immediately becomes visible, al- \nthough the invisibility enables him to attack \nfirst. Note that the clerical bless, chmt, and \nprayer spells are not attacks for this pur- \npose. All highly Intelligent (Int 13 or more) \ncreatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels \nof experience have a chance to detect invisi- \nble objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; \nsuccess means they noticed the invisible ob- \nject). \nThe material components of the inuisibil- \nity spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum ara- \nbic, the former encased in the latter. \nIrritation (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a 15-foot- \nradius area \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nAn im'fation spell affects the epidermis of \nthe subject creatures. Creatures with very \nihick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, \nrlephants, scaled Creatures, etc.) are basi- \n:ally unaffected by this. There are two ver- \niions of the spell, either of which can be cast \n'rom the standard preparation: \nItching. When cast, this causes each sub- \nect to feel an instant itching sensation on, \n,ome portion of its body. If one round is not \nrnmediately spent scratching the irritated \nrea, the creatw is so affected that the next \nhree rounds are spent squirming and twist- \nng, effectively worsening its Armor Class by \n1 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. \nSpell preparations are ruined in the first \nsound this spell is in effect, but not in the fol- \nowing three rounds. Doing nothing but \nmatching the itch for a full round prevents \nhe rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, \nhe saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at \nwo creatures, the saving throw has a -1 \nmalty; and if cast at three or four Creatures, \nhe saving throw is normal. \nRash. When a rash is cast, the subject no- \nices nothing for ld4 rounds, but thereafter \nts entire skin breaks out in red welts that \ntch. The rash persists until either a cure dis- \nuse or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It \n3wers Charisma by 1 point per day for each \nf four days (i.e.f maximum Charisma loss \ni 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is \n>wered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish \nnmediately upon the removal of the rash, \nnd all statistics return to normal. This can \ne cast at one creature only, with a saving \nwow penalty of - 2. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac \n142\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 143 | PDF_PAGE 144]\nKnock (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponent: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10 square reerilevel \nSaving Throw: None \nThe knock spell opens stuck, barred, \nlocked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It \nopens secret doors, as well as locked or \ntrick-opening boxes or chests. It also loos- \nens welds, shackles, or chains. If used to \nopen a wizard-locked door, the spell does \nnot remove the former spell, but simply sus- \npends its functioning for one turn. In all \nother cases, it permanently opens locks or \nwelds-although the former could be closed \nand locked again later. It does not raise \nbarred gates or similar impediments (such as \na portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, \nand the like. Note that the effect is limited \nby the area; a 3rd-level wizard can knock a \ndoor of 30 square feet or less (e.g., a stand- \nard 4' x 7' door). Each spell can undo up to \ntwo means of preventing egress through a \nportal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and \nheld, or triple locked, opening it requires \ntwo knock spells. In all cases, the location of \nthe door or item must be known-the spell \ncannot be used against a wall in hopes of \ndiscovering a secret door. \nThe reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a \ndoor or similar closure, provided there is a \nphysical mechanism. It does not create a \nweld, but it locks physically operated lock- \ning mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to \ntwo functions. It cannot affect a portcullis. \nKnow Alignment (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nper 2 rounds \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA know alignment spell enables the wiz- \nard to read the aura of a creature or an \naligned object (unaligned objects reveal \nnothing). The caster must remain stationary \nand concentrate on the subject for two full \nrounds. A creature is allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell and, if successful, the caster \nlearns nothing about that particular crea- \nture from the casting. If a creature or object \nis concentrated on for only one round, only \nits alignment with respect to law and chaos \ncan be learned. Certain magical devices ne- \ngate the know alignment spell. \nThe reverse, undetectable alignment, \nconceals the alignment of an object or crea- \n143 \nture for 24 hours-even from a know align- \nment spell. \nLeomund's Trap (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: Object touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis false trap is designed to fool a thief or \nother character attempting to pilfer the \nspellcaster's goods. The wizard places the \nspell upon any small mechanism or device, \nsuch as a lock, hinge, hasp, screw-on cap, \nratchet, etc. Any character able to detect \ntraps, or who uses any spell or device ena- \nbling trap detection, is 100% certain a real \ntrap exists. Of course, the spell is illusory \nand nothing happens if the trap is sprung; its \nprimary purpose is to friiten away thieves \nor make them waste precious time. \nThe material component of the spell is a \npiece of iron pyrite touched to the object to \nbe trapped while the object is sprinkled with \na special dust requiring 200 gp to prepare. If \nanother LeomundS trap is within 50 feet \nwhen the spell is cast, then the casting fails. \nLevitate (Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen a levitate spell is cast, the wizard \ncan place it upon his person, upon an ob- \nject, or upon a single creature, subject to a \nmaximum weight limit of 100 pounds per \nlevel of experience (e.g., a 3rd-level wizard \ncan levitate up to 300 pounds maximum). If \nthe spell is cast upon the wizard, he can \nmove vertically up or down at a movement \nrate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or \nanother creature, the wizard can levitate it \nat the same speed according to his com- \nmand. Horizontal movement is not empow- \nered by this spell, but the recipient could \npush along the face of a cliff, for example, to \nmove laterally. The spellcaster can cancel \nthe spell as desired. If the subject of the spell \nis unwilling, or the object is in the posses- \nsion of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is \nallowed to determine if the levitate spell af- \nfects it. \nOnce cast, the spell requires no concen- \ntration, except when changing height. A \nlevitating creature attempting to use a mis- \nsile weapon finds himself increasingly un- \nstable; the first attack has an attack roll \npenalty of -1, the second -2, and the third \n-3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full \nround spent stabilizing allows the creature \nto begin again at -1. lack of leverage \nmakes it impossible to cock a meclium or \nheavy crossbow. \nThe material component of this speH is ei- \nther a small leather loop or a piece of \nwire bent into a cup shape with a lon \non one end \n' ' \nLocate Object (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell aids in locating a known or fa- \nmiliar object. The wizard casts the spell, \nslowly turns, and senses when he is facirtg in \nthe direction of the object to be located, pro- \nvided the object is within range, i.e., 60 \nyards for 3rd-level mages, 80 yards for rth, \n100 yards for 5th, etc. The spell can locate \nsuch objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, \ntools, weapons, or even a ladder or stair- \nway. Note that attempting to find a specific \nitem such as jewelry or a crown, requires an \naccurate mental image; if the image is not \nclose enough to the actual, the spell does not \nwork. Desired but unique objects cannot be \nlocated by this spell unless they are known \nby the caster. The spell is blocked by lead. \nCreatures cannot be found by this spell. \nThe material component is a forked twig. \nThe reversal, obscure object, hides an ob- \nject from location by spell, crystal ball, or \nsimilar means for eight hours. Creatures \ncannot be affected by this spell. The mate- \nrial component is a chameleon skin. \nMaglc Mouth (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard imbues \nthe chosen object with an enchanted mouth \nthat suddenly appears and speaks his mes- \nsage when a specified event occurs. The \nmessage, which must be of 25 words or less, \ncan be in any language known by the spell- \ncaster, and can be delivered over a one-turn \nperiod. The mouth cannot speak magical \nspells or use command words. It does, how- \never, move to the words articulated-if it is \nplaced upon a statue, the mouth of the \nstatue would actually move and appear to \nspeak. Of course, the magic mouth can be \nplaced upon a tree, rock, door, or any other \nobject, excluding intelligent membem of the \nanimal or vegetable kingdoms.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 144 | PDF_PAGE 145]\nIr \nIf \nThe spell functions when specific condi- \ntions are fulfilled, according to the com- \nmand of the spellcaster. Some examples are \nto speak \"to the first creature that touches \nyou,\" or \"to the first creature that passes \nwithin 30 feet .\" Commands can be as general \nor as detailed as desired, although only vis- \nual and audible triggers can be used, such as \nthe following: \"Speak only when a venera- \nble female human carrying a sack of groat \nclusters sits crosslegged within one foot.\" \nSuch visual triggers can react to a character \nusing the disguise ability. Command range \nis five yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th- \nlevel wizard can command the magic mouth \nto speak at a maximum encounter range of \n30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature \ncomes within 30 yards.\"). The spell lasts un- \ntil the speak command can be fulfilled, thus \nthe spell duration is variable. A magic \nmouth cannot distinguish invisible crea- \ntures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, \nexcept by external garb. If desired, the effect \ncan be keyed to a specific noise or spoken \nword. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall bit of honeycomb. \nMelf's Acid AROW (Conjuration) \nRange 180 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 target \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \na magical arrow that speeds to its target as if \nfired from the bow of a fighter of the same \nlevel as the wizard. No modifiers for range, \nnon-proficiency, or specialization are used. \nThe arrow has no attack or damage bonus, \nbut it inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage \n(with saving throws for items on the target). \n(There is no splash damage.) For every three \nlevels that the caster has achieved, the acid \nlasts for another round, unless somehow \nneutralized, inflicting another 2d4 points of \ndamage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the \nacid lasts two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the \nacid lasts for three rounds, etc. \nThe material components of the spell are \na dart, powdered rhubarb leaf, and an ad- \nder's stomach. \nbw \nMinor Image (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a mirror image spell is invoked, thc \nspellcaster causes from two to eight exac \nduplicates of himself to come into beiq \naround him. These images do exactly whal \nthe wizard does. Since the spell causes i \nblurring and slight distortion when it is cast, \nit is impossible for opponents to be certain \nwhich are the illusions and which is the ac- \ntual wizard. When an image is struck by a \nmelee or missile attack, magical or other- \nwise, it disappears, but any other existing \nimages remain intact until struck. The im- \nages seem to shift from round to round, so \nthat if the actual wizard is struck during one \nround, he cannot be picked out from among \nhis images the next. To determine the num- \nber of images that appear, roll ld4 and add 1 \nfor every three levels of experience the wiz- \nard has achieved, to a maximum of eight im- \nages. At the end of the spell duration, all \nsurviving images wink out. \nirection (IllusiodPhPntasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 8 hours \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizard misdi- \nrects the information from a detection spell \n(detect cham, detect mil, detect invisibil- \nity, detect lie, defect magic, detect snares \nand pits, etc.). While the detection spell \nfunctions, it indicates the wrong area, crea- \nture, or the opposite of the truth with re- \nspect to detect evil or detect lie. The wizard \ndirects the spell effect upon the object of the \ndetection spell. If the caster of the detection \nspell fails his saving throw vs. spell, the mis- \ndirection takes place. Note that this spell \ndoes not affect other types of divination \n(know alignment, augury, ESe claimoy- \nance, etc.). \nProtection From Cantrips (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature or object touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard receives \nimmunity to the effects of cantrips cast by \nother wizards, apprentices, or creatures that \n144 \nuse the cantrfp spell. The spell protects the \ncaster, or one item or person that he touches \n(such as a spell book or a drawer containing \nspell components). Any cantrip cast against \nthe protected person or item dissipates with \nan audible popping sound. This spell is of- \nten used by a wizard who has mischievous \napprentices, or one who wishes apprentices \nto clean or shine an area using elbow grease \nrather than magic. Any unwilling target of \nthis spell must be touched (via an attack \nroll) and is allowed a saving throw vs. spell \nto escape the effect. \nPyrotechnics (&&ration) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 fire source (special) \nSaving Throw: None \nA pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing \nfire source to produce either of two effects, \nat the option of the caster. First, it can pro- \nduce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, \ncolored aerial fireworks that lasts one \nround. This effect temporarily blinds those \ncreatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the \narea and that have an unobstructed line of \nsight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are \nblinded for ld4 + 1 rounds unless they SIC- \ncessfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a \nvolume ten times greater than that of the \nxiginal fire source. \nThis spell can also cause a thick, writhing \nitream of smoke to arise from the source \nand form a choking cloud that lasts for one \nmound per experience level of the caster. This \n:overs a roughly spherical volume from the \nyound or floor up (or conforming to the \nhape of a confined area) that totally ob- \nmres vision beyond two feet. The smoke \nills a volume 100 times that of the fire \nource. All within the cloud must rolI 8uc- \n*essful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 \nmalties to all combat rolls and &or \n:lass. \nThe spell uses one fire source within a 20- \noot cube, which is immediately extin- \nuished. An extremely large fire used as a \nource might be only partially extinguished. \ndagical fires are not extinguished, although \nfire-based mature (such as a fire elemen- \nat) used as a source suffers 1 point of dam- \nge per caster level.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 145 | PDF_PAGE 146]\nWizard Spells (2nd Level, \nRay of Enfeeblement \n(EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 10 yards + 5 yiirddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of a ray of enfeeblement, a wiz- \nard weakens an opponent, reducing its \nStrength and thereby the attacks that rely \nupon it. Humans, demihumans, and hu- \nmanoids of man-size or less are reduced to \nan effective Strength of 5, losing all Strength \nbonuses and suffering an attack roll penalty \nof -2 and a -1 penalty to damage. Other \ncreatures suffer a penalty of -2 on attack \nrolls. Furthermore, they have a \n- 1 penalty for each die of damage they in- \nflict. (But no damage roll can inflict less \nthan 1 point per die of damage.) Your DM \nwill determine any other effects appropriate \nto the affected creature. If the target crea- \nture makes its saving throw, the spell has no \neffect. This spell does not affect combat bo- \nnuses due to magical items, and those con- \nferring increased Strength function \nnormally. \nRope Trick (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 turns/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw. None \nWhen this spell is cast upon a piece of \nrope from five to 30 feet long, one end of the \nrope rises into the air until the whole hangs \nperpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. \nThe upper end is, in fact, fastened to an ex- \ntradimensional space. The spellcaster and \nup to seven others can climb up the rope and \ndisappear into this place of safety where no \ncreature can find them. The rope can be \ntaken into the extradimensional space if \nfewer than eight persons have climbed it, \notherwise it simply stays hanging in the air \n(extremely strong creatures might be able to \nremove it, at the DMs option). Spells can- \nnot be cast across the interdimensional,in- \nterface, nor can area effects cross it. Those \nin the extradimensional space can see out of \nit as if there is a 3' x 5' window centered on \nthe rope. The persons in the extradimen- \nsional space must climb down prior to the \nend of the spell, or they are dropped from \nthe height at which they entered the extradi- \nmensional space. The rope can be climbed \nby only one person at a time. Note that the \nrope trick spell enables climbers to reach a \nnormal place if they do not climb all the way \nto the extradimensional space. Also note \nthat creating or taking extradimensional \nspaces into an existing extradimensional \nspace is hazardous. \nThe material components of this spell are \npowdered corn extract and a twisted loop of \nparchment. \nScare (EnchantmenVCharm) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell causes creatures with fewer \nthan 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall \ninto fits of trembling and shaking. The \nfrightened creatures have a -2 reaction ad- \njustment and may drop items held if encum- \nbered. If cornered, they fight, but with -1 \npenalties to attack and damage rolls, and to \nsaving throws as well. \nOnly elves, half-elves, and priests are al- \nlowed saving throws against this spell. Note \nthat this spell has no effect on the undead \n(skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and so on), or \non upper or lower planar creatures of any \nsort. \nThe material component used for this \nspell is a bit of bone from an undead skele- \nton, zombie, ghoul, ghast, or mummy. \nShatter (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 3-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe shatter spell is a sound-based attack \nthat affects nonmagical objects of crystal, \nglass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, \nbottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. \nAll such objects within a three-foot radius \nof the center of the spell effect are smashed \ninto dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects \nweighing more than one pound per level of \nthe caster are not affected, but all other ob- \njects of the appropriate composition must \nsave vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Al- \nternatively, the spell can be focused against \na single item of up to 10 pounds per caster \nlevel. Crystalline creatures usually suffer \nId6 points of damage per caster level to a \nmaximum of 6d6, with a saving throw vs. \nspell for half damage. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nchip of mica. \nSpectral Hand (Necromancy) \nRange: 30 yards + 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 opponent \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, \nshaped from the caster's life force, to materi- \nalize within the spell range and move as the \ncaster desires. Any touch attack spell of 4th \nlevel or less that is subsequently cast by the \nwizard can be delivered by the spectral \nhand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus \nto his attack roll. The caster cannot perfom \nany other actions when attacking with the \nhand; the hand returns to the caster and \nhovers if the caster takes other actions. ' ! \nhand lasts the full spell duration unless ais- \nmissed by the caster, and it is possible to use \nmore than one touch attack with it. The \nhand receives flank and rear attack bonuses \nif the caster is in a position to do so. The \nhand is vulnerable to magical attack (but it \nhas an Armor Class of -2). Any damage to \nthe hand ends the spell and inflicts ld4 \npoints of damage to the caster. \n. \nStinking Cloud (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration 1 round/level \nCasting Time:2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special I \nWhen a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard I \ncreates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors \nup to 30 yards away from his pitien. Any \ncreature caught within the cloud must roll a \nsuccessful saving throw vs. poison or be \nreeling and unable to attack because of MU- \nsea, for ld4 + 1 rounds after leaving the \ncloud. Those who make successful saving \nthrows can leave the cloud without &- \ning any ill effects, although those remaihiRg \nin the cloud must continue to save each \nround. These poisonous effects can be \nslowed or neutralized by appropriate \nmagic. The cloud duration is halved in a \nmoderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h) and is dis- \npersed in one round by a stronger breeze. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nrotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves. \nI \nI \n1 \nI \n145\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 146 | PDF_PAGE 147]\nWizard Spells (2nd Level) \nStr teration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Person touched \nSaving Throw: None \nApplication of this spell increases the \nStrength of the character by a number of \npoints-or tenths of points after 18 Strength \nis attained (only if the character is a war- \nrior). Benefits of the strength spell last for \nthe duration of the magic. The amount of \nadded Strength depends upon the spell re- \ncipient‘s group and is subject to all restric- \ntions on Strength due to race and class. \nMulti-class characters use the best die. \nClaSS Strength Gain \nPriest ld6 points \nRogue ld6 points \nWarrior ld8 points \nWizard ld4 points \nIf a warrior has an 18 Strength already, \nfrom 10% to 80% is added to his extraordi- \nnary Strength roll. The spell cannot confer a \nStrength of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative \nwith other magic that adds to Strength. Be- \nings without Strength scores (kobolds, liz- \nard men, etc.) receive a +1 to attack and \ndamage rolls. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nfew hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a partic- \nularly strong animal-ape, bear, ox, etc. \nSummon Swum \n(ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe swarm of small animals (roll on fol- \nlowing table to determine type, or the DM \ncan assign an appropriate creature) drawn \nby the summon mum spell will viciously \nattack all creatures in the area chosen by the \ncaster.

A protection from evil spell keeps \nthe swarm at bay, and certain area-effect \nspells, such as gust of wind and stinking \ncloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if ap- \npropriate to the swarm summoned (e.g., \nonly flyers are affected by a gust of wind). \nThe caster must remain stationary and un- \ndisturbed to control the swm; if his con- \ncentration lapses or is broken, the swarm \ndisperses in two rounds. The swarm is sta- \ntionary once conjured. \nThe material component is a square of red \ncloth. \nTasha’s Uncontrollable Hideous \nLaughter (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a \n%foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe victim of this spell perceives every- \nthing as hilariously funny. The effect is not \nimmediate, and the creature feels only a \nslight tingling on the round the spell is cast. \nOn the round immediately following, the \nvictim begins smiling, then giggling, chuck- \nling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and fi- \nnally collapsing into gales of \nuncontrollable, hideous laughter. Although \nthis magical mirth lasts only a single round, \nthe affected creature must spend the next \nround regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points \nfrom its Strength (or -2 to attack and dam- \nage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the \nspell. \nThe saving throw vs. spell is modified by \nthe Intelhgence of the creature. Creatures \nwith Intelligences of 4 or less (semi- \nintelligent) are totally unaffected. Those \nwith Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with -6 \npenalties. Those with Intelligences of 8-12 \n(average to very) save with -4 penalties. \nThose with Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save \nwith -2 penalties. Those with Intelligences \nof 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodi- \nfied saving throws. \nThe caster can affect one creature for ev- \nery three levels attained-e.g., one at 3rd \nlevel, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc. \nAll affected beings must be within 30 feet of \neach other. \nThe material components are a small \nfeather and minute tarts. The tarts are \nhurled at the subjects, while the feather is \nwaved in one hand. \nWeb (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 turndlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. or */z \nA web spell creates a many-layered mass \nof strong, sticky strands similar to spider \nwebs but far larger and tougher. These \nmasses must be anchored to two or more \nsolid and diametrically opposed points- \nfloor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the \nweb collapses upon itself and disappears. \nThe we& spell covers a maximum area of \neight 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cubes and the webs must \nbe at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet \nhigh, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be \ncast. Creatures caught within webs, or sim- \nply touching them, become stuck among the \ngluey fibers. \nAnyone in the area when the spell is cast \nmust roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 \npenalty. If the saving throw is successful, \ntwo things may have occurred. If the crea- \nture has room to escape the area, then it is \nper round. If the webs \nthese rates are doubled \nto great strength in thi \nof large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong \nand huge creatures can break through 10 \nfeet of webs per round. \nFurthermore, the strands of a we& spell \nare flammable. A magical flaming sword \ncan slash them away as easily as a hand \nbrushes away cobwebs. Any fire-torch, \nflaming oil, flaming sword, etc.-can set \nthem alight and burn them away in a single \nround. All creatures within flaming webs \nsuffer 2d4 points of damage from the \nflames, but those free of the strands are not \nharmed. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nbit of spider web. \n146\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 147 | PDF_PAGE 148]\nI Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nWhispering Wind \n(Alteration, Phantasm) \nRange: 1 mile/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 2-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto either send a message or cause some de- \nsired sound effect. The whispering wind can \ntravel as many miles above ground as the \nspellcaster has levels of experience, to a spe- \ncific location within range that is familiar to \nthe wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle \nand unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches \nthe location. It then delivers its whisper- \nquiet message or other sound. Note that the \nmessage is delivered regardless of whether \nanyone is present to hear it. The wind then \ndissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell \nto bear a message of up to 25 words, cause \nthe spell to deliver other sounds for one \nround, or merely have the whispering wind \nseem to be a faint stirring of the air that has \na susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the \nwhispering wind to move as slowly as a mile \nper hour or as quickly as a mile every turn. \nWhen the spell reaches its objective, it swirls \nand remains until the message is delivered. \nAs with the magic mouth spell, no spells \nmay be cast via the Whispering wind. \nWlzud Lock (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 30 square feet/level \nSaving Throw: None \nA wizard lock spell cast upon a door, \nhest, or portal magically locks it. The \naster can freely pass his own lock without \nffecting it; otherwise, the wizard-locked \nor or object can be opened only by break- \nthe one casting the spell. Note \nother planes cannot burst a wizard lock as \nthey can a held portal (see the hold portal \nspell). \nThird-Level Spells \nBlink (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes \nhis material form to \"blink directly from \none point to another at a random time and \nin a random direction. This means that me- \nlee attacks against the wizard automatically \nmiss if initiative indicates they fall after he \nhas blinked. \nEach round the spell is in effect, the wiz- \nard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the \nblink-the result of the dice roll is used as \nthe wizards initiative for that round. The \nwizard disappears and instantaneously re- \nappears 10 feet distant from his previous po- \nsition. (Direction is determined by roll of \nld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right \nbehind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = \nleft, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster \ncannot blink into a solid object; if such is in- \ndicated, reroll the direction. Movable ob- \njects of size and mass comparable to the \ncaster are shoved aside when the caster \nblinks in. If blinking is impossible except \ninto a fixed, solid object, the caster is then \ntrapped on the Ethereal plane. \nDuring each round that he blinks, the \nspellcaster can be attacked only by oppo- \nnents who win initiative or by those who are \nable to strike both locations at once (e.g., \nwith a breath weapon, fireball, or similar \nwide-area attack forms). Opponents with \nmultiple attacks, or those operating under \nhaste or similar effects, can often strike \nearly enough to have at least one attack \nagainst the caster. \nIf the spellcaster holds off his attack (if \nany) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until \nthe blink is added to his normal ldl0 initia- \ntive roll (thus he probably attacks last in the \nround). Or the spellcaster can try to get his \nattack in before he blinks (he must an- \nnounce his intent before rolling the 2de for \nblink timing and the Id10 for initiative). In \nthis case, the caster compares the two dice \nrolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower \nthan his blink roll (the two rolls are not \nadded if he is trying to attack before he \nblinks). If so, he attacks according to his ini- \ntiative roll, then blinks according to the \nblink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his \ninitiative roll, however, he blinks out, then \nhe attacks in whatever direction he's facing \n(he must go through with his attack, even if \nhe is facing in the wrong direction to affect \nanyone). \nCldraudlencc (Divination) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe clairaudience spell enables the wizard \nto concentrate upon some locale and hear in \nhis mind any noise within a &foot radius \nof the spell's casting point. Distance is not a \nfactor, but the locale must be known-a \nplace familiar to the spellcaster or an obvi- \nous one (such as behind a door, around a \ncorner, in a copse of trees, etc.). Only \nsounds that are normally detectable by the \nwizard can be heard by use of this spell. \nLead sheeting or magical protections pre- \nvent the operation of the spell, and the wiz- \nard has some indication that the spell is so \nblocked. Note that it functions only on the \nwizard's current plane of existence. The \nspell creates an invisible sensor that can be \nmagically dispelled. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall horn of at least 100 gp value. \nClairvoyance (Mvination) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nSimilar to the clairaudience spell, the \nclairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to \nsee in his mind whatever is within sight \nrange from the spell locale chosen. Distance \nfrom the wizard is not a factor, but the lo- \ncale must be known-familiar or obvious. \nFurthermore, light is a factor, as the spell \ndoes not enable the use of infravision or \n147\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 148 | PDF_PAGE 149]\nWizard Spells (3rd Level) \nmagical enhancements. If the area is magi- \ncally dark, only darkness is seen; if natu- \nrally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from \nthe center of the spell’s area of effect can be \nseen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the \nnormal vision range according to the pre- \nvailing light. Lead sheeting or magical pro- \ntection foils a clairuoyance spell, and the \nwizard has some indication that it is so \nblocked. The spell creates an invisible sen- \nsor, similar to that created by a crystal ball \nspell, that can be dispelled. The spell func- \ntions only on the wizards current plane of \nexistence. \nThe material component is a pinch of \npowdered pineal gland. \nDelude (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of a delude spell, the wizard \nconceals his own alignment with that of any \ncreature within a 30-foot radius at the time \nthe spell is cast. The creature must be of \nhigher than animal intelligence for the spell \nto work; its own alignment remains un- \nchanged. The creature receives a saving \nthrow vs. spell and, if successful, the delude \nspell fails. If the spell is successful, any \nknow alignment spell used against the caster \ndiscovers only the assumed alignment. Note \nthat a detect good or detect evil also detects \nthe assumed aura, if the aura is strong \nenough. The creature whose aura has been \nassumed radiates magic, but the wizard ra- \ndiates magic only to the creature whose \nalignment has been assumed. If a delude \nspell is used in conjunction with a change \nself or alter self spell, the class of the wizard \ncan be totally hidden, if he is clever enough \nto carry off the disguise. \nDI-l Magic (Abjuration) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a wizard casts this spell, it has a \nchance to neutralize or negate magic it \ncomes in contact with, as follows: \nFirst, it removes spells and spell-like ef- \nfects (including device effects and innate \nabilities) from creatures or objects. Second, \nit disrupts the casting or use of these in the \narea of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. \nThird, it destroys magical potions (which \nare treated as 12th level for purposes of this \nspell). \nEach effect or potion in the spell’s area is \nchecked to determine if it is dispelled. The \ncaster can always dispel his own magic; oth- \nerwise the chance to dispel depends on the \ndifference in level between the magical ef- \nfect and the caster. The base chance is 50% \n(11 or higher on ldZ0 to dispel). If the caster \nis higher level than the creator of the effect \nto be dispelled, the difference is subtracted \nfrom the number needed on ld20 to dispel \n(thus making it more likely that the dispel \nsucceeds); if the caster is of lower level, then \nthe difference is added to the number \nneeded on Id20 to dispel (making it less \nlikely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 \nalways succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. \nThus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a \nroll of 1 prevents the effect from being dis- \npelled. \nA dispel magic spell does not affect a spe- \ncially enchanted item, such as a magical \nscroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous \nitem, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is \ncast directly upon the item. This renders the \nitem nonoperational for ld4 rounds. An \nitem possessed and carried by a creature \ngains the creature’s saving throw against \nthis effect, otherwise it is automatically ren- \ndered nonoperational. An interdimensional \ninterface (such as a bag of holding) rendered \nnonoperational would be temporarily \nclosed. Note that an item’s physical proper- \nties are unchanged: a nonoperational magi- \ncal sword is still a sword. \nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this \nspell; however, some of their spell-like ef- \nfects may be, at the DMs option. \nNote that this spell can be very effective \nwhen used upon charmed and similarly be- \nguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects \ncannot be dispelled; these are listed in the \nspell descriptions. \nExplosive Runes (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None or 1/2 \nBy tracing these mystic runes upon a \nbook, map, scroll, or similar object bearing \nwritten information, the wizard prevents \nunauthorized persons from reading his ma- \nterial. The explosive runes are difficult to \ndetect-5% chance per level of magic use \nexperience of the reader; thieves have only a \n5% chance. But trap detection by spell or \nmagical device always finds these runes. \nWhen read, the explosive runes detonate, \ndelivering 6d4 + 6 points of damage to the \nreader, who gets no saving throw. A like \namount, or half that if saving throws are \nmade, is suffered by each creature within \nthe blast radius. The wizard who cast the \nspell, as well as any he instructs, can read \nthe protected writing without triggering the \nrunes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the \nrunes whenever desired. Others can remove \nthem only with a successful dispel magic or \nerase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last \nuntil the spell is triggered. The item upon \nwhich the runes are placed is destroyed \nwhen the explosion takes place, unless it is \nnot normally subject to destruction by mag- \nical fire (see the Item Saving Throws in the \nDungeon Master’s Guide). \nSource of Effect \nCaster \nOther caster/innate ability \nWand \nStaff \nPotion \nOther magic \nArtif act \nSummary of Dakpel Magic Effects \nResists As Result of Dispel \nNone Dispel automatic \nLeveVHD of other caster \n6th level \n8th level \n12th level Potion destroyed \n12th. unless special * \nDM discretion DM discretion \nEffect negated \n* \n* Effect negated; if cast directly on item, item becomes nonoperational for ld4 rounds.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 149 | PDF_PAGE 150]\nWizard Spells (3rd Level) \nFeign Death (Necromancy) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster (or any \nother creature whose levels of experience or \nHit Dice do not exceed the wizards own \nlevel) can be put into a cataleptic state that is \nimpossible to distinguish from death. \nAlthough the person or creature affected by \nthe feign death spell can smell, hear, and \nknow what is going on, no feeling or sight of \nany sort is possible. Thus any wounding or \nmistreatment of the body is not felt and no \nreaction occurs; damage is only 1/z normal. \nIn addition, paralysis, poison, or energy- \nlevel drain cannot affect an individual under \nthe influence of this spell. Poison injected or \notherwise introduced into the body takes \neffect when the spell recipient is no longer \nunder the influence of this spell, although a \nsaving throw is permitted. \nNote that only a willing individual can be \naffected by feign death. The spellcaster can \nend the spell effects at any time desired, as \nwill a successful dispeI, but a full round is \nrequired for bodily functions to begin again. \nFireball (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 2Sfoot radius \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nA fireball is an explosive burst of flame, \nwhich detonates with a low roar and deliv- \ners damage proportional to the level of the \nwizard who cast it-ld6 points of damage \nfor each level of experience of the spellcaster \n(up to a maximum of 1Od6). The burst of the \nfireball creates little pressure and generally \nconforms to the shape of the area in which it \noccurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its \nnormal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 \ncubic feet-thirty-three 10' x 10' x 10' \ncubes). Besides causing damage to crea- \ntures, the fireball ignites all combustible \nmaterials within its burst radius, and the \nheat of the fireball melts soft metals such as \ngold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items \nrequire saving throws vs. magical fire to \ndetermine if they are affected, but items in \nthe possession of a creature that rolls a suc- \ncessful saving throw are unaffected by the \nfireball. \nThe wizard points his finger and speaks \nthe range (distance and height) at which the \nfireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the \npointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a \nmaterial body or solid barrier prior to \nattaining the prescribed range, blossoms \ninto the fireball (an early impact results in \nan early detonation). Creatures failing their \nsaving throws each suffer full damage from \nthe blast. Those who roll successful saving \nthrows manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll \naside, each receiving half damage (the DM \nrolls the damage and each affected creature \nsuffers either full damage or half damage \n[round fractions down], depending on \nwhether the creature saved or not). \nThe material component of this spell is a \ntiny ball of bat guano and sulphur. \nFlame Arrow (ConjuratiodSumrnoning) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell has two effects. First, the wiz- \nard can cause normal arrows or crossbow \nbolts to become magical flaming missiles for \none round. The missiles must be nocked and \ndrawn (or cocked) at the completion of the \nspell. If they are not loosed within one \nround, they are consumed by the magic. For \nevery five levels the caster has achieved, up \nto 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The \narrows inflict normal damage, plus 1 point \nof fire damage to any target struck. They \nmay also cause incendiary damage. This \nversion of the spell is used most often in \nlarge battles. \nThe second version of this spell enables \nthe caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents \nwithin range. Each bolt inflicts ld6 points of \npier- damage, plus 4d6 points of fire \ndamage. Only half of the fire damage is \ninflicted if the creature struck saves vs. \nspell. The caster receives one bolt for every \nfive experience levels (two bolts at 10th \nlevel, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be \nused on creatures within 20 yards of each \nother and in front of the wizard. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of oil and a small piece of flint. \nFly (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level + ld6 turns \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to bestow \nthe power of magical flight. The creature \naffected is able to move vertically and hor- \nizontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascend- \ning, twice that if descending in a dive). The \nmaneuverability class of the creature is B. \nUsing the fly spell requires as much concen- \ntration as walking, so most spells can be cast \n1 49 \nwhile hovering or moving slowly (move- \nment of 3). Possible combat penalties while \nflying are known to the DM (in the \"Aerial \nCombat\" section of the DMG). The exact \nduration of the spell is always unknown to \nthe spellcaster, as the variable addition 4 \ndetermined secretly by the DM. \nThe material component of the fly spell is \na wing feather \nGust of Wind (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot wide path, 10 \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a strong puff of air \noriginates from the wizard and moves in the \ndirection he is facing. The force of this gust \nof wind (about 30 m.p.h) is sufficient to \nextinguish candles, torches, and similar \nunprotected flames. It cauees protected \nflames-such as those of lantern-to dance \nwildly and has a 5% chance per level a) \nexperience of the spellcaster to extinguish \neven such lights. It also fans large fires out- \nward ld6 feet in the direction of the winds \nmovement. It form back small flying ara- \ntures ld6 x 10 yards and causes man-sbd \nbeings to be held motionless if attempting to \nmove against its force. It slows larger-than- \nman-sized flying creatures by 50% for one \nround. It blows over light objects, disperses \nmost vapors, and forces away gaseous or \nunsecured levitating creatures. Its path is 10 \nfeet wide by 10 yards long per level of expe- \nrience of the caster (e.g., an 8th-level wizard \ncauses a gust of wind that travels 80 yards). \nThe material component of the spell is a \nlegume seed. \nyarddlevel long \nHaste (Alteration) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, each affected crea- \nture functions at double its normal move- \nment and attack rates. A hasted creature \ngains a -2 initiative bonus. Thus, a crea- \nture moving at 6 and attacking once per \nround would move at 12 and attack twice \nper round. Spellcasting and spell effects are \nnot sped up. The number of creatures that \ncan be affected is equal to the caster's experi- \nence level; those creatures closest to the ten- \nter of effect are affected first. All affected by \nhaste must be in the designated area of \neffect. Note that this spell negates the effects \nDf a slow spell. Additionally, this spell ages\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 150 | PDF_PAGE 151]\nI1 Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nthe recipient by one year, because of sped- \nup metabolic processes. This spell is not cu- \nmulative with itself or with other similar \nmagic. \nIts material component is a shaving of lic- \norice root. \nHold Person (EnchantmenffCharm) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 persons in a \n20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell holds ld4 humans, demihu- \nmans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo- \nbile for five or more rounds. \nThe hold person spell affects any bipedal \nhuman, demihuman or humanoid of man- \nsize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, \ndwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, \nhalf-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, \nhumans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, ora, \npixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. \nThe spell is centered on a point selected \nby the caster; it affects persons selected by \nthe caster within the area of effect. If the \nspell is cast at three or four people, each gets \nan unmodified saving throw. If only two \npeople are being enspelled, each makes his \nsaving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell \nis cast at only one person, the saving throw \nsuffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are ad- \njusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on \ntheir saving throws are unaffected by the \nspell. Undead creatures cannot be held. \nHeld beings cannot move or speak, but \nthey remain aware of events around them \nand can use abilities not requiring motion or \nspeech. Being held does not prevent the \nworsening of the subjects' condition due to \nwounds, disease, or poison. The caster can \nend the spell with a single utterance at any \ntime; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at \n5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds \nat 7th level, etc. \nThe spellcaster needs a small, straight \npiece of iron as the material component of \n+his spell. \nHdd Undead (Necromancy) \nRange: 60' \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: ld3 undead \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen cast, this spell renders immobile \nld3 undead creatures whose total Hit Dice \nare equal to or less than the caster's level. No \nmore than three undead can be affected by a \nsingle spell. To cast, the wizard aims the \nspell at a point within range and the three \nundead closest to this are considered to be in \nthe area of effect, provided all are within the \nfield of vision and spell range of the caster. \nUndead of a mindless nature (skeletons, \nzombies, or ghouls) are automatically af- \nfected. Other forms of undead are allowed a \nsaving throw to negate the effect. If the spell \nis successful, it renders the undead immobile \nfor the duration of the spell. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of sulphur and powdered garlic. \nIllusionary Script (hsion/Phantasm) \nRange:,Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Creature reading the script \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to write in- \nstructions or other information on parch- \nment, paper, etc. The illusionary script \nappears to be some form of foreign or magi- \ncal writing. Only the person (or people) \nwho the wizard desires to read the writing \ncan do so. An illusionist recognizes it for il- \nlusionary script. \nUnauthorized creatures glancing at the \nscript must roll saving throws vs. spell. A \nsuccessful save means the creature can look \naway with only a mild sense of disorienta- \ntion. Failure means the creature is subject to \na suggestion implanted in the script by the \ncaster at the time the illusionary script was \ncast. The suggestion cannot require more \nthan three turns to carry out. The sugges- \ntion could be to close the book and leave, or \nto forget the existence of the book, for ex- \nample. A successful dispel magic spell will \nremove the illusionary script, but an unsuc- \ncessful attempt erases all of the writing. The \nhidden writings can be read by a combina- \ntion of the true seeing spell and either the \nread magic or comprehend languages spell, \nas applicable. \nThe material component is a lead-based \nink that requires special manufacture by an \nalchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp \nper usage. \nInfravision (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard enables \nthe recipient to see in normal darkness up to \n60 feet without light. Note that strong \nsources of light (fire, lanterns, torches, etc.) \ntend to blind this vision, so infravision does \nnot function efficiently in the presence of \nsuch light sources. Invisible creatures are \n1 50 \nnot detectable by infravision. \nther a pinch of dried carrot or an agate. \nThe material component of this spell is ei- \nInvisibility, 10' Radius \n(Iflusion/Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius of \ncreature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell confers invisibility upon all \ncreatures within 10 feet of the recipient. \nGear carried and light sources are included, \nbut any light emitted is still visible. The cen- \nter of the effect is mobile with the recipient. \nThose affected by this spell cannot see each \nother. Any affected creature moving out of \nthe area becomes visible, but creatures mov- \ning into the area after the spell is cast do not \nbecome invisible. Affected creatures (other \nthan the recipient) that attack negate the in- \nvisibility only for themselves. If the spell re- \ncipient attacks, the invisibility, 10' radius \nspell is broken for all. \nThe material components are the same as \nfor the inaisibility spell. \nItem (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 2 cu. ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within \nthe size limit) to 1/12 of its normal size. Op- \ntionally, the caster can also change its now- \nshrunken composition to a cloth-like one. \nAn object in the possession of another crea- \nture is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Ob- \njects changed by an item spell can be \nreturned to normal composition and size \nmerely by tossing them onto any solid sur- \nface or by a word of command from the \noriginal spellcaster. Note that even a burn- \ning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this \nspell.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 151 | PDF_PAGE 152]\nWizard Spells (3rd Level) \nTI Leomund's Tiny Hut (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours + 1 houdlevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1.5-footdiameter sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nan unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any \ndesired color around his person. Half of the \nsphere projects above the ground, and the \nlower hemisphere passes through the \nground. Up to seven other man-sized crea- \ntures can fit into the field with its creator, \nand these can freely pass into and out of the \nhut without harming it, but if the spellcaster \nremoves himself from it, the spell dissipates. \nThe temperature inside the hut is 70\" F, if \nthe exterior temperature is between 0\" and \n100\" E An exterior temperature below Oo or \nabove 100° lowers or raises, respectively, \nthe interior temperature on a Io-for-l0 \nbasis. The tiny hut also provides protection \nagainst the elements, such as rain, dust, \nsandstorms, and the like. The hut can with- \nstand any wind of less than hurricane force \nwithout being harmed, but wind force \ngreater than that destroys it. \nThe interior of the hut is a hemisphere; \nthe spellcaster can illuminate it dimly upon \ncommand, or extinguish the light as desired. \nNote that although the force field is opaque \nfrom the outside, it is transparent from \nwithin. Missiles, weapons, and most spell \neffects can pass through the hut without \naffecting it, although the occupants cannot \nbe seen from outside the hut. The hut can be \ndispelled. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall crystal bead that shatters when the \nspell duration expires or the hut is dispelled. \nLightning Bolt (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard \nreleases a powerful stroke of electrical \nenergy that inflicts ld6 points of damage per \nlevel of the spellcaster (maximum damage of \n1Od6) to each creature within its area of \neffect. A successful saving throw vs. spell \nreduces this damage to half (round fractions \ndown). The bolt begins at a range and \nheight decided by the caster and streaks out- \nward in a direct line from the casting wizard \n(e.g., if a *foot bolt was started at 180 feet \nfrom the wizard, the far end of bolt would \nreach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt \nmay set fire to combustibles, sunder wood- \nen doors, splinter up to % foot thickness of \nstone, and melt metals with a low melting \npoint (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). \nSaving throws must be rolled for objects \nthat withstand the full force of a stroke (see \nthe fireball spell). If the damage caused to an \ninterposing barrier shatters or breaks \nthrough it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the \nbolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch \nof wood or 112 inch of stone per caster level \nup to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/z \nfoot of stone. \nThe lightning bolt's area of effect is cho- \nsen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt \n10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt \nfive feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt can- \nnot reach its full length, because of an \nunyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the \nlightning bolt rebounds from the barrier \ntoward its caster, ending only when it reach- \nes its full length. \nExample: An 80-foot-long stroke is \nbegun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone \nwall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits \nthe wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back \ntoward its creator (who is only 50 feet from \nthe wall, and so is caught in his own light- \nning bolt!). \nThe DM might allow reflecting bolts. \nWhen this type of lightning bolt strikes a \nsolid surface, the bolt reflects from the sur- \nface at an angle equal to the angle of inci- \ndence (like light off a mirror). A creature \ncrossed more than once by the bolt must roll \na saving throw for every time it is crossed, \nbut it still suffers either full damage (if one \nsaving throw is missed) or half damage (if \nall saving throws are made). \nThe material components of the spell are \na bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass \nrod. \nMelf's Minute Meteors \n(Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 70 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 target per meteor \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to cast small \nglobes of fire (one for each experience level \nhe has attained), each of which bursts into a \none-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, \ninflicting ld4 points of damage to the crea- \nture struck. It can also ignite combustible \nmaterials (even solid planks). The meteors \nue treated as missiles hurled by the wizard \nNith a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with \nIO penalty for range. Misses are treated as \np-enade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of \niamage to creatures within three feet. \nThe spell can be cast in either of two \nvays: \nA) The wizard discharges five meteors \nvery round (see the \"Multiple Attacks and \nInitiative\" section, page 95). Note that this \ncarries over into at least the following \nround. \nB) The wizard discharges only one meteor \nper round. In addition to releasing the mis- \nsile, the caster can perform other actions in \nthe round, including spellcasting, melee, or \ndevice use. Spells requiring concentration \nforce the wizard to forgo the rest of the mb \ndes to maintain concentration. Also, if the \nwizard fails to maintain an exact mental \ncount of the number of missiles he has \nremaining, he has involuntarily lost the \nremaining portion of the spell. \nThe spell ends when the caster has fired \noff as many meteors as he has experience \nlevels, when he forgoes casting any still \nremaining, or when a successful dispel mag- \nic spell is thrown upon the caster. \nThe components necessary for the casting \nof this spell are nitre and sulphur formed \ninto a bead by the addition of pine tar. The \ncaster must also have a small hollow tube of \nminute proportion, fashioned from gold. \nThe tube costs no less than 1,OOO gp to con- \nstruct, so fine is its workmanahip and magi- \ncal engraving, and it can be reused. \nMonster Summ \n(ConjuraHonBu \nRange: 30 yards \n'Componeqts: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWithin one round of casting this spell, the \nwizard magically conjures 2d4 1st-level \nmonsters (selected by the DM, from his ld- \nlevel encounter tables). The monsters \nappear in an area within the spell range, as \ndesired by the wizard. They attack the spell \nuser's opponents to the best of their ability \nuntil either he commands that the attacks \ncease, the spell duration expires, or the \nmonsters are slain. These creatures do not \ncheck morale, but they vanish when slain. \nNote that if no opponent exists to fight, \nsummoned monsters can, if the wizard can \ncommunicate with them and if they are \nphysically able, perform other services for \nthe summoning wizard. \nIn rare cases, adventurers have been \nknown to disappear, summoned by power- \nful spellcasters using this spell. Those sum- \nmoned recall all the details of their trip. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \n151\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 152 | PDF_PAGE 153]\nWizard Spells (3rd Level) 1 \nNon-Detection (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or item \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard makes the \ncreature or object touched undetectable by \ndivination spells such as clairuudience, \nclairvoyance, locate object, ESP, and detect \nspells. It also prevents location by such \nmagical items as crystal balls and ESP me- \ndallions. It does not affect the know align- \nment spell or the ability of intelligent or \nhigh-level beings to detect invisible crea- \ntures. If a divination is attempted, the non- \ndetection caster must roll a saving throw vs. \nspell. If this is successful, the divination \nfails. \nThe material component of the spell is a \npinch of diamond dust worth 300 gp. \nPhantom Steed (Conjuration, Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \na quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed \ncan be ridden only by the wizard who cre- \nated it, or by any person for whom the wiz- \nard specifically creates such a mount. A \nphantom steed has a black head and body, \ngray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, in- \nsubstantial hooves that make no sound. Its \neyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, \nbut all normal animals shun it and only \nmonstrous ones will attack. The mount has \nan Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 \nper level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit \npoints, the phantom steed disappears. A \nphantom steed moves at a movement rate of \n4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum \nmovement rate of 48. It has what seems to \nbe a saddle and a bit and bridle. It can bear \nits rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per \ncaster level. \nThese mounts gain certain powers ac- \ncording to the level of the wizard who cre- \nated them: \n8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy, \nmuddy, or even swampy ground without \ndifficulty. \n10th Level: The ability to pass over water \nas if it were firm, dry ground. \n12th Level: The ability to travel in the air \nas if it were firm land, so chasms and the like \ncan be crossed without benefit of a bridge. \nNote, however, that the mount cannot casu- \nally take off and fly; the movement must be \nbetween points of similar altitude. \n14th Level: The ability to perform as if it \nwere a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per \nround upon command. \nNote that a mount's abilities include those \nof lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has \nthe 8th-, loth-, and 12th-level abilities. \nProtection From Evil, 10' Radius \n(Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounddevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThe globe of protection of this spell is \nidentical in all respects to a protection from \nevil spell, except that it encompasses a much \nlarger area and its duration is greater. The \neffect is centered on and moves with the \ncreature touched. Any protected creature \nwithin the circle can break the warding \nagainst enchanted or summoned monsters \nby meleeing them. If a creature too large to \nfit into the area of effect is the recipient of \nthe spell, the spell acts as a normal protec- \ntion from evil spell for that creature only. \nTo complete this spell, the caster must \ntrace a circle 20 feet in diameter using pow- \ndered silver. The material component for \nthe reverse is powdered iron. \naround creature touched \nProtection From Normal Misslles \n(Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turnllevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard bestows \ntotal invulnerability to hurled and projected \nmissiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, jave- \nlins, small stones, and spears. Furthermore, \nit causes a reduction of 1 from each die of \ndamage (but no die inflicts less than 1 point \nof damage) inflicted by large or magical \nmissiles, such as ballista missiles, catapult \nstones, hurled boulders, and magical ar- \nrows, bolts, javelins, etc. Note, however, \nthat this spell does not convey any protec- \ntion from such magical attacks as fireballs, \nlightning bolts, or magic missiles. \nThe material component of this spell is a \npiece of tortoise or turtle shell. \n152 \nSecret \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Until dispelled \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 page of any size, \nSaving Throw: None \nup to 2 ft. square \nWhen cast, a secret page spell alters the \nactual contents of a page so that they appear \nto be something entirely different. Thus a \nmap can be changed to become a treatise on \nburnishing ebony walking sticks. The text \nof a spell can be altered to show a ledger \npage or even another form of spell. Confuse \nlanguages and explosive runes spells may be \ncast upon the secret page, but a comprehend \nlanguages spell cannot reveal the secret \npage's contents. The caster is able to reveal \nthe original contents by speaking a com- \nmand word, perusing the actual page, and \nthen returning it to its secret page form. The \ncaster can also remove the spell by double \nrepetition of the command word. Others \nnoting the dim magic of a page with this \nspell cloaking its true contents can attempt \nto dispel magic, but if it fails, the page is de- \nstroyed. A true seeing spell does not reveal \nthe contents unless cast in combination with \na comprehend lunguages spell. An eruse \nspell can destroy the writing. \nThe material components are powdered \nherring scales and either will 0' wisp or bog- \ngart essence. \nSepia Snake Sigli \n(ConjuratiodSumrnoning) \nRange: 5 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 sigil \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a small written \nsymbol appears in the text of any written \nwork. When read, the so-called sepia snake \nsprings into being and strikes at the nearest \nliving creature (but does not attack the wiz- \nard who cast the spell). Its attack is made as \nif it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to \nthe level of the wizard who cast the spell. If \nit strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed \nin a shimmering amber field of force, frozen \nand immobilized until released, either at the \ncaster's command, by a successful dispel \nmagic spell, or until a time equal to ld4 days \n+ 1 day per caster level has elapsed. Until \nthen, nothing can get at the victim, move \nthe shimmering force surrounding him, or \notherwise affect him. The victim does not \nage, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells \nwhile in this state. He is not aware of his sur- \nroundings.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 153 | PDF_PAGE 154]\nWizard Spells (3rd Level) -- \nIf the sepia snake misses its target, it dissi- \npates in a flash of brown light, with a loud \nnoise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that \nis 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one \nround. \nThe spell cannot be detected by normal \nobservation, and detect magic reveals only \nthat the entire text is magical. A dispel mag- \nic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the \nentire page of text. It can be cast in combina- \ntion with other spells that hide or garble \ntext. \nThe components for the spell are 100 gp \nworth of powdered amber, a scale from any \n' cube, 1 creature/level \naving Throw: Neg. \nA slow spell causes affected creatures to \nve and attack at 1/z of their normal rates. \ntes a haste spell or equivalent, but \nnot otherwise affect magically speeded \nslowed creatures. Slowed creatures have \ncenter of the spell outward. Saving \nws against the spell suffer a -4 penalty. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nSpectral Force (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 60 yards + 1 yard/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 40' cube + a 10' cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe spectral force spell creates an illusion \nin which sound, smell, and thermal illusions \nare included. It is otherwise similar to the \nimproved phantusrnal force spell. The spell \nlast for three rounds after concentration \nceases. \nkrggcstioa (Enrhanme!nKh) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast by the wizard, he \ninfluences the actions of the chosen recipient \nby the utterance of a few words-phrases or \na sentence or two-suggesting a course of \naction desirable to the spellcaster. The crea- \nture to be influenced must, of course, be \nable to understand the wizards sug- \ngestion-it must be spoken in a language \nthat the spell recipient understands. \nThe suggestion must be worded in such a \nmanner as to make the action sound reason- \nable; asking the creature to stab itself, \nthrow itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or \ndo some other obviously harmful act auto- \nmatically negates the effect of the spell. \nHowever, a suggestion that a pool of acid \nwas actually pure water and that a quick dip \nwould be refreshing is another matter. Urg- \ning a red dragon to stop attacking the wiz- \nards party so that the dragon and party \ncould jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere \nis likewise a reasonable use of the spelI's \npower. \nThe course of action of a suggestion can \ncontinue in effect for a considerable dura- \ntion, such as in the case of the red dragon \nmentioned above. Conditions that will trig- \nger a special action can also be specified; if \nthe condition is not met before the spell \nexpires, then the action will not be per- \nformed. If the target successfully rolls its \nsaving throw, the spell has no effect. Note \nthat a very reasonable suggestion causes the \nsaving throw to be made with a penalty \n(such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of \nthe Dungeon Master. Undead are not sub- \nject to suggestion. \nThe material components of this spell are \na snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- \ncomb or a drop of sweet oil. \nTongues (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to speak and \nunderstand additional languages, whether \nthey are racial tongues or regional dialects. \nThis does not enable the caster to speak with \nanimals. The spell enables the caster to be \nunderstood by all creatures of that type \nwithin hearing distance, usually 60 feet. \nThis spell does not predispose the subject \ntoward the caster in any way. \nThe wizard can speak one additional \ntongue for every three levels of experience. \nThe reverse of the spell cancels the effect of \nthe tongues spell or confuses verbal com- \nmunication of any sort within the area of \neffect. \nThe material component is a small day \nmodel of a ziggurat, which shatters when \nthe spell is pronounced. \nVampiric Touch (Necromancy) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: One touch \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the caster touches an opponent in \nmelee with a successful attack roll, the \nopponent loses Id6 hit points for every two \ncaster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for \na 12th-level caster. The spell is expended \nwhen a successful touch is made or one turn \npasses. The hit points are added to the cast- \ner's total, with any hit points over the cast- \ner's normal total treated as temporary \nadditional hit points. Any damage to the \ncaster is subtracted from the temporary hit \npoints first. After one hour, any extra hit \npoints above the caster's normal total are \nlost. The creature originally losing hit \npoints through this spell can regain them by \nmagical or normal healing. Undead mea- \ntures are unaffected by this spell. \nl \nWater Breathing (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level + ld4 hours \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe recipient of a water breathing spell is \nable to breathe water freely for the duration \nof the spell. The caster can touch more than \none creature with a single casting; in this \ncase the duration is divided by the number \nof creatures touched. The reverse, air \nbreathing, enables water-breathing ma- \ntures to comfortably survive in the atmos- \nphere for an equal duration. \nThe material commnent of the spell is a \nshort reed or piece 01 straw.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 154 | PDF_PAGE 155]\nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nWind Wall (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: A 10’ wide x 5‘ high area \nper caster level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell brings forth an invisible vertical \ncurtain of wind two feet thick and of consid- \nerable strength-a strong breeze sufficient \nto blow away any bird smaller than an eagle \nor to tear papers and like materials from \nunsuspecting hands. (If in doubt, a saving \nthrow vs. spell determines whether the sub- \nject maintains its grasp.) Normal insects \ncannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, \neven cloth garments, fly upward when \ncaught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are \ndeflected upward and miss, while sling \nstones and other missiles under two pounds \nin weight receive a -4 penalty to a first shot \nand -2 penalties thereafter. Gases, most \nbreath weapons, and creatures in gaseous \nform cannot pass this wall, although it is no \nbarrier to noncorporeal creatures. \nThe material components are a tiny fan \nand a feather of exotic origin. \nWalthform (Alteration, Illusion) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard and all \nof his gear become insubstantial. The caster \nis subject only to magical or special attacks, \nincluding those by weapons of + 1 or better, \nor by creatures otherwise able to affect \nthose struck only by magical weapons. \nUndead of most sorts will ignore an individ- \nwl in wraithform, believing him to be a \nwraith or spectre, though a lich or special \nundead may save vs. spell with a - 4 penal- \nty to recognize the spell. \nThe wizard can pass through small holes \nor narrow openings, even mere cracks, with \nall he wears or holds in his hands, as long as \nthe spell persists. Note, however, that the \nthe caster cannot fly without additional \nmagic. No form of attack is possible when in \nwraithform, except against creatures that \nexist on the Ethereal plane, where all attacks \n(both ways) are nod. A successful dispel \nmagic spell forces the wizard in wraithform \nback to normal form. The spellcaster can \nend the spell with a single word. \nThe material components for the spell are \na bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke. \nii if!! \nI \nFourth-Level Spells \nCharm Monster (EnchantmentKhann) \nwe: 60 yards \nZomponents: V, S \nhation: Special \nZasting Time: 4 \n4rea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 20- \nfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is similar to a charm person \n;pell, but it can affect any living creature- \n)r several low-level creatures. The spell \nlffects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, \ndthough it only affects one creature of 4 or \n154 \nmore Hit Dice or levels, regardks of the \nnumber rolled. \nAll possible subjects receive saving \nthrows vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any \ndamage inflicted by the caster or his allies in \nthe round of casting grants the wounded \ncreature another saving throw at a bonus of \n+1 per point of darnage dved. Any \naffected creature regards the spellcaster as \nfriendly, an ally or companion to be treated \nwell or guarded from harm. If communica- \ntion is possible, the charmed creature fd- \nlows reasonable requests, instructium, or \norders most faithfully (see the suggestion \nspell). If communication is not possible, the \ncreature does not harm the caster, but others \nin the vicinity may be subject to its inten- \ntions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hos- \ntile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at \nthe very least allows a new saving throw \nagainst the charm.

Those \nwho fail are checked by the DM for actions \neach round for the duration of the spell, or \nuntil the ”wander away for the duration of \nthe spell“ result occurs. \nWandering creatures move as far from the \ncaster as possible, according to their most \ntypical mode of movement (characters \nwalk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving \nthrows and actions are checked at the begin- \nning of each round. Any confused creature \nthat is attacked perceives the attacker as an \nenemy and acts according to its basic \nnature. \nIf there are many creatures involved, the \nDM may decide to assume average results. \nFor example, if there are 16 orcs affected \nand 25% could be expected tb make the sav- \ning throw, then four are ashmed to have \nsucceeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders \naway, four attack the nearest creature, six \nstand confused, and the last acts normally \nbut must check next round. Since the ora \nare not near the party, the DM decides that \ntwo attacking the nearest creature attack \neach other, one attacks an orc that saved, \nand one attacks a confused orc, which \nstrikes back. The next round, the base is 11 \nora, since four originally saved and one \nwandered off. Another one wanders off, \nfive stand confused, four attack, and one \nacts normally. \nThe material component is a set of three \nnut shells. \nContaglon (Necromancy) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell causes a major disease and \nweakness in a creature. The afflicted indi- \nvidual is immediately stricken with painful \nand distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, \nlesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. \nStrength, Dexterity, and Charisma are \nreduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by \n2. The effect persists until the character \nreceives a cure diseuse spell or spends Id3 \nweeks taking a complete rest to recover. \nCharacters ignoring the contagion for more \nthan a day or so may be susceptible to worse \ndiseases at the discretion of the DM. \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nDetect Scrying (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld6 turns + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 120-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard imme- \ndiately becomes aware of any attempt to \nobserve him by means of clairvoyance, \nclairaudience, or magic mirror. This also \nreveals the use of crystal balls or other magi- \ncal scrying devices, provided the attempt is \nwithin the area of effect of the spell. Since \nthe spell is centered on the spellcaster, it \nmoves with him, enabling him to “sweep” \nareas for the duration of the spell. \nWhen a scrying attempt is detected, the \nscryer must immediately roll a saving \nthrow. If this is faild, the identity and gen- \neral location of the scryer immediately \nbecome known to the wizard who cast this \nspell. The general location is a direction and \nsignificant landmark close to the scryer. \nThus, the caster might learn, ’The wizard \nSniggel spies on us from east, under the \nstairs,” or, ‘You are watched by Asquil in the \ncity of Samarquol.” \nThe material components for this spell are \na small piece of mirror and a miniature brass \nhearing trumpet. \nDig (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 5-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nA dig spell enables the caster to excavate \n125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per \nround (i.e., a cubic hole five feet on a side). \nIn later rounds the caster can expand an \nexisting hole or start a new one. The materi- \nal thrown from the excavation scatters \nevenly around the pit. If the wizard con- \ntinues downward past 20 feet in earth, there \nis a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This \ncheck is made for every five feet dug beyond \n20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, \nmud fills in and collapses after five feet, and \nquicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug. \nAny creature at the edge (within one foot) \nof a pit must roll a successful Dexterity \ncheck or fall into the hole. Creatures mov- \ning rapidly toward a pit dug immediately \nbefore them must roll a saving throw vs. \nspell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a \npit being excavated can climb out at a rate \ndecided by the DM. A creature caught in a \ncollapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. \ndeath to avoid being buried; it escapes the \npit if successful. Tunneling is possible with \nthis spell as long as there is space available \n155 \nm \nfor the material removed. Chances for \nlapse are doubled and safe tunneling \ntance is half of the safe excavation d \nunless such construction is most carefully \nbraced and \nof earth and rock, particularly clay golems \nand those from the elemental plane of Earth. \nWhen cast upon such a creature, it suffers \n4d6 points of damage. A successful saving \nthrow vs. spell reduces this damage to half. \nTo activate the spell, the spellcaster needs \na miniature shovel and tiny bucket and \nmust contii \nexcavated. \nconclusion of the spell. \nDimension Door (AI \nRange: 0 \nComponen \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nwizard instantly transfers himself up to 30 \nyards distance per level of experience. This \nspecial form of teleportation allows for no \nerror, and the wizard always arrives at \nexactly the spot desired-whether by sim- \nply visualizing the area (within spell tranda \ndistance, of course) or by stating direction \nsuch as, ”300 yards straight downward: or, \n“upward to the northwest, 45 degree angle, \n420 yards.” If the wizard arrives in a place \nthat is already occupied by a solid body, he \nremains trapped in the Astral plane. If dis- \ntances are stated and the spellcaster arrives \nwith no sui \nair), falling \nmagical means are employed. All that the \nwizard wears or carries, subject to a maxi- \nmum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliv- - \ning matter, or half that amount of living \nmatter, is transferred with the spellcaster. \nRecovery from use of a dimension door \nspell requires one round. ~ \nEmotion (Ench.ntment/Charm) \nThe spell .. \nBy means of a dimension \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 2O-fwt cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can cre- \nate a single emotional reaction in the subject \ncreatures. The following are typical: \n1. Courage: This emotion causes the \ncreatures affected to become berserk, fight- \ning with a + 1 bonus to the attack dice, caw \ning +3 points of damage, and temporarily \ngaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight \nwithout shield, and regardless of life, never I\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 156 | PDF_PAGE 157]\n1\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 157 | PDF_PAGE 158]\nchecking morale. This spell counters (and is \ncountered by) fear. \n2. FeaT: The affected creatures flee in \npanic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is \ncountered by) couruge. \n3. Friendship: The affected creatures \nreact more positively (e.g., tolerance \nbecomes goodwill). It counters (and is coun- \ntered by) hate. \n4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and \na feeling of complacent well-being, adding \n+4 to all reaction rolls and making attack \nunlikely unless the creatures are subject to \nextreme provocation. It counters (and is \ncountered by) sadness. \n5. Hate: The affected creatures react \nmore negatively (e.g., tolerance becomes \nnegative neutrality). It counters (and is \ncountered by) friendship. \n6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise \nmorale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and \ndamage caused by +2. It counters (and is \ncountered by) hopelessness. \n7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures \nsubmit to the demands of any opponent: \nsurrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the crea- \ntures are 25% likely to do nothing in a \nround, and 25% likely to turn back or \nretreat. It counters (and is countered by) \nhope. \n8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and \na tendency toward maudlin introspection. \nThis emotion increases chances of being sur- \nprised by - 1 and adds + 1 to initiative rolls. \nIt counters (and is countered by) happiness. \nAll creatures in the area at the instant the \nspell is cast are affected unless successful \nsaving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted \nfor Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the \nwizard continues to concentrate on project- \ning the chosen emotion. Those who fail the \nsaving throw against fear must roll a new \nsaving throw if they return to the affected \narea. \nEnchanted Weapon (Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Weapon(s) touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell turns an ordinary weapon into \na magical one. The weapon is the equivalent \nof a +1 weapon, with +1 to attack and \ndamage rolls. Thus arrows, axes, bolts, \nbows, daggers, hammers, maces, spears, \nswords, etc., can be made into temporarily \nenchanted weapons. Two small (arrows, \nbolts, daggers, etc.) or one large (axe, bow, \nhammer, mace, etc.) weapon can beaffected \nby the spell. The spell functions on existing \nmagical weapons as long as the total com- \nbined bonus is +3 or less. \nMissile weapons enchanted in this way \nlose their enchantment when they success- \nfully hit a target, but otherwise the spell \nlasts its full duration. This spell is often used \nin combination with the enchant un item \nand permanency spells to create magical \nweapons, with this spell beii cast once per \ndesired plus of the bonus. \nThe material components of this spell are \npowdered lime and carbon. \nEnervation (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: ld4 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell temporarily suppresses the sub- \nject’s life force. The necromancer points his \nfinger and utters the incantation, releasing a \nblack bolt of crackling energy. The subject \nmust roll a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted \nfor Dexterity, to avoid the bolt. Success \nmeans the spell has no effect. Failure means \nthe subject is treated exactly as if he had \nbeen drained of energy levels by a wight, \none level for every four levels of the caster. \nHit Dice, spells, and other character details \ndependent on level are lost or reduced. \nThose drained to 0th level must make a sys- \ntem shock check to survive and are helpless \nuntil the spell expires. The spell effect even- \ntually wears off, either after ld4 hours plus \none hour per caster level, or after six hours \nof complete and undisturbed rest. Level \nabilities are regained, but lost spells must be \nrememorized. Undead are immune to this \nspell. \nEvard’s Black Tentacles \n(ConjuratiodSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 30 sq. ft./levei \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates many rubbery, black \ntentacles in the area of effect. These waving \nmembers seem to spring forth from the \nearth, floor, or whatever surface is \nunderfoot-including water. Each tentacle \nis 10 feet long, AC 4, and requires as many \npoints of damage to destroy as the level of \nthe wizard who cast the spell. There are ld4 \nsuch tentacles, plus one per experience level \nof the spellcaster. \nAny creature within range of the writhing \ntentacles is subject to attack as determined by \nthe DM. The target of a tentacle attack must \nroll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, \nthe subject suffers Id4 points of damage from \ncontact with the tentacle, and then the tentacle \nis destroyed. Failure to save indicates that the \ndamage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon mem- \nber is wrapped around its subj&, and damage \nwill be 3d4 points on the second and 8ucoeEd- \ning rounds. Since these tentacles have no in& \nthat they entwine any ow-a tree, post, pil- \nlar, even the wizard himself-or continue to \nsqueeze a dead opponent. A grasping hokl \nestablished by a tentacle remains until the ten- \ntacle is destroyed by some form of attack or \nuntil it disappears at theend ofthe spell’s dura- \ntion. \nThe component for this spell is a piece of \ntentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid. \nligence to guide them, there is the possibility \nExtension I (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Mect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of an extension I spell, the wizard \nprolongs the duration of a previously cast \n1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell by 50%. Thus, \na levitation spell can be made to function 15 \nminutedlevel, a hold person spell made to \nwork for three rounds/level, etc. Naturally, \nthe spell affects only spells that have dura- \ntions. This spell must be cast immediately \nafter the spell to be extended, either by the \noriginal caster or another wizard. If a com- \nplete round or more elapses, the extension \nfails and is wasted. \nFeu (IlIusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 60’ long cone, 30’ diameter \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nat end, 5’ at base \nWhen a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends \nforth an invisible cone of terror that causes \ncreatures within its area of effect to turn \naway from the caster and flee in panic. \nAffected creatures are likely to drop what- \never they are holding when struck by the \nspell: the base chance of this is 60% at 1st \nlevel (or at 1 Hit Die), and each level (or Hit \nDie) above this reduces the probability by \n5 % . Thus at 10th level there is only a 15 % \nchance, and at 13th level no chance, of \ndropping items. Creatures affected by fear \nflee at their fastest rate for a number of \nmelee rounds equal to the level of experi- \nence of the spellcaster. Undead and crea- \ntures that successfully roll their saving \nthrows vs. the spell are not affected. \nThe material component of this spell is \neither the heart of a hen or a white feather. \n157\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 158 | PDF_PAGE 159]\nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nfire Charm @nchanhnent/Charm) \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot radius of fire \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell the wizard causes a \nnormal fire source, such as a brazier, flam- \nbeau, or bonfire, to serve as a magical \nagent, for from this source he causes a gos- \nsamer veil of multi-hued flame to encircle \nthe fire at five feet distance. Any creatures \nobserving the fire or the dancing circle of \nflame around it must successfully roll a sav- \ning throw vs. spell or be charmed into \nremainii motionless and gazing, trans- \nfixed, at the flames. While so charmed, \ncreatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or \nfewer words, saving vs. spell with a - 3 pen- \nalty, adjusted for Wisdom. The caster can \ngive one such suggestion to each creature, \nand the suggestions need not be the same. \nThe maximum duration for such a sugges- \ntion is one hour, regardless of the caster’s \nlwel. \nThe fire charm is broken if the charmed \ncreature is physically attacked, if a solid \nobject comes between the creature and the \nveil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or \nwhen the duration of the spell expires. \nThose exposed to the fire charm again may \nbe affected at the DMs option, although \nbonuses may also be allowed to the saving \nthrows. Note that the veil of flame is not a \nmagical fire, and passing through it incurs \nthe same damage as would be sustained \nfrom passing through its original fire \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall piece of multi-colored silk of excep- \ntional thinness that the spellcaster must \nthrow into the fire source. \nRange: 10 yards \nsource. \nFire Shield (Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCastinn Time: 4 \n. Area 01 ~ect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast in one of two \nforms: a warm shield that protects against \ncold-based attacks, or a chill shield that pro- \ntects against fire-based attacks. Both return \ndamage to creatures making physical \nattacks against the wizard. The wizard must \nchoose which variation he memorizes when \nthe spell is selected. \nWhen casting this spell, the wizard \nappears to immolate himself, but the flames \nare thin and wispy, shedding no heat, \nthough giving light equal to only half the \nillumination of a normal torch. The color of \nthe flames is determined randomly (50% \nchance of either color)-blue or green if the \nchill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm \nshield is employed. The special powers of \neach shield are as follows: \nA) Warm shield. The flames are warm to \nthe touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved \nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal \ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is \nno bonus against fire-based attacks, but if \nthe wizard fails to make the required saving \nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains \ndouble normal damage. \nThe material component for this varia- \ntion is a bit of phosphorus. \nB) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the \ntouch. Any fire-based attacks are saved \nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal \ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is \nno bonus against cold-based attacks, but if \nthe wizard fails to make the required saving \nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains \ndouble normal damage. \nThe material component for this varia- \ntion is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail \nportions of four dead ones. \nAny creature striking the spellcaster with \nits body or hand-held weapons inflicts nor- \nmal damage upon the wizard, but the \nattacker suffers the same amount of dam- \nage. An attacker‘s magical resistance, if any, \nis tested when the creature actually strikes \nthe wizard. Successful resistance shatters \nthe spell. Failure means the creature’s magic \nresistance does not affect that casting of the \nSpell. \nFlre map (Abjuration, Evocation) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until discharged \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Object touched \nSaving Throw: 112 \nAny closeable item (book, box, bottle, \nchest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so \nforth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The \nspell is centered on a point selected by the \nspellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have \na second closure or warding spell placed \nupon it (if such is attempted, the result is \n25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails, \nor 50% both spells fail). A knock spell does \nnot afkct a fire trap in any way-as soon as \nthe offending party enters or touches the \nitem, the trap discharges. Thieves and oth- \ners have only 1/2 of their normal chance to \ndetect a fire trap (by noticing the character- \nistic markings required to cast the spell). \nThey have only 1h their normal chance to \nmove the trap (failure detonates the trap \nimmediately). An unsuccessful dispel does \nnot detonate the spell. The caster can use the \ntrapped object without discharging it, as \ncan any individual to whom the sue11 was \nspecifically attuned when cast (the exact \nmethod usually involves a keyword). When \nthe trap is discharged, there is an explosion \nof five-foot radius from the spell’s center; all \ncreatures within this area must roll saving \nthrows vs. spell. Damage is ld4 points plus \n1 point per level of the caster; half this \n(round up) for creatures successfully saving. \n(Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage \nand creates a large cloud of steam.) The item \ntrapped is not harmed by this explosion. \nTo place this spell, the caster must trace \nthe outline of the closure with a bit of sul- \nphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the \neffect. Attunement to another individual \nrequires a hair or similar object from that \nperson. \nFumble (EnchantmenKharm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a fumble spell is cast, the wizard \ncreates an area in which all creatures sud- \ndenly become clumsy and awkward. Run- \nning creatures trip and fall, those reaching \nfor an item drop it, those employing weap- \nons likewise awkwardly drop them, etc. \nRecovery from a fall or to pick up a fumbled \nobject typically requires a successful saving \nthrow and takes one round. Note that \nbreakable items might suffer damage when \ndropped. A subject succeeding with his sav- \ning throw can act freely that round, but if he \nis in the area at the beginning of the next \nround, another saving throw is required. \nAlternatively, the spell can be cast at an \nindividual creature. Failure to save means \nthe creature is affected for the spell’s entire \nduration; success means the creature is \nslowed (see the 3rd-level spell). \nThe material component of this spell is a \ndab of solidified milk fat. \nHdluclnatory Terrdn \n(IUusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Cube up to 30’ per side/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes \nan illusion that hides the actual terrain with- \nin the area of effect. Thus open fields or a \nroad can be made to look like a swamp, hill, \ncrevasse, or some other difficult or impass- \nable terrain. A pond can be made to look \nlike a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a \ngentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to \n1\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 159 | PDF_PAGE 160]\nlook like a wide and smooth road. The hal- \nlucinatory terrain persists until a dispel \nmagic spell is cast upon the area or until the \nduration expires. Individual creatures may \nsee through the illusion, but the illusion per- \nsists, affecting others who observe the \nscene. \nIf the illusion involves only a subtle \nchange, such as causing an open wood to \nappear thick and dark, or increasing the \nslope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed \neven by those in the midst of it. If the change \nis extreme, a grassy plain covering a seeth- \ning field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, \nthe illusion will no doubt be noticed the \ninstant one person falls prey to it. Each level \nof experience expands the dimensions of the \narea affected, e.g., a '12th-level caster affects \na 120 yd. x 120 yd. x 120 yd. area. \nThe material components of this spell are \na stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant- \nleaf or grass blade. \nIce Storm (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can have one of two effects, at \nthe caster's option: Either great hail stones \npound down for one round in a 40-foot- \ndiameter area and inflict 3d10 points of \ndamage to any creatures within the area of \neffect, or driving sleet falls in an 80-foot- \ndiameter area for one round per caster level. \nThe sleet blinds creatures within its area for \nthe duration of the spell and causes the \n. ground in the area to be icy, thus slowing \n: movement by 50% and making it 50% \nprobable that a creature trying to move in \nthe area slip and falls. The sleet also extin- \nguishes torches and small fires. \nNote that this spell will negate a heat \nmetal spell. \nThe material components for this spell are \na pinch of dust and a few drops of water. \nliiudonary Waii (IIlusionPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1' x 10' x 10' \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates the illusion of a wall, \nfloor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is \npermanent until dispelled. It appears abso- \nlutely real when viewed, even magically, as \nwith the clerical spell, true seeing, or its \nequivalent, but physical objects can pass \nthrough it without difficulty. When the spell \nis used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, \nnormal demihuman and magical detection \nabilities work normally, and touch or prob- \ning searches reveal the true nature of the \nsurface, though they do not cause the illu- \nsion to disappear. \nThe material component is a rare dust \nthat costs at least 400 gp and requires four \ndays to prepare. \nImproved Invisibility \n(IUusionPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is similar to the invisibility \nspell, but the recipient is able to attack, \neither by missile discharge, melee combat, \nor spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, \nhowever, that there are sometimes telltale \ntraces, a shimmering, so that an observant \nopponent can attack the invisible spell \nrecipient. These traces are only noticeable \nwhen specifically looked for (after the invis- \nible character has made his presence \nknown). Attacks against the invisible char- \nacter suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, \nand the invisible character's saving throws \nare made with a +4 bonus. High Hit Dice \ncreatures that might notice invisible oppo- \nnents will notice a creature under this spell \nas if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll sav- \ning throws vs. spell; success indicates they \nspot the character). \nLeomund's Secure Shelter \n(Alteration, Enchantment) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 + 1 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 turns \nArea of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to magically \ncall into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, \nmade of material that is common in the area \nwhere the spell is cast-stone, timber, or (at \nworst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is \n30 square feet per level of the spellcaster, \nand the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all \nrespects the lodging resembles a normal cot- \ntage, with a sturdy door, two or more shut- \ntered windows, and a small fireplace. \nWhile the lodging is secure against winds \nof up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating \nor cooling source (other than natural insula- \ntion qualities). Therefore it must be heated \nas a normal dwelling, and extreme heat \nadversely affects it and its occupants. The \ndwelling does, however, provide considera- \nble security otherwise, as it is as strong as a \n159 \nnormal stone building, regardless of its \nmaterial composition, resists flames and fire \nas if it were stone, and is impervious to nor- \nmal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege \nmachinery or giants). \nThe door, shutters, and even chimney are \nsecure against intrusion, the former two \nbeing wizard locked and the latter being \nsecured by a top grate of iron and a narrow \nflue. In addition, these three areas are pro- \ntected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen \nservant is caIled up to provide service to the \nspellcaster. \nThe inside of the shelter contains rude \nfurnishings as desired by the spellcaster-up \nto eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, \nas many as four chairs or eight stools, and a \nwriting desk. \nThe material components of this spell are \na square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few \ngrains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and \nseveral splinters of wood. These must be \naugmented by the components of the ah \nand unseen seruant spells if these benefits \nare to be included (string and silver wire and \na small bell). \nMagic Mirror (Enchmhnent, Divination) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 hour \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard changes \na normal mirror into a scrying device simi- \nlar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of \nsuch a scrying device are found in the DMG \nunder the description for the crystal ball. \nThe mirror used must be of finely \nwrought and highly polished silver of a min- \nimum cost not less than 1,OOO gp. This mir- \nror is not harmed by casting the spell, but \nthe other material components-the eye of a \nhawk, an eagle, ,or even a roc, and nitric \nacid, copper, and zinc-are used up. \nThe following spells can be cast through a \nmagic mirror: comprihzd languuges, miad \nmagic, tongues, and infrrmision. The fol- \nlowing spells have a 5 % chance per level of \nthe caster of operating correctly: detect \nmagic, detect good or evil, and message. \nThe base chances for the subject to detect \nany crystal ball-like spell is listed in the qs- \ntal ball entry in the DMG (see the \"Miscella- \nneous Magic\" section).\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 160 | PDF_PAGE 161]\nrn \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this soell is cast uvon willii crea- \ntures of maniize or smaller, up to I?) such \ncreatures per level of the caster can be magi- \ncally altered to appear as trees of any sort. \nThus a company of creatures can be made to \nappear as a copse, grove, or orchard. Fur- \nthermore, these massmorphed creatures can \nbe passed through-and even touched-by \nother creatures without revealii their true \nnature. Note, however, that blows to the \ncreature-trees cause damage, and blood can \nbe seen. \nCreatures to be massmorphed must be \nwithin the spell's area of effect and unwilling \ncreatures are not affected. Affected crea- \ntures remain unmoving but aware, subject \nto normal sleep requirements, and able to \nsee, hear, and feel for as long as the spell is in \neffect. The spell persists until the caster \ncommands it to cease or until a dispel magic \nspell is cast upon the creatures. Creatures \nleft in this state for extended periods are \nsubject to insects, weather, disease, fire, and \nother natural hazards. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nhandful of bark chips from the type of tree \nthe creatures are to become. \nMinor Creation (IllwiodPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to create an \nitem of non-living, vegetable nature-soft \ngoods, rope, wood, etc. The caster actually \npulls wisps of material of the plane of \nShadow from the air and weaves them into \nthe desired item. The volume of the item \ncreated cannot exceed one cubic foot per \nlevel of the spellcaster. The item remains in \nexistence for only as long as the spell's dura- \ntion. \nThe spellcaster must have at least a tiny \npiece of matter of the same type of item he \nplans to create by means of the minor crea- \ntion spell-a bit of twisted hemp to create \nrope, a splinter of wood to create a door, \nand so forth. \nI \nMinor Globe of Invulnerabiiity \n(Abjuration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates an immobile, faintly \nshimmering magical sphere around the \ncaster that prevents any 1st-, and-, or 3rd- \nlevel spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the \narea of effect of any such spells does not in- \nclude the area of the minor globe of hvul- \nnerability). This includes innate abilities \nand effects from devices. However, any \ntype of spell can be cast out of the magical \nsphere, and these pass from the caster of the \nglobe to their subject without affecting the \nminor globe. Fourth and higher level spells \nare not affected by the globe. The globe can \nbe brought down by a successful dispel \nmagic spell. The caster can leave and return \nto the globe without penalty. Note that spell \neffects are not actually disrupted by the \nglobe unless cast directly through or into \nit: The caster would still see a mirror image \ncreatedby a wizard outside the globe. If that \nwizard then entered the globe, the images \nwould wink out, to reappear when the wiz- \nard exited the globe. Likewise, a wizard \nstanding in the area of a light spell would \nstill receive sufficient light for vision, even \nthough that part of the light spell volume in \nthe globe would not be luminous. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nglass or crystal bead that shatters at the ex- \npiration of the spell. \nMonster Summoning II \n(ConjuratiowSummoning) \nRange: 40 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning 1 spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld6 2nd-level monsters. These ap- \npear anywhere within the spell range and at- \ntack the caster's opponents, until he \ncommands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale; they vanish \nwhen slain. If no opponent exists to fight \nand the wizard can communicate with \nthem, the summoned monsters can perform \nother services for the summoning wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \nOtiiuke's Resilient Sphere \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1-foot diameter/levd \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the result is a globe \nof shimmering force that encloses the sub- \nject creature-if it is small enough to fit \nwithin the diameter of the sphere and it fails \nto successfdy save vs. spell. The resilient \nsphere cnntains its subject for the spell's du- \nration, and it is not subject to damage of any \nsort except from a rod of cancellation, a \nwand of negation, or a disintegrate or dispel \nmagic spell. These cause it to be destroyed \nwithout harm to the subject. Nothing can \npass through the sphere, inside or out, \nthough the subject can breathe normally. \nThe subject may struggle, but all that occurs \nis a movement of the sphere. The globe can \nbe physically moved either by people out- \nside the globe or by the struggles of those \nwithin. \nThe material components of the spell are \na hemispherical piece of diamond (or similar \nhard, clear gem material) and a matching \nhemispherical piece of gum arabic. \nPhantasmal Killer (IllusionlPhsntrsm) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nthe illusion of the most fearsome thing \nimaginable to the victim, simply by fonnirlg \nthe fears of the victim's subconscious mind \ninto something that its conscious mind can \nvisualize-the most horriblebeast. Only the \nspell recipient can see the phantasmal killer \n(the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but \nif it succeeds in scoring a hit, thesubject dies \nfrom fright. The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice \nmonster. It is invulnerable to all attacks, \nand it can pass through any barriers. Once \ncast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it \nexists only in the subject's mind. \nThe only defenses against a phantasmal \nkiller are an attempt to disbelieve (which \ncan be tried but once), slaying or rendering \nunconscious the wizard who cast the spell, \nor rendering unconscious the target of the \nspell for its duration. To disbelieve the killer, \nthe subject must specifically state the at- \ntempt and then roll an Intelligence check. \nThis roll has a -1 penalty for every four \nlevels of the caster. \n160 \ni\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 161 | PDF_PAGE 162]\nSpedal modifiers apply to this attack: \nCondition Modifier \nsurprise -2 \nSubject previously attacked by \nthis spell + 1/ \nSubject is an illusionist +2 \nSubjm is wearing a helm of telepathy +3 \nMagic resistance, bonuses winst fear, \nand Wisdom adjustments also apply. Magic \nresistance is checked first to determine Spes1 \noperatioq, and then the fear/Wisdixn bonus \napplies ag a minus to the dice roll to match \nor score 1- than Intelligence. \nIf the su&ct of a phantasmal killer attack \nsucceeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a \nhelm of telepathy, the beast can be turned \nupon the wizard, who must then disbelieve \nit or be subject to its attack and possible \neffects. \nIf the subject ignores the killer to perform \nother actions, such as attacking the caster, \nthe kiIler may, at the DMs option, gain \nbonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, \netc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak \nof brmery, cast after the killer has attacked, \nant another check to disbelieve the effect. \nI Duration: Casting Time: Permanent 4 \nArea of Effect: An area 10’ per side/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a plant growth spell is cast, the wiz- \nard causes normal vegetation to grow, \nentwine, and entangle to form a thicket or \njungle that creatures must hack or force a \nway through at a movement rate of 1 per \nround (or 2 if larger than man-sized). The \narea must contain brush and trees for this \nspell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers, \nlianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, \nvines, and weeds become thick and over- \ngrown so as to form a barrier. The area of \neffect is 10 feet on a side per level of experi- \nence of the caster, in any square or rectangu- \nlar shape that the caster desires. Thus an \n8th-level wizard can affect an 80’ X 80’ \nsquare, a 160’ x 40’ rectangle, a 640’ x 10’ \nrectangle, etc. Individual plant girth and \nhe& is generally affected less than thick- \nness of brush, branch, and undergrowth. \nThe spell’s effects persist in the area until it is \ncleared by labor, fire, or such magical \nmeans as a dispel magic spell. \nPlant Growth (Alteration \nRange 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \n. \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \n~~~~ \nPolymorph Other (Alteration) \nRange: 5 yards/lwel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nmagic that completely alters the form and \nability, and possibly the personality and \nmentality, of the recipient. of course, while \na creature with a lower Intelligence can be \npolymorphed in form into something with a \nhigher Intelligence, it will not gain that crea- \nture’s mental ability. The reverse-poly- \nmorphing a higher Intelligence creature into \none of significantly lower Intelligence- \nresults in a creature much more intelligent \nthan appearances would lead one to believe. \nThe polymorphed creature must succeed on \na system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it \nsurvives the change. After this, it must \nmake a special Intelligence check to see if it \nretains its personality (see following). \nThe polymorphed creature acquires the \nfm4 apd physical abilities of the creature it \nbe& polymorphed into, while retaining \nnd. Form indudeo-natural Annor \ndue to skin toughness, but not \ndue t~ quickness, magical nature, etc.), \nphysic81 movement abilities (walking, \nswimming, fiishr with +, but not plane \nshifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and \nattack routines (daw/claw/bite, swoop, \nrake, constriction, but not petrifitation, \nbreath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit \npoints and saving throws do not change \nfrom the original form. Noncorporeal forms \ncannot be assumed.

As \nclass and level are not attributes of form, \nabilities derived from either cannot be \ngained by this spell, nor can exact ability \nscores be specified. \nWhen the polymorph occurs, the crea- \nture‘s equipment, if any, melds into the new \nform (in particularly challenging cam- \npaigns, the DM may allow protective \ndevices, such as a ring of protection, to con- \ntinue operating effectively). The creature \nretains its mental abilities, including spell \nuse, assuming the new form allows comple- \ntion of the proper verbal and somatic com- \nponents and the material components are \navailable.

Once this \nfinal change takes place, the creature \nacquires the new form‘s full range of magi- \ncal and special abilities. \nExample: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Ink&- \ngence is polymorph4 into a white dragon \nwith 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 8596 (20- \n8 Intelligence + 5 level d&kence 16-11 = 17 \nout of 20 = 85%) likely to actud€y become \none in allrespects, but in any case it has the \ndragon‘s physical and mental capabilities.

Those who have lost their indi- \nviduality and are then converted back main- \ntain the belief that they are actually the \npolymorphed creature and attempt to \nreturn to that form. Thus the orc who co~8 \nto believe he is a white dragon, when con- \nverted back to his orc form, ste-y \nmaintains he is really a white dragon poly- \nmorphed into the shape of an orc. His am- \npanions will most likely consider him mad. \nThe material component of this spell b a \ncaterpillar cocoon. \nPolymorph Self (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: 2 tumdlevel \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard IS auR \nto assume the hrm of any creature, save \nthose that are noncorporeal, from as small \nas a wren to as large as a hippopotamus. \nFurthermore, the wizard gains its physical \nmode of locomotion and breathing as well. \nNo system shock roll is required.

The caster retains all mental \nabilities, including spell use, assuming the \nnew form allows completion of the proper \nverbal and somatic components and the \nmaterial components are available. A caster \nnot used to a new form might be penalized \nat the DMs option (e.g., -2 penalty to \nattack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to \nmaster it. \nThus a wizard changed into an owl could \nfly, but his vision would be human; a \nchange to a black puddw wodd enable \nmovement under doors or along halls and \nceilings, but not the pudding’s offensive \n(acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, \nthe strength of the new form is sufficient to \nenable normal movement. The spellcaster \ncan change his form as often as desired for \nthe duration of the spell, each change \nrequiring a round. The wizard retains his \nown hit points, attack rolls, and saving \nthrows. The wizard can end the spell at any \ntime; when voluntarily returning to his own \nform and ending the spell, he regains Id12 \nhit points. The wizard also will return to his \nown fonn when slain or when the effect is \ndispelled, but no hit points are restored in \nthese cases. \nRillnbow Pattern \n(Alteration, Illusion/Phaatasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizari. Zreates \na glowing, rainbow-hued band of inter- \nweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it \nmay become fascinated and gaze at it as \nlong as the effect lasts. The spell can capti- \nvate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of \ncreatures-24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, \n12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affect- \ned must be within the area of effect, and \neach is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. \nAn attack on an affected creature that \ncauses damage frees it from the spell imme- \ndiately. Creatures that are restrained and \nremoved from the area still try to follow the \npattern. \nOnce the rainbow pattern is cast, the wiz- \nard need only gesture in the direction he \ndesires, and the pattern of colors moves \nslowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 \nfeet per round. It persists without further \nattention from the spellcaster for ld3 \nrounds. All affected creatures follow the \nmoving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads \nits subjects into a dangerous area (through \nflame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second sav- \ning throw. If the view of the lights is com- \npletely blocked (by an obscurement spell, \nfor instance), the spell is negated. \nThe wizard need not utter a sound, but he \nmust gesture appropriately while holding a \ncrystal prism and the material component, a \npiece of phosphor. \nRq’s Mnemonic Enhancer \n(Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto memorize, or retain the memory of, three \nadditional spell levels (three 1st-level spells, \nor one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level \nspell). The wizard has two options: \nA) Memorize additional spells. This \noption is taken at the time the spell is cast. \nThe additional spells must be memorized \nnormally and any material components \nmust be acquired. \nB) Retain memory of any spell (within the \nlevel limits) cast the round prior to starting \nto cast this spell. The round after a spell is \ncast, the enhancer must be successfully cast. \nThis restores the previously cast spell to \nmemory. Any material components must be \nacquired by the caster, however. \nThe material components of the spell are \na piece of string, an ivory plaque of at least \n100 gp value, and ink consisting of squid \nsecretion with either black dragon’s blood \nor giant slug digestive juice. These disap \npear when the spell is cast. \nRemove Curse (Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard is usu- \nally able to remove a curse-whether it is on \nan object, or a person, or in the form of \nsome undesired sending or evil presence. \nNote that the remove curse spell cannot \naffect a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of \narmor, for example, although it usually \nenables a person afflitted with a cursed item \nto be rid of it. Certain special curses may not \nbe countered by this spell, or may be coun- \ntered only by a caster of a certain level or \n162 \nmore. A caster of 12th level or more can \ncure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it \non the animal form. The were-creature \nreceives a saving throw vs. spell and, if suc- \ncessful, the spell fails and the wizard must \ngain a level before attempting the remedy \nagain. \nThe reverse of the spell is not permanent; \nthe bestow cum lasts for one turn for every \nexperience level of the wizard casting the \nspell. It causes one of the following effects \n(roll percentile dice): \nDlOO \nRoll Result \n1-50 Lowers one ability of the subject to \n3 (the DM determines which by \nrandom selection) \n51-75 Worsens the subject’s attack rolls \nand saving throws by -4 \n76-00 Makes the subject 50% likely per \nturn to drop whatever it is holding \n(or simply do nothing, in the case \nof creatures not using tools) \nIt is possible for a wizard to devise his \nown curse, and it should be similar in power \nto those given (the DM has final say). The \nsubject of a bestow curse spell must be \ntouched. If the subject is touched, a saving \nthrow is still applicable; if it is successful, \nthe effect is negated. The bestowed curse \ncannot be dispelled. \nShadow Monsters (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nA wizard casting the shadow monsters \nspell uses material from the plane of \nShadow to shape semi-real illusions of one \nor more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the \nshadow monster or monsters thus created \ncannot exceed the level of experience of the \nwizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create \none creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that \nhave 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters \ncreated by one spell must be of the same \nsort. The actual hit point total for each \nmonster is 20% of the hit point total it \nwould normally have. (To determine ’this, \nroll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply \nthe hit points by .2. Any remainder less than \n.4 is dropped-in the case of monsters with \n1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the mon- \nster was not successfully created-and \nscores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 \nhit point.) \nThose viewing the shadow monsters are \nallowed to disbelieve as per normal illu- \nsions, although there is a -2 penalty to the \nattempt. The shadow monsters perform as \nthe real monsters with respect to Armor \ni \ni\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 163 | PDF_PAGE 164]\n- \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nr \nClass and attack forms. Those who believe \nin the shadow monsters suffer real damage \nfrom their attacks. Special attack forms \nsuch as petrification or level drain do not \nactually occur, but a subject who believes \nthey are real will react appropriately. \nThose who roll successful saving throws \nsee the shadow monsters as transparent \nimages superimposed on vague shadowy \nforms. These are Annor Class 10 and inflict \nonly 20% of normal melee damage (biting, \nclawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional \ndamage less than .4 as done with hit points. \nExample: A shadow monster griffon \nattacks a person who knows it is only quasi- \nreal. The monster strikes with two claw \nattacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die \nmonster. All three attacks hit, and the nor- \nmal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2 \nseparately, rounded up or down, then added \ntogether to get total damage. Thus if the \nattacks score 4,2, and 11 points, then a total \nof 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = \n.8 [rounded to 1],2 X .2 .4 [rounded to \n11.11 x .2 = 2.2 [rounded to 21. The sum is \n1 + 1 + 2 = 4). \nShout (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V,M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot X =foot cone \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a shout spell is cast, the wizard \ngives himself tremendous vocal powers. \nThe caster can emit an ear-splitting noise \nthat has a principal effect in a cone shape \nradiating from his mouth to a point 30 feet \naway. Any creature within this area is deaf- \nened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d6 points \nof damage. A successful saving throw vs. \nspell negates the deafness and reduces the \ndamage by half. Any exposed brittle or \ncrystal substance subject to sonic vibrations \nis shattered by a shout, while those brittle \nobjects in the possession of a creature \nreceive the creature’s saving throw. Deaf- \nened creatures suffer a -1 penalty to sur- \nprise rolls, and those that cast spells with \nverbal components are 20% likely to mis- \ncast them. \nThe shout spell cannot‘penetrate the 2nd- \nlevel clerical spell, silence, 10’ radius. This \nspell can be employed but once per day, for \notherwise the caster might permanently \ndeafen himself. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of honey, a drop of citric acid, and a \nsmall cone made from a bull or ram horn. \nL \nSolid Fog (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 rounaiievei \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 20’ x 10’ x 10‘ volume/ \nlevel of caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \na billowing mass of misty vapors similar to \na wall of fog spell. The caster can create less \nvapor if desired, as long as a rectangular or \ncubic mass at least 10 feet dn a side is \nformed. The fog obscures all sight, normal \nand infravision, beyond two feet. However, \nunlike normal fog, only a very strong wind \ncan move these vapors, and any creature \nattempting to move through the solid fog \nprogresses at a rate of but one foot per \nmovement rate of 1 per round. A gust of \nwind spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame \nstrike, or a wall of fire can bum it away in a \nsingle round. \nThe material components for the spell are \na pinch of dried, powdered peas combined \nwith powdered animal hoof. \nStoneskin (Alt \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCastinn Time: 1 \nArea 07 Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the affected crea- \nture gains a virtual immunity to any attack \nby cut, blow, projectile, or the like. Even a \nsword of sharpness cannot affect a creature \nprotected by stoneskin, nor can a rock \nhurled by a giant, a snake’s strike, etc. How- \never, magical attacks from such spells as \nfireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and \nso forth have their normal effects. The spell \nblocks ld4 attacks, plus one attack per two \nlevels of experience the caster has achieved. \nThis limit applies regardless of attack rolls \nand regardless of whether the attack was \nphysical or magical. For example, a \nstoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard \nwould protect against from five to eight \nattacks. An attacking griffon would reduce \nthe protection by three each round; four \nmagic missiles would count as four attacks \nin addition to inflicting their normal dam- \nage. \nThe material components of the spell are \ngranite and diamond dust sprinkled on the \nrecipient’s skin. \n163 \nVacancy (Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radi \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a vacancy spell is cast, th \ncauses an area to appear to be \nneglected, and unused. Those wh \nthe area see dust on the floor, cobwe \nand other conditions typical of a \nabandoned place. If they pass through the \narea of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear \naway cobwebs, and so on. Unless they actu- \nally contact some object cloaked by the \nspell, the place appears empty. Merely \nbrushing an invisible object does not cause \nthe vacancy spell to be disturbed: Only \nforceful contact grants a chance to note that \nall is not as it seems. \nIf forceful contact with a cloaked obj& \noccurs, those creatures subject to the spell \ncan penetrate the spell only if they discover \nseveral items that they cannot see; each \nbeing is then entitled to a saving throw vs. \nspell. Failure means they believe that the \nobjects are invisible. A dispel magic spell \ncancels this spell so that the true area is seen. \netrate the deception, \nest black silk to cast this spell. This material \ncomponent must be worth at least 100 \nand is used up during spellc \nWall of Fire (Evocation) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe wall of fire spell brings forth an \nimmobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of \n.shimmering color-violet or reddish-blue. \nThe spell creates either an opaque sheet of \nflame up to one 20-foot square per level of \nthe spellcaster, or a ring with a radius af up \nto 10 feet + five feet per two levels of expe- \nrience of the wizard. In either form, the wall \nof fire is 20 feet high. \nThe wall of fire must be cast so that it is \nvertical with respect to the caster. One side \nof the wall, selected by the caster, sends \nforth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of \ndamage upon creatures within 10 feet and \nld4 points of damage upon those within u)\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 164 | PDF_PAGE 165]\nWizard Spells (5th Level, \nfeet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points \nof damage, plus 1 point of damage per level \nof the spellcaster, upon any creature passing \nthrough it. Creatures especially subject to \nfire may take additional damage, and \nundead always take twice normal damage. \nNote that attempting to catch a moving \ncreature with a newly-created wall of fire is \ndifficult; a successful saving throw enables \nthe creature to avoid the wall, while its rate \nand direction of movement determine \nwhich side of the created wall it is on. The \nwall of fire lasts as long as the wizard con- \ncentrates on maintaining it, or one round \nper level of experience of the wizard, in the \nevent he does not wish to concentrate upon \nit. \nThe material component of the spell is \nphosphorus. \nWall of Ice (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast in one of three \nways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a \nhemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall \nupon creatures with the effect of an ice \nstorm. \nA) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a \nsheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall \nis primarily defensive, stopping pursuers \nand the like. The wall is one inch thick per \nlevel of experience of the wizard. It covers a \n10-foot-square area per level (a loth-level \nwizard can create a wall of ice up to 100 feet \nlong and 10 feet high or 50 feet long and 20 \nfeet high, etc.). Any creature breaking \nthrough the ice suffers 2 points of damage \nper inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using \ncreatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, \nwhile cold-using creatures suffer only 1 \npoint of damage per inch when breaking \nthrough. The plane can be oriented in any \nfashion as long as it is anchored aIong one or \nmore sides. \nB) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell \ncreates a hemisphere whose maximum radi- \nus is equal to three feet plus one foot per \ncaster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can cre- \nate a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemi- \nsphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or \nmelted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, \nto trap mobile opponents under the hemi- \nsphere. \nC) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell \ncauses a horizontal sheet to fall upon oppo- \nnents. The sheet covers a Wfoot-square \narea per caster level. The sheet has the same \neffect as an jce storm's hail stones--3dlO \n% \nA wall of ice cannot form in an ivea occu- \npied by physical objects or creatures; its sur- \nface must be smooth and unbroken when \ncreated. Magical fires such as fireballs and \nfiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one \nround, though this creates a great cloud of \nsteamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires \nor lesser magical ones do not hasten the \nmelting of a wall of ice. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall piece of quartz or similar rock crystal. \nWizard Eye (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is employed, the wizard \ncreates an invisible sensory organ that sends \nhim visual information. The wizard eye \ntravels at 30 feet per round if viewing an \narea ahead as a human would (i.e., primari- \nly looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round \nif examining the ceiling and walls as well as \nthe floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with \ninfravision up to 10 feet, and with normal \nvision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit \nareas. The wizard eye can travel in any \ndirection as as long as the spell lasts. It has \nsubstance and a form that can be detected \n(by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). \nSolid barriers prevent the passage of a wiz- \nard eye, although it can pass through a \n!pace no smaller than a small mouse hole \n[one inch in diameter). \nUsing the eye requires the wizard to con- \n:entrate. However, if his concentration is \nwoken the spell does not end-the eye \nnerely becomes inert until the wizard again \n:oncentrates, subject to the duration of the \nipell. The powers of the eye cannot be \n?nhanced by other spells or items. The cast- \n!r is subject to any gaze attack met by the \n:ye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard \nor eye ends the spell. With respect to blind- \nness, magical darkness, and so on, the wiz- \nard eye is considered an independent sen- \nsory organ of the caster. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of bat fur. \nof damage inflicted to creatures \nc \nFitth-Level Spells \nAdvanced Illusion (Musion/Ph.ntarm) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: One afoot cube + \na IO-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is essentially a spectral forces \nspell that operates through a program (simi- \nlar to a programmed illusion spell) deter- \nmined by the caster. It is thus unnecessary \nfor the wiwd to concentrate on the spell for \nlonger than the round of casting it, as the \nprogram has then started and will continue \nwithout supervision. The illusion has vis- \nual, audio, olfactory, and thermal compo- \nnents. If any viewer actively attempts to \ndisbelieve the spell, he gains a saving throw\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 165 | PDF_PAGE 166]\nWizard Spells (5th level) \nvs. spell. If any viewer successfully disbe- \nlieves and communicates this fact to other \nviewers, each such viewer gains a saving \nthrow vs. spell with a +4 bonus. \nThe material components are a bit of \nfleece and several grains of sand. \nAi- Water (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 10‘ radius sphere or \nSaving Throw: None \nThe airy water spell turns normal liquid, \nsuch as water or water-based solutions, into \na less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if \nthe wizard wanted to enter an underwater \nplace, he would step into the water, cast the \nspell and sink downward in a globe of bub- \nbling water. He and any companions in the \nspells area of effect can move freely and \nbreathe just as if the bubbling water were \nair. The globe is centered on and moves with \nthe caster. Water-breathing creatures avoid \na sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, al- \nthough intelligent ones can enter it if they \nare able to move by means other than swim- \nming. No water-breathers can breathe in an \narea affected by this spell. There is only one \nword that needs to be spoken to actuate the \nmagic, thus it can be cast underwater. The \nspell does not filter or remove solid particles \nof matter. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall handful of alkaline or bromine salts. \n15’ radius hemisphere \nAnimal Growth (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nArea of Effect: UP to 8 animals in \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard causes \nall designated animals, up to a maximum of \neight, within a 2Gfoot-square area to grow \nto twice their normal size. The effects of this \ngrowth are doubled Hit Dice (with improve- \nment in attack rolls) and doubled damage in \ncombat. The spell lasts for one round for \neach level of experience of the wizard cast- \ning the spell. Only natural animals, includ- \ning giant forms, can be affected by this spell. \nThe reverse, shrink animal, reduces ani- \nmal size by half and likewise reduces Hit \nDice, attack damage, etc. \nThe component of both versions of the \nspell is a pinch of powdered bone. \nAnimate Dead (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates the lowest of the undead \nmonsters-skeletons or zombies-usually \nfrom the bones or bodies of dead humans, \ndemihumans, or humanoids. The spell \ncauses existing remains to become animated \nand obey the simple verbal commands of \nthe caster. The skeletons or zombies can fol- \nlow the caster, remain in an area and attack \nany creature (or just a specific type of crea- \nture) entering the place, etc. The undead re- \nmain animated until they are destroyed in \ncombat or are turned; the magic cannot be \ndispelled. The following types of dead crea- \ntures can be animated: \nA) Humans, demihumans, and human- \noids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate \none skeleton for each experience level he has \nattained, or one zombie for every two \nlevels. The experience levels, if any, of the \nslain are ignored: the body of a newly dead \n9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie \nwith 2 Hit Dice, without special class or ra- \ncial abilities. \nB) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. \nThe number of undead animated is deter- \nmined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit \nDice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skel- \netal forms have the Hit Dice of the original \ncreature, while zombie forms have one \nmore Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard \ncould animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + \n1 Hit Dice] = 121, or a single fire giant skele- \nton. Such undead have none of the special \nabilities they had in life. \nC) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The \ncaster can animate two skeletons per level \nor one zombie per level. The creatures have \ntheir normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an \nadditional Hit Die as zombies, Clerics re- \nceive a + 1 bonus when trying to turn these. \nThis spell assumes that the bodies or \nbones are available and are reasonably in- \ntact (those of skeletons or zombies de- \nstroyed in combat won’t bel). \nIt requires a drop of blood and a pinch of \nbone powder or a bone shard to complete \nthe spell. The casting of this spell is not a \ngood act and only evil wizards use it fre- \nquently. \n1 \nAvoidance (Abjuration, Alte - \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, s, M \nDuration: Permanent until dispel \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Up to 3-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \ntive mass of the two (a halfling attempting \nto touch an iron chest with an avoidance \ncreature as the creature approaches). \nThe material component for the spell is a \nmagnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast \nupon living things; any attempt to cast \navoidance upon the apparel or possessions \nof a living creature entitles the subject ma- \nture to a saving throw vs. spell. \nThe reverse of this spell, attraction, uses \nthe same material components and sets up a \nnatural attraction between the affected ob- \nject and aIl living things. A creature is \ndrawn to the object if the mature is smaller; \nor the object slides toward the creature if the \ncreature is larger. A successful bend bars roll \nmust be rolled to remove the enchanted ob- \nject once it has adhered to an object or ma- \nture. \nBigby’s Interposing Hand \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \ngargantuan-sized magical hand that appears \nbetween the spellcaster and his chosen op \nponent.

Those allowed sav- \ning throws roll them vs. spell with -2 pen- \nalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who \nsuccessfully save are unaffected by the spell. \nAffected creatures react as follows: \nDIORoll Action \n1 Wander away (unless prevented) \nfor duration of spell \n2-6 Stand confused one round \n(then roll again) \n1-3 Attack nearest creature for one \nround (then roll again) \n10 Act normally for one round \n(then roll again) \nThe spell lasts one round for each level of \nthe caster. Those affected are checked by the \nDM for actions each round for the duration \nof the spell, or until the \"wander away for \nthe duration of the spell\" result occurs. \nWandering creatures move as far from the \ncaster as possible using their most typical \nmode of movement (characters walk, fish \nswim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and \nactions are checked at the beginning of each \nround. Any confused creature that is \nattacked perceives the attacker as an enemy \nand acts according to its basic nature. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall disc of bronze and a small rod of iron. \nCloudkill (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 40' wide, 20' high, \n20' deep cloud \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell generates a billowing cloud of \nghastly yellowish green vapors that is so \ntoxic as to slay any creature with fewer than \n4 + 1 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4 + 1 to \n5 + 1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poi- \nson with - 4 penalties or be slain, and crea- \ntures up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll \nunmodified saving throws vs. poison or be \nslain. Holding one's breath has no effect on \nthe lethality of the spell. Those above 6th \nlevel (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud \nimmediately or suffer Id10 points of poison \ndamage each round while in the area of \neffect. \nThe cloudkill moves away from the spell- \ncaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the \nsurface of the ground. A moderate breeze \ncauses it to alter course (roll for direction), \nbut it does not move back toward its caster. \nA strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, \nand a greater wind force prevents the use of \nthe spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse \nthe cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are \nheavier than air, they sink to the lowest \nlevel of the land, even pour down den or \nsinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for \nslaying nests of giant ants, for example. It \ncannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast \nunderwater. \nCone of Cold (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nWhen this spell is cast, it causes a cone- \nshaped area of extreme cold, originating at \nthe wizards hand and extending outward in \na cone five feet long and one foot in diame- \nter per level of the caster. It drains heat and \ncauses ld4 + 1 points of damage per level of \nexperience of the wizard. For example, a \n10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold \n10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing \n1Od4 + 10 points of damage. \nIts material component is a crystal or \nglass cone of very small size. \nConjure Elemental \n(Conjuration/Surnmoning) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThere are actually four spells in the con- \njure elemental spell. The wizard is able to \nconjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemen- \ntal with this spell-assuming he has the \nmaterial component for the particular ele- \nmental. (A considerable fire source must be \nin range to conjure a fire elemental; a large \namount of water must be available to con- \njure a water elemental.) Conjured elemen- \ntals have 8 Hit Dice. \nIt is possible to conjure up successive ele- \nmentals of different types if the spellcaster \nhas memorized two or more of these spells. \nThe type of elemental to be conjured must \nbe decided upon before memorizing the \nspell. Each type of elemental can be con- \njured only once per day. \nTheelemental conjured up must be con- \ntrolled by the wizard-the spellcaster must \nconcentrate on the elemental doing his \ncommands-or it turns on the wizard and \nattacks. The elemental will not break off a \ncombat to do so, but it will avoid creatures \nwhile seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is \nwounded or grappled, his concentration is \nbroken. There is always a 5% chance that \nthe elemental turns on its conjurer regard- \nless of concentration. This check is made at \nthe end of the second and each succeeding \nround. An elemental that breaks free of its \ncontrol can be dispelled by the caster, but \nthe chance of success is only 50%. The de- \nmental can be controlled up to 30 yards \naway per level of the spellcaster. The ele- \nmental remains until its form on this plane is \ndestroyed due to damage or until the spell's \nduration expires. Note that water elemen- \ntals are destroyed if they are ever morc thur \n50 yards from a large body of water. \nThe material component of the spell \n:besides the quantity of the element at hand) \nIS a small amount of one of the following: \n4ir Elemental-burning incense \nEarth Elemental-soft clay \nFire Elemental-sdphur and phosphorus \nWater Elemental-water and sand \nSpecial protection from uncontrolled ele- \nmentals is available by means of a protec- \ntion from mil spell. \n166\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 167 | PDF_PAGE 168]\ncontact Other t'iane (Divination) \n&ge: o \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard sends \nhis mind to another plane of existence in \norder to receive advice and information \nfrom powers there. As these powers resent \nsuch contact, only brief answers are given. \n(The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \n\"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) \nAny questions asked are answered by the \npower during the spell's duration. The char- \nacter can contact an elemental plane or \nsome plane farther removed. For every two \nlevels of experience of the wizard, one ques- \ntion may be asked. Contact with minds far \nremoved from the plane of the wizard \nincreases the probability of the spellcaster \ngoing insane or dying, but the chance of the \npower knowing the answer, as well as the \nprobability of the being telling the correct \nanswer, are likewise increased by moving to \ndistant planes. Once the outer planes are \nreached, the Intelligence of the power con- \ntacted determines the effects. \nThe random table given here is subject to \nDM changes, development of extraplanar \nNPC beine, and so on. \nIf insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the \nfirst question is asked. This condition lasts \nfor one week for each removal of the plane \ncontacted (see the DMG or Manual of the \nPlanes), to a maximum of ten weeks. There \nis a 1 % chance per plane that the wizard dies \nbefore recovering, unless a remove curse \nspell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard \ncan recall the answer to the question. \nOn rare occasions, this divination may be \nblocked by the action of certain lesser or \ngreater powers. \ncific outer plane to be contacted (s \nManual of ;he Planes); in this case, \ndifference in alignment between the c \ner and the plane contacted alters \nmaximum Intelligence that can \ncontacted-each difference in moral \nethical alignment lowers the maxim \nIntelligence that can be contacted by \n(e.g., an 18th-level lawful good cast \ncould contact the plane of the Seven \nHeavens (LG) on the \"Intelligence 20\" \nline, or the plane of Elysium (NG) on the \n\"Intelligence 19\" linl \nDemi-Shadow Monsters \n(IllusiodPhantasrn) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to the 4th-level spell, \nshadow monsters, except that the monsters \ncreated are effectively 40% of normal hit \npoints.

Mag- \nic resistance, if any, is checked if this spell is \nused to force a being home. If the resistance \nfails, the caster's level is compared to the \ncreature's level or Hit Dice. If the wizard's \nlevel is higher, the difference is subtracted \nfrom the creature's die roll for its saving \nthrow vs. spell. If the creature's level w Hit \nDice is higher, the difference is added to the \nsaving throw roll. \nIf the creature desires to be returned to its \nhome plane, no saving throw is necessary (it \nchooses to fail the roll). \nIf the spell is successful, the creature is \ninstantly whisked away, but the spell has a \n20% chance of actually sending the subject \nto a plane other than its own. \nThe material component is any item that \nis distasteful to the subject creature. \nDistance Distortion (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration! 2 turns/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube per lrvd \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast only in an area \npletely surrounded or enclosed by ea&, \nrock, sand, or similar materials. The wizard \nmust also cast a conjure elemental spell to \nsummon an earth elemental. The elemental \nserves without attempting to break free \nwhen the spellcaster announces that his \nintent is to cast a distance distortion spell. \nThe spell places the earth elemental in the \narea of effect, and the elemental then causes \nthe area's dimensions to be either doubled or \nhalved for those traveling over it (spellcud- \ner's choice of which). Thus a 10' x 100' cor- \nridor could seem to be either five feet wide \nand 50 ket long or 20 feet wide and 200 fegt \nlong. When the spell duration has elapsed, \nthe elemental returns to its own plane. \nThe true nature of an area affected by die \ntance distortion is undetectable to any crea- \nture traveling along it, but the area dimly \nradiates magic, and-a true seeing spell can \nreveal that an earth elemental is spread \nwithin the area. \nThe material needed for this spell is a \nsmall lump of soft clay.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 168 | PDF_PAGE 169]\nDomination (EhchantmenVCharm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 person \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe domination spell enables the caster to \ncontrol the actions of any person until the \nspell is ended by the subject's Intelligence \n(see the charm person spell). Elves and half- \nelves resist this enchantment as they do all \ncharm-type spells. When the spell is cast, \nthe subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell \nat a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjust- \nments apply. Failure means the wizard has \nestablished a telepathic link with the sub- \nject's mind. If a common language is shared, \nthe wizard can generally force the subject to \nperform as the wizard desires, within the \nlimits of the subject's body structure and \nStrength. Note that the caster does not re- \nceive direct sensory input from the subject. \nSubjects resist this control, and those \nforced to take actions against their natures \nreceive a new saving throw with a bonus of \n+ 1 to + 4, depending on the type of action \nrequired. Obviously selfdestructive orders \nare not carried out. Once control is estab- \nlished, there is no limit to the range at which \nit can be exercised, as long as the caster and \nsubject are on the same plane. \nA protection from evil spell can prevent \nthe caster from exercising control or using \nthe telepathic link while the subject is so \nwarded, but it cannot prevent the establish- \nment of domination. \nDream (Invocation, IllusiodPhantasm) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration Spefial \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creatu \nSaving Throw: None \nThe dream spell enables the caster, or a \nmessenger touched by the caster, to send \nmessages to others in the form of dreams. At \nthe beginning of the spell, the caster must \nname the recipient or identify him by some \ntitle that leaves no doubt as to his identity. \nAs the caster completes the spell, the per- \nson sending the spell falls into a deep trance- \nlike sleep, and instantaneously projects his \nmind to the recipient. The sender then en- \nters the recipient's dream and delivers the \nmessage unless the recipient is magically \nprotected. If the recipient is awake, the mes- \nsage sender can choose to remain in the \ntrancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed \nduring this time, the spell is immediately \ncancelled and the sender comes out of the \ntrance. The whereabouts and current activi- \nties of the recipient cannot be learned \nthrough this spell. \nThe sender is unaware of his own sur- \nroundings or the activities around him while \nhe is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, \nboth physically and mentally (i.e., he al- \nways fails any saving throw) while in the \ntrance. \nOnce the recipient's dreams are entered, \nthe sender can deliver a message of any \nlength, which the recipient remembers per- \nfectly upon waking. The communication is \none-way, the recipient cannot ask questions \nor offer information. Nor can the sender \ngain any information by observing the \ndreams of the recipient. Once the message is \ndelivered, the sender's mind returns in- \nstantly to his body. The duration of the spell \nis the time required for the sender to enter \nthe recipient's dream and deliver the mes- \nsage. \nThe reverse of this spell, nightmare, en- \nables the caster to send a hideous and unset- \ntling vision to the recipient, who is allowed \na saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. \nThe nightmare prevents restful sleep and \ncauses Id10 hit points of damage. The \nnightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and \nunable to regain spells for the next day. A \ndispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns \nthe caster of the nightmare for one turn per \nlevel of the cleric countering this evil send- \ning. \nExtension II (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is the same as the 4th-level ex- \ntension I spell, except it extends the duration \nof 1st- through 4th-level spells by 50%. \nFabricate (Enchantment, Alteration) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic yd./level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto convert material of one sort into a \nproduct that is of the same material. Thus \nthe spellcaster can fabricate a wooden \nbridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a \npatch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool, \nand so forth. Magical or living thw can- \nnot be created or altered by a fabricate spell. \nThe quality of items made by this spell is \ncommensurate with the quality of material \nused as the basis for the new fabrication. If a \n168 \nmineral is worked with, the area of effect is \nreduced by a factor of 27-one cubic foot \nper level instead of one cubic yard. \nArticles requiring a high degree of crafts- \nmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, \netc.) cannot be fabricated unless the wizard \notherwise has great skill in the appropriate \ncraft. \nCasting requires one full round per cubic \nyard (or foot) or material to be affected by \nthe spell. \nFalse Vision (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: %foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto confound any attempt to scry (by means I \nof either a spell or a magical device) any I \npoint within the area of effect of the spell. To \nuse the spell, he must be aware of the scry- . \ning attempt, although knowledge of the 4 \nscryer or the sayer's location is not n- \nsary. Upon casting the spell, the caster and \nall he desires within the radius of the spell \nbecome undetectable to the suying. Fur- \nthermore, the caster is able to send what- \never message he desires, including vision \nand sound, according to the medium of the \nscrying method. To do this, the caster must \nconcentrate op the message he is sending. \nOnce concentration is broken, no further \nimages can be sent, although the caster re- \nmains undetectable for the duration of the \nSpell. \nThe material component for this spell is \nthe ground dust of an emerald worth at least \n500 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when \nthe spell is cast. \nFeeblemind (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is used solely against people or \ncreatures who use magic spells. Feeblemind \ncauses the subject's intellect to degrwate to \nthat of a moronic child. The subject remains \nin this state until a heal or wish spell is used \nto cancel the effects. Magic-using beings are \nvery vulnerable to this spell, thus their sav- \ning throwesuffer the following penalties: \nSaving Throw \nSpell Use of Target Adjustment \nPriest +1 \nWizard (human) -4 \nCombination or nonhuman -2\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 169 | PDF_PAGE 170]\nthrow. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nhandful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral \nspheres, which disappears when the spell is \ncast. \nHold Monster (EnchantmenVCharm) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a \n40-fOOt cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell immobilizes from one to four \ncreatures of any type within spell range and \nin sight of the spellcaster. He can opt to hold \none, two, three, or four creatures. If three or \nfour are attacked, each saving throw is nor- \nmal; if two are attacked, each saving throw \nsuffers a - 1 penalty; if only one is attacked, \nthe saving throw suffers a -3 penalty. \nThe material component for this spell is \none hard metal bar or rod for each monster \nto be held. The bar or rod can be as small as \na three-penny nail. \nLeomund’s Lamentable \nBelaborment (Enchantment, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 10- \nfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis devious spell distracts the subject \ncreatures by drawing them into an absorb- \ning discussion on topics of interest to them. \nA chain of responses occurs during the next \n11 rounds, with additional saving throws as \ndescribed later. These responses are conver- \nsation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion \n(rounds 44, then either rage or lamenta- \ntion (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are \naffected by the creatures’ Intelligences, as \nnoted later. The subject creatures must be \nable to understand the language in which \nthe spellcaster speaks. \nUpon casting the spell, the wizard begins \ndiscussion of some topic germane to the \ncreature or creatures to be affected. Those \nmaking a successful saving throw vs. spell \nare unaffected. Affected creatures immedi- \nately begin to converse with the spellcaster, \nagreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As \nlong as the spellcaster chooses, he can main- \ntain the spell by conversing with the sub- \nject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise \ndistracted, the subject creatures do not \nnotice. \nWizard Spells (5th Level) \nIntelligence Saving Throw Modifier \n2 or less \n3 to 7 -1 \n8 to 10 0’ \n11 to 14 +1 \nSpell has no effect \n15 or higher +2 \nThe wizard can leave at any time after the \ncasting and the subject($ continue on as if \nthe caster were still present. As long as they \nare not attacked, the creatures ignore all else \ngoing on around them, spending their time \ntalking and arguing to the exclusion of other \nactivities. However, when the caster leaves, \neach subject completes only the stage of the \nspell that it is currently in, and then the spell \nis broken. \nIf the caster maintains the spell for more \nthan three rounds, each affected creature \ncan roll another saving throw vs. spell. \nThose failing to save wander off in confu- \nsion for Id10 + 2 rounds, staying away \nfrom the spellcaster. Those who make this \nsaving throw continue to talk and roll sav- \ning throws each round the caster continues \nthe spell, up through the sixth round, to \navoid the confusion effect. \nIf the spell is maintained for more than six \nrounds, each subject must roll a successful \nsaving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a \nrage, attacking all other subjects of the spell \nwith intent to kill. This rage lasts for ld4 + 1 \nrounds. Those who successfully save \nagainst the rage effect realize that they have \nbeen deceived and collapse to the ground, \nlamenting their foolishness, for ld4 rounds \nunless attacked or otherwise disturbed. \nLeomund’s Secret Chest \n(Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 60 days \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 chest of about \n2‘ x 2’ x 3’size \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables a specially constructed \nchest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal \nplane, to be summoned using a small model \nof the chest. The large chest must be excep- \ntionally well-crafted and expensive, con- \nstructed for the caster by master craftsmen. \nIf made principally of wood, it must be ebo- \nny, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the \nlike, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and \nhardware must be platinum. If constructed \nof ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must \nbe gold. If the chest is fashioned from \nbronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be \nelectrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is \nnever less than 5,000 gp. Once it is con- \nstructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica \n(of the same materials and perfect in every \ndetail) made, so that the miniature of the \nchest appears to be a perfect copy. One wiz- \nard can have but one pair of these chests at \nany given time-even wish spells do not \nallow exceptions! The chests themselves are \nnonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, \nwards, and so on just as any normal chest. \nWhile touching the chest and holding \ncauses the large chest to vanish into the \nEthereal plane. The chest can contain one \ncubic foot of material per level of the wizard \nno matter what its apparent size. Living \nmatter makes it 75% likely that the spell \nfails, so the chest is typically used for sear- \ning valuable spell books, magical items, \ngems, etc. As long as the spelkast \nsmall duplicate of the magical che \ntiny replica, the caster chants the spell. Tp \nrecall the large one from the Ethereal plane \nwhenever the chest is desired. If the minia- \nture of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is \nno way, not even a iish spell, that the large \nchest can return, although an ex \nmight be mounted to find it. \nthere is a 1% cumulative chance \nthat some being finds it. This chance is reset \nto 1 % whenever the chest is recalled and the \nspell recast to return it to the Ethereal plane. \nIf the chest is found, the DM must work out \nthe encounter and decide how the being \nreacts to the chest (for example, it might \nignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, \nor even exchange or add to the items \npresent!). \nWhenever the secret chest is brought back \nto the Prime Material plane, an ethereal \nwindow is opened and for a variable \namount of time, usually about one turn, \nslowly diminishes in size. When this hole \nopens between the planes, check for an ethe- \nreal encounter to see if a monster is drawn \nthrough. \nIf the large chest is not retrieved before \nthe spell duration lapses, there is a cumula- \nlost. \nMagic Jar (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Swcial \nWhile the chest is in the Ethereal \ntive chance of 5% per day t S \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe magic jar spell enables the \nshift his life force into a special rec - \ngem or large crystal). From there the caster \ncan force an exchange of life forces between \nthe receptacle and another creature, thus \nenabling the wizard to take over and control \nthe body of another creature, while the life \nforce of the host is confined in the recepta- \ncle. The special life force receptacle must be \nwithin spell range of the wizards body at \nthe time of spellcasting. The wizards life \nforce shifts into the receptacle in the round \n1 69\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 170 | PDF_PAGE 171]\nWizard Spells (5th Level) \nin which the casting is completed, allowing \nno other actions. \nWhile in the magic jar, the caster can \nsense and attack any life force within a 10- \nfoot-per-level radius (on the same plane); \nhowever, the exact creature types and rela- \ntive physical positions cannot be deter- \nmined. In a group of life forces, the caster \ncan sense a difference of four or more \nlevels/Hit Dice and can determine whether \na life force is positive or negative energy. For \nexample, if two 10th-level fighters are \nattacking a hill giant and four ogres, the \ncaster could determine that there are three \nstronger and four weaker life forces within \nrange, all with positive life energy. The cast- \ner could try to take over either a stronger or \na weaker creature, but he has no control \nover exactly which creature is attacked. \nAn attempt to take’over a host body \nrequires a full round. It is blocked by a pro- \ntection from evil spell or similar ward. It is \nsuccessful only if the subject fails a saving \nthrow vs. spell with a special modifier (see \nfollowing). The saving throw is modified by \nsubtracting the combined Intelligence and \nWisdom scores of the target from those of \nthe wizard (Intelligence and hit dice in non- \nhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This \nmodifier is added to (or subtracted from) \nthe die roll. \nDifference Die Adjustment \n-9 or less +4 \n-8 to -6 +3 \n+13 or more -3 \nA negative score indicates that the wizard \nhas a lower total than the target, thus the \nhost has a saving throw bonus. Failure to \ntake over the host leaves the wizard’s life \nforce in the magic jar. \nIf successful, the caster’s life force occu- \npies the host body and the host’s life force is \nconfined in the magic jar receptacle. The \ncaster can call upon rudimentary or instinc- \ntive knowledge of the subject creature, but \nnot upon its real or acquired knowledge \n(i.e., the wizard does not automatically \nknow the language or spells of the creature). \nThe caster retains his own attack rolls, class \nknowledge and training, and any adjust- \nments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If \nthe host body is human or humanoid, and \nthe necessary spell components are availa- \nble, the wizard can even use his memorized \nspells. The host body retains its own hit \npoints and physical abilities and properties. \nThe DM decides if any additional modifica- \ntions are necessary; for example, perhaps \nclumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the cast- \ner must become used to the new form. The \nalignment of the host or receptacle is that of \nthe occupying life force. \nThe caster can shift freely from the host to \nthe receptacle if within the 10-feeVlevel \nrange. Each attempt to shift requires one \nround. The spell ends when the wizard \nshifts from the jar to his own body. \nA successful dispel magic spell cast on the \nhost can drive the caster of the magic jar \nspell back into the receptacle and prevent \nhim from making any attacks for ld4 \nrounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of \nthe dispel. The base success chance is 50%. \n+ / - 5 % per level difference between the \ncasters. A successful dispel magic cast \nagainst the receptacle forces the occupant \nback into his own body. If the wizard who \ncast the magic jar is forced back into his own \nbody, the spell ends. \nIf the host body is slain, the caster returns \nto the receptacle, if within range, and the \nlife force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). \nIf the host body is slain beyond the range of \nthe spell, both the host and the caster die, \nAny life force with nowhere to go is treat- \ned as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, \nresurrection, or similar spell. \nIf the body of the caster is slain, his life \nforce survives if it is in either the receptacle \nor the host. If the receptacle is destroyed \nwhile the caster’s life force occupies it, the \ncaster is irrevocably slain. \nMajor Creation (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nLike the minor creation spell, major crea- \ntion enables the wizard to pull wisps of \nmaterial from the plane of Shadow to create \nan item of nonliving, vegetable nature-soft \ngoods, rope, wood, etc. The wizard can also \ncreate mineral objects-stone, crystal, \nmetal, etc. The item created cannot exceed \none cubic foot per level of the spellcaster in \nvolume. The duration of the created item \nvaries with its relative hardness and rarity: \nVegetable matter 2 hours/level \nStone or crystal 1 hour/level \nPrecious metals 2 turns/level \nGems 1 turn/level \nMithral 2 rounddlevel \nAdamantite 1 round/level \n* Includes similar rare metals. \nAttempting to use any of these as material \ncomponents in a spell will cause the spell to \nfail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny \npiece of matter of the same type as the item \nhe plans to create-a bit of twisted hemp to \ncreate rope, a chip of stone to create a boul- \nder, and so on. \nMonster Surnrnoi \n(ConjurationBummoning) \nRange: 50 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/ievei \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \n’ \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld4 3rd-level monsters. These \nappear within spell range and attack the \ncaster’s opponents, until either he com- \nmands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale and vanish \nwhen slain. If no opponent exists to fight, \nand the wizard can communicate with \nthem, the summoned monsters can perform \nother services for the wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small candle. \nMordenkainen’s Faithful Hound \n(ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard sum- \nmons up a phantom watchdog that only he \ncan see. He may then command it to per- \nform as guardian of a passage, room, door, \nor similar space or portal. The phantom \nwatchdog immediately commences a loud \nbarking if any creature larger than a cat \napproaches the place it guards. As the faith- \nful hound is able to detect invisible creatures \nand ward against the approach of ethereal \ncreatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does \nnot react to illusions that are not at least \nquasi-real. \nIf the intruding creature exposes its back \nto the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious \nattack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, \nstriking for 3d6 points of damage. It is &le \nto hit opponents of all types, even those \nnormally subject only to magical weapons \nof +3 or greater. Creatures without backs \nare not attacked (ochre jellies, for instance). \nThe faithful hound cannot be attacked, but \nit can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maxi- \nmum of one hour plus 1/2 hour per caster \nlevel, but once it is activated by an intruder, \nit lasts only one round per caster level. If the \nspellcaster is ever more than 30 yards dis- \ntant from the area that the watchdog \nguards, the spell ends. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a \nthread. \n170\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 171 | PDF_PAGE 172]\nWizard Snells (5th Level) \nPuswall (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nA passwall spell enables the spellcaster to \nopen a passage through wooden, plaster, or \nstone walls, but not other materials. The \nspellcaster and any associates can simply \nwalk through. The spell causes a 5' wide x \n8' high x 10' deep opening. Several of these \nspells can form a continuing passage so that \nvery thick walls can be pierced. If dispelled, \nthe passwall closes away from the dispelling \ncaster, ejecting those in the passage. \nThe material component'of this spell is a \npinch of sesame seeds. \nSeeming (UusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 1Moot radius \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 12 hours \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 person/2 levels \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to alter the \nappearance of one person for every two \nlevels of experience he has attained. The \nchange includes clothing and equipment. \nThe caster can make the recipients appear as \nany generally man-shaped bipedal creature, \neach up to one foot shorter or taller than his \nnormal height, and thin or fat or in \nbetween. All those affected must resemble \nthe same general type of creature: human, \norc, ogre, etc. Each remains a recognizable \nindividual. The effect fails for an individual \nif the illusion chosen by the caster cannot be \naccomplished within the spell parameters \n[for example, a halfling could not be made \nto look like a centaur, but he might be made \nto look like a short, young ogre). Unwilling \npersons receive saving throws vs. spell to \navoid the effect. Affected persons resume \ntheir normal appearances if slain. The spell \nis not precise enough to duplicate the \nappearance of a specific individual. \n5ending (Evocation) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster can con- \ntact a single creature with whom he is famil- \niar and whose name and appearance are \nknown. If the creature in question is not on \nthe same plane of existence as the spellcast- \ner, there is a base 5% chance that the send- \ning does not amve. Local conditions on oth- \ner planes may worsen this chance \nconsiderably at the option of the DM. The \nsending, if successful, can be understood \neven by a creature with an Intelligence as \nlow as 1 (animal Intelligence). \nThe wizard can send a short message of 25 \nwords or less to the recipient. Also the recip- \nient can answer in like manner immediately. \nEven if the sending is received, the subject \ncreature is not obligated to act upon it in \nany manner. \nThe material component for this spell \nconsists of two tiny cylinders, each with one \nopen end, connected by a short piece of fine \ncopper wire. \nShadow Door (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \nthe illusion of a door. The illusion also per- \nmits the wizard to appear to step through \nthis \"door\" and disappear. In reality he has \ndarted aside and can flee, totally invisible, \nfor the spell duration. Creatures viewing \nthis are deluded into seeing or entering an \nempty 10' x 10' room if they open the \n\"door.\" A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, \nor similar magical means can discover the \nwizard. Certain high Hit Dice monsters \nmight also notice the wizard (see the invisi- \nbility spell), but only if making an active \nattempt to do so. \nShadow Magic (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 50 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe shadow magic spell enables the wiz- \nard to tap energy from the Shadow plane to \ncast a quasi-real wizard evocation spell of \n3rd level or less. For example, this spell can \nbe magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, or \nso on, and has normal effects upon crea- \ntures in the area of effect if they fail their \nsaving throws vs. spell. Thus a creature fail- \ning to save against a shadow magic fireball \nmust roll another saving throw, suffering \nhalf of the normal fireball damage if suc- \ncessful and full normal fireball damage if the \nsaving throw is failed. If the first saving \nthrow was successful, the shadow magic \nnature is detected and only 20% of the \nrolled damage is received (rounding down \nbelow fractions below .4 and rounding up \nI \nfractions of .4 and above). \nStone Shape (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard can \nform an existing piece of stone into a shape \nthat suits his purposes. For example, a stone \nweapon can be made, a special trapdoor \nfashioned, or an idol sculpted. This spell \ncan also enable the spellcaster to reshape a \nstone door so as to escape imprisonment, \nproviding the volume of stone involved was \nwithin the limits of the area of effect. While \nstone coffers can be thus formed and stone \ndoors made, the fineness of detail is not \ngreat. If the construction involves small \nmoving parts, there is a 30% chance they do \nnot function. \nThe material component of this spell is \nsoft clay that must be worked into roughly \nthe desired shape of the stone object and \nthen touched to the stone when the spell is \nuttered. \nSummon Shadow \n(Conjuration/SummoninG Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard con- \njures up one shadow (see the Monstrous \nCompendium) for every three levels of \nexperience he has attained. These monsters \nare under the control of the spell& and \nattack his enemies on command. The \nshadows remain until slain, turned, or the \nspell duration expires. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nbit of smoky quartz. \nI \nTelekinesis (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto move objects by concentrating on mov- \ning them mentally. The spell can provide \neither a gentle, sustained force or a single \nshort, violent thrust. \nA sustained force enables the wizard to \nmove a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance \n171\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 172 | PDF_PAGE 173]\nI- - \nrd Snells (5th 1 \nup to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two \nrounds, plus one round per caster level. The \nweight can be moved vertically, horizon- \ntally, or both. An object moved beyond the \ncaster's range falls or stops. If the caster \nceases concentration for any reason, the ob- \nject falls or stops. The object can be tele- \nkinetically manipulated as if with one hand. \nFor example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a \nkey can be turned, an object rotated and so \non, if the force required is within the weight \nlimitation. The caster might even be able to \nuntie simple knots, at the discretion of the \nDM. \nAlternatively, the spell energy can be ex- \npended in a single round. The caster can \nhurl one or more objects within range, and \nwithin a ten-foot cube, directly away from \nhimself at high speed, to a distance of up to \nten feet per caster level. This is subject to a \nmaximum weight of 25 pounds per caster \nlevel. Damage caused by hurled objects is \ndecided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 \npoint of damage per caster level. Opponents \nwho fall within the weight capacity of the \nspell can be hurled, but they are allowed a \nsaving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. \nFurthermore, those able to employ as simple \na counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for \nexample (thus making the body weight go \nover the maximum spell limit), can easily \ncounter the spell. The various Bigby's hand \nspells also counter this spell. \nTeleport (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is used, the wizard in- \nstantly transports himself, along with a cer- \ntain amount of additional weight that is on \nor being touched by the spellcaster, to a \nwell-known destination. Distance is not a \nfactor, but interplanar travel is not possible \nby means of a teleport spell. The spellcaster \nis able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 \npounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for \neach level of experience above the 10th (a \n13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 \npounds). If the destination area is very fa- \nmiliar to the wizard (he has a clear mental \npicture through actual proximity to and \nstudy of the area), it is unlikely that there is \nany error in arriving, although the caster \nhas no control over his facing upon arrival. \nLesser known areas (those seen only magi- \ncally or from a distance) increase the proba- \nbility of error. Unfamiliar areas present \nconsiderable peril (see table). \nProbability of \nTeleporting: \nOn \nDestination Is: High Target Low \nVery familiar 01-02 03-99 00 \nStudied carefully 0144 05-98 99-00 \nSeen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 \nViewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 \nNever seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 \nTeleporting high means the wizard arrives \nten feet above the ground for every 1% he is \nbelow the lowest \"On Target\" probability; \nthis could be as high as 320 feet if the desti- \nnation area was never seen. Any low result \nmeans the instant death of the wizard if the \narea into which he teleports is solid. A wiz- \nard cannot teleport to an area of empty \nspace-a substantial surface must be there, \nwhether a wooden floor, a stone floor, natu- \nral ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or \nmagical energies may make teleportation \nmore hazardous or even impossible. \nTransmute Rock to Mud (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: One 20-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell turns natural rock of any sort \ninto an equal volume of mud. The depth of \nthe mud can never exceed one-half its length \nor breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for ex- \nample, the rock affected collapses into mud. \nCreatures unable to levitate, fly, or other- \nwise free themselves from the mud sink at \nthe rate of ten feet per round and suffocate, \nexcept for light-weight creatures that could \nnormally pass across such ground. Brush \nthrown atop the mud can support creatures \nable to climb on top of it, with the amount \nof brush required subject to the DMs discre- \ntion. The mud remains until a dispel magic \nspell or a reverse of this spell, mud to rock, \nrestores its substance-but not necessarily \nits form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor- \nmal dirt, at the rate of ld6 days per ten cubic \nfeet. The mud to rock reverse can harden \nnormal mud into soft stone (sandstone or \nsimilar mineral) permanently unless magi- \ncally changed. \nThe material components for the spell are \nclay and water (or sand, lime, and water for \nthe reverse). \nWall of Force (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Up to 10-foot square/level \nSaving Throw: None \nA wall of force spell creates an invisible \nbarrier in the locale desired by the caster, up \nto the spell's range. The wall of force cannot \nmove and is totally unaffected by most \nspells, including dispel magic. But a disinte- \ngrate spell will immediately destroy it, as \nwill a rod of cancellation or a sphere of anni- \nhilation. Likewise, the wall of force is not \naffected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, elec- \ntricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons can- \nnot pass through it in either direction, \nalthough dimension door, teleport, and \nsimilar effects can bypass the barrier. \nThe wizard can, if desired, form the wall \ninto a spherical shape with a radius up to \none foot per level or to an open hemispheri- \ncal shape of 1.5-foot radius per caster level. \nThe wall of force must be continuous and \nunbroken when formed; if its surface is bro- \nken by any object or creature, the spell fails. \nThe caster can end the spell on command. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of powdered diamond worth 5,000 \ngP. \nWall of \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 15 square feet/level or \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard causes \na vertical iron wall to spring into being. This \nwall can be used to seal off a passage or \nclose a breach, for the wall inserts itself into \nany surrounding nonliving material if its \narea is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is \n1/4 inch thick per level of experience of the \nspellcaster. The wizard is able to create an \narea of iron wall up to 15 square feet for \neach of his experience levels, so at 12th level \na wall of iron 180 square feet in area can be \ncreated. The wizard can double the wall's \narea by halving its thickness. \nIf the caster desires, the wall can be cre- \nated vertically resting on a flat surface, SO \nthat it can be tipped over, to fall on and \ncrush any creature beneath it. The wall is \n50% likely to tip in either direction. This \nchance can be modified by a force of not less \nthan 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass- \neach pound over 400 or Strength point over \n30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the \nstronger side. Creatures with room to flee \nthe falling wall may do so by making suc- \n172\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 173 | PDF_PAGE 174]\ncessful saving throws vs. death. Those \nfail are killed. Huge and gargantuan crea- \ntures cannot be crushed by the wall. \nThe wall is permanent, unless success- \nfully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a \nnod iron wall is subject to-rust, perfo- \nration, etc. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall piece of sheet iron. \nWall of Stone (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates a wall of granite rock \nthat merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It \nis typically employed to close passages, por- \ntals, and breaches against opponents. The \nwall of stone is 1/4 inch thick and up to 20 \nsquare feet per level of experience of the \nwizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level \nwizard can create a wall of stone three \ninches thick and up to 240 square feet in sur- \nface area (a =-foot-wide and 20-foot-high \nwall, for example, to completely close a 10’ \nX 16’ passage). The wall created need not \nbe vertical nor need it rest upon any firm \nfoundation (see the wull of iron spell); how- \never, it must merge with and be solidly sup- \nported by existing stone. It can be used to \nbridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. \nFor this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, \nthe wall must be arched and buttressed. \nThis requirement reduces the area of effect \nby half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create \na span with a surface area of 200 square feet. \nThe wall can be crudely shaped to allow \ncrenelations, battlements, and 80 forth by \nlikewise reducing the area. The stone is per- \nmanent unless destroyed by a dispel magic \nspell or a disintegmte spell, or by normal \nmeans such as breaking or chipping. \nThe material component is a small block \nof granite. \nSixth-Level Spells \nAnti-Magic Shell (Abjuration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: l’/level diameter sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard sur- \nrounds himself with an invisible barrier that \nmoves with him. The area within this bar- \nrier is totally impervious to all magic and \nmagical spell effects, thus preventing the \npassage of spells or their effects. Likewise it \nprevents the functioning of any magical \nitems or spells within its confines. The area \nis also impervious to breath weapons, gaze \nor voice attacks, and similar special attack \nforms. \nThe anti-magic shell also hedges out \ncharmed, summoned, or conjured crea- \ntures. It cannot, however, be forced against \nany creature that it would keep at bay; any \nattempt to do creates a discernible pressure \nagainst the barrier, and continued pressure \nwill break the spell. Normal creatures (a \nnormally encountered troll rather than one \nconjured up, for instance) can enter the \narea, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, \nwhile a magical sword does not function \nmagically within the area, it is still a sword. \nNote that creatures on their home plane are \nnormal creatures there. Thus on the elemen- \ntal plane of Fire, a randomly encountered \nfire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this \nspell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of \n173 \ndemigod or higher status are unaffected by \nmortal magic such as this. \nShould the caster be larger than the area \nenclosed by the barrier, parts of his person \nmay be considered exposed, at the referee’s \noption. A dispel magic spell does not re- \nmove the spell; the caster can end it upon \ncommand. \nBigby’s Forceful Hand (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nArea of Effect: special \n‘ Casting Time: 6 \nSaving Throw: None \nBaby‘s forceful hand is a more powerful \nversion of Bigby’s interposing hand. It cre \nates a man-sized (five feet) to gargantuan- \nsized (21 feet) hand that places itself \nbetween the spellcaster and a chosen oppo- \nnent. This disembodied hand then moves to \nremain between the two, regardless of what \nthe spellcaster does or how the oppomt \ntries to get around it. However, the forceful \nhand also pushes on the opponent. This \nforce can push away a creature weighing \n500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 \nfeet per round if the creature weighs be- \ntween 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow move- \nment by 50% if the creature weighs more \nthan 2,000 pounds. \nA creature pushed away is pushed to the \nrange limit, or until pd an un- \nyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no \ndamage. The forceful hand has an Armor \nClass of 0, has as many hit points as its \ncaster in full health, and vanishes whar dq- \nstroyed. The caster can cause it to retmat (to \nrelease a trapped opponent, for exampie) or \ndismiss it on command. \nThe material component is a glove. \nChain Lightning (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nThis spell creates an electncai arscmrge \nthat begins as a single stroke of lightning, \n2% feet wide, commencing from the finger- \ntips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt \nspell, chain lightning strikes one object or \ncreature initially, then arcs to a series of \nother objects or creatures within range, los- \ning energy with each jump. \nThe bolt initially inflicts ld6 points of \ndamage per level of the caster, to a maxi- \nmum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or \ncreature rolls a successful saving throw vs. \nspell). After the first strike, the lightning \narcs to the next nearest object or creature. \nt\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 174 | PDF_PAGE 175]\nEach jump reduces the strength of the light- \nning by ld6. Each creature or magical object \nhit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success \non this save indicates the creature suffers \nonly half damage from the bolt. \nThe chain can strike as many times (in- \ncluding the first object or creature) as the \nspell caster has levels, although each crea- \nture or object can be struck only once. \nThus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can \nstrike up to 12 times, causing less damage \nwith each strike, The bolt continues to arc \nuntil it has struck the appropriate number of \nobjects or creatures, until it strikes an object \nthat grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of \na large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, \netc.), or until there are no more objects or \ncreatures to strike. \nDirection is not a consideration when \nplotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a \nfactor-an arc cannot exceed the spell's \nrange. If the only possible arc is greater than \nthe spell's range, the stroke fades into noth- \ningness. Creatures immune to electrical at- \ntack can be struck, even though no damage \nis taken. Note that it is possible for the chain \nto arc back to the caster! \nThe material components are a bit of fur, \na piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and \none silver pin for each experience level of \nthe caster. \nConJure Animals \n(ConjwatiodSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe conjure animals spell enables the wiz- \nard to magically create one or more mam- \nmals to attack his opponents. The total Hit \nDice of the mammals cannot exceed twice \nhis level, if determined randomly, or his \nlevel if a specific animal type is requested \n(see the Dungeon Muster's Guide). Thus, a \nwizard of 12th level could randomly conjure \ntwo mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6 \nHit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight \nwith 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice \neach, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every \n+1 hit point bonus of a creature as 114 of a \nHit Die, thus a creature with 4 +3 Hit Dice \nequals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The con- \njured animal(s) remain for one round for \neach level of the conjuring wizard, or until \nslain. They follow the caster's verbal com- \nmands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack \nthe wizards opponents, but they resist being \nused for any other purpose. \nContingency (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto place another spell upon his person so \nthat the latter spell will come into effect un- \nder the conditions dictated during the cast- \ning of the contingency spell. The \ncontingency spell and the spell it is to bring \ninto effect are cast at the same time (the one- \nturn casting time indicated is the total for \nboth castings). \nThe spell to be brought into effect by the \nprescribed contingency must be one that af- \nfects the wizards peison (feather fall, levita- \ntion, fly, feign death, etc.) and is of a spell \nlevel no higher than V3 of the caster's experi- \nence level (rounded down), but not higher \nthan the 6th spell level. \nCaster Level Contingency Spell Level \n12th-14th 4th \n15th-17th 5th \n18th + 6th \nOnly one contingency spell can be placed \non the spellcaster at any one time; if a sec- \nond is cast, the first one (if still active) is \ncancelled. The conditions needed to bring \nthe spell into effect must be clear, although \nthey can be rather general. For example, a \ncontingency spell cast with an airy water \nspell might prescribe that any time the wiz- \nard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in \nwater or similar liquid, the airy water spell \nwill instantly come into effect. Or a contin- \ngency could bring a feather fall spell into ef- \nfect any time the wizard falls more than two \nfeet. In all cases, the contingency immedi- \nately brings into effect the second spell, the \nlatter-being \"cast\" instantaneously when the \nprescribed circumstances occur. Note \nthat if complicated or convoluted condi- \ntions are prescribed, the whole spell com- \nplex (the contingency spell and the cbmpan- \nion magic) may fail when called upon. \nThe material components of this spell are \n(in addition to those of the companion spell) \n100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash \nof an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell- \nusing creature. In addition, the speU re- \nquires a statuette of the wizard carved from \nelephant ivory (which is not destroyed, \nthough it is subject to wear and tear), which \nmust be carried on the person of the spell- \ncaster for the contingency spell to perfom \nits function when called upon. \nControl Weather (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4d6 hours \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 4d4 square miles \nSaving Throw: None \nThe control mather spell enables a wiz- \nard to change the weather in the local area. \nThe spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours \nin an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires \none turn to cast the spell, and an additional \nld4 turns for the weather conditions to oc- \ncur. The current weather conditions are de- \ncided by the DM, depending on the climate \nand season. Weather conditions have three \ncomponents: precipitation, temperature, \nand wind. The spell can change these condi- \ntions according to the following chart. \nThe upper-cased headings reprosent the \nexisting weather conditions. The small \nheadings beneath each large heading are the \nnew conditions to which the caster can \nchange the existing conditions. Further- \nmore, the caster can control the direction of \nthe wind. For example, a day that is clear \nand warm with moderate wind can be con- \ntrolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con- \ntradictions are not possible-fog and strong \nwind, for example.

The vapors \nare deadly to living things, so that vegeta- \ntion exposed to them will die-grass and \nsimilar small plants in two rounds, bushes \nand shrubs in four, small trees in eight, and \nlarge trees in 16 rounds. Animal life not \nimmune to acid suffers damage according to \nthe length of time it is exposed to the vapors \nof a death fog, as follows: \n1st round: 1 point \n2nd round: 2 points \n3rd round: 4 points \n4th and each succeeding round: 8 points \nThe death fog otherwise resembles the \n2nd-level fog cloud: rolling, billowing \nvapors that can be moved only by a very \nstrong wind. Any creature attempting to \nmove through the death fog progresses at a \nrate of but one foot per unit of normal \nmovement rate per round. A gust of wind \nspell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame \nstrike, or a wall of fire can bum it away in a \nsingle round. \nThe material components are a pinch of \ndried and powdered peas, powdered animal \nhoof, and strong acid of any sort (including \nhighly distilled vinegar or acid crystals), \nwhich must be obtained from an alchemist. \nange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nuration: Instantaneous \nArea of Effect: One 30-fOOt cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a death spell is cast, it snuffs out \ne forces of creatures in the area of effect \ntantly and irrevocably. Such creatures \not be raised or resurrected, but an indi- \nidual slain in this manner might be brought \nack via a wish. The number of creatures \ncan be slain is a function of their-Hit \nMaximum # of \nCreatures‘ Hit Dice Creatures Affected \nUnder 2 4d20 \n2 to 4 2d20 \n4+1 to 6+3 2d4 \n6+4 to 8+3 ld4 \nIf creatures of differing Hit Dice are \nattacked with a death spell, roll the dice \n(4d20) to determine how many creatures of \nunder 2 Hit Dice are affected. If the number \nrolled is greater than the actual number of \nsub-2 Hit Dice creatures, apply the remain- \nder of the roll to the hlgher Hit Dice crea- \ntures by consulting the following table. \nConversion \nCreature’s Hit Dice Factor (CF) \nUnder 2 1 \n2 to 4 2 \n4+1 to6+3 10 \n6+4 to 8+3 20 \nIn other words, from the 4d20 roll sub- \ntract the number of creatures of less than 2 \nHit Dice (these creatqres die). If there are \nany remaining points from the 4d20 roll, \nsubtract 2 for each creature of 2 to 4 Hit \nDice (these creatures also die). If this still \ndoesn’t use up all the 4d20 roll, subtract 10 \nfor each creature of 4 +1 to 6 +3 Hit Dice, \nand so on. Stop when all the creatures are \ndead, all the 4d20 roll is used up, or the \nremainder is less than 1/z of the CF of any \nremaining creatures. (If the remainder is 1/z \nor more of the CF of a creature, that crea- \nture dies.) \nExample: A mixed group of 20 goblins, \neight gnolls, and four ogres, led by a hill \ngiant, are caught in the area of a death spell. \nThe 4d20 roll gives a total of 53 points; 20 of \nthis eliminates the goblins (20 x 1 CF), 16 \nkills the gnolls (8 x 2 CF), and the remain- \ning 17 kills two ogres (10 points to kill one \nogre, and the remaining 7 points are enough \nto kill one more ogre). The other two ogres \nand the hill giant are unharmed. \nA death spell does not affect lycan- \nthropes, undead creatures, or creatures \nfrom planes other than the Prime Material. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ncrushed black pearl with a minimum value \nof 1,Ooo gp. \nDemi-Shadow Magi<! \n(IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to the 5th-level \nshndow magic spell, but this spell enables \nthe casting of partially real 4th- and 5th \nlevel evocations (cone of cold, wall Of fire, \nwall of ice, cloudkill, etc.). If recognized as \ndemi-shadow magic (if a saving throw vs. \nspell is successful), damaging spells inflict \nonly 40% of nod damage, with a mini- \nmum of 2 points per die of damage. A demi- \nmagic cloudkill days creatures with kwor \nthan 2 Hit Dice and inflicts Id2 points of \ndamage per round. \nDisintegrate (Alteration) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell causes matter to vanish. It \naffects even matter (or energy) of a magical \nnature, such as Bigby’s forceful hand, but \nnot a globe of invulnerability or an anti- \nmagic shell. Disintegration is instmtane- \nous, and its effects are permanent. Any \nsingle creature can be affected, even \nundead. Nonliving matter, up to a 10’ x 10’ \nx 10’ cube, can be obliterated by the spell. \nThe spell creates a thin, green ray that \ncauses physical material touched to glow \nand vanish, leaving traces of fine dust, \nCreatures that successfully save vs. spell \nhave avoided the ray (materid items have \nresisted the magic) and are not affected. \nOnly the first creature or object struck can \nbe affected. \nThe material components are a lodestone \nand a pinch of dust. \nI \nEnchant an Itern \n(Enchantment, Invocation) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 item \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis is a spell that must be used by a wiz- \nard planning to create a magical item. The \nenchant an item spell prepares the object to \naccept the magic. The item must meet the \nfollawing tests: 1) it must be in sound and \nundamaged condition; 2) the item must be \nthe finest possible, considering its nature, \ni.e., crafted of the highest quality material \nand with the finest workmanship; 3) its cost \nor value must reflect the second test, and in \nmost cases the item must have a raw- \nmaterials cost in excess of 100 gp. With \nrespect to requirement 3, it is not possible to \napply this test to items such as ropes, leather \ngoods, cloth, and pottery not normally \nembroidered, bejeweled, tooled, carved, or \nengraved. If such work or materials can be \nadded to an item without weakening or \nharming its normal functions, however, \nI\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 176 | PDF_PAGE 177]\n-r \"i \n1 \nP \n1 I \nthese are required for the item to be \nenchanted. \nThe wizard must have access to a work- \nshop or laboratory, properly equipped and \nfrom which contaminating magic can be \nscreened. Any magical item not related to \nthe fabrication process (such as most pro- \ntective devices) and within 30 feet of the \nmaterials is a source of contaminating magic \nand will spoil the process. \nThe item to be prepared must be touched \nby the spell caster. This touching must be \nconstant and continual during the casting \ntime, which is a base 16 hours plus an addi- \ntional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never \nwork more than eight hours per day, and \nhaste or any other spells will not alter the \ntime required in any way, this effectively \nmeans that casting time for this spell is two \ndays + ld8 days). All work must be unin- \nterrupted, and during rest periods the item \nbeing enchanted must never be more than \none foot distant from the spellcaster, for if it \nis, the whole spell is spoiled and must be \nbegun again. (Note that during rest periods \nabsolutely no other form of magic can be \nperformed, and the wizard must remain qui- \net and in isolation or the enchantment is \nruined.) \nAt the end of the spell, the caster will \nknow that the item is ready for the final test. \nHe will then pronounce the final magical \nsyllable, and if the item makes a saving \nthrow (which is exactly the same as that of \nthe wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. \nThe spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also \napply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on \nthe ldzo roll always results in failure, \nregardless of modifications. Once the spell \nis finished, the wizard can begm to place the \ndesired spell upon the item. The spell he \nplans to place must be cast within 24 hours \nor the preparatory spell fades, and the item \nmust be enchanted again. \nEach spell subsequently cast upon ' an \nobject bearing an enchant an item spell \nrequires 2d4 hours per spell level of the mag- \nic being cast. Again, during casting the item \nmust be touched by the wizard, and during \nthe rest periods it must always be within one \nfoot of his person. This procedure holds \ntrue for any additional spells placed upon \nthe item, and each successive spell must be \nbegun within 24 hours of the last, even if the \nprior spell failed. \nNo magic placed on an item is permanent \nunless a permanency spell is used as a finish- \ning touch. This always runs a 5% risk of \ndraining 1 point of Constitution from the \nwizard casting the spell. Also, while it is \npossible to tell when the basic spell (enchunt \nan item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if \nsuccessive castings actually work, for each \nmust make the same sort of saving throw as \nthe item itself made. Naturally, items that \nare charged-rods, staves, wands, javelins \nof lightning, ring of wishes, etc.-can never \nbe made permanent, Magical devices can- \nnot be used to enchant an item or cast magic \nupon an object so prepared, but scrolls can \nbe used for this purpose. \nThe materials needed for this spell vary \naccording to both the nature of the item \nbeing enchanted and the magic to be cast \nupon it. For example, a cloak of displace- \nment might require the hides of one or more \ndisplacer beasts, a sword meant to slay \ndragons could require the blood and some \nother part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will \nbe effective against, and a ring of shooting \nstars might require pieces of meteorites and \nthe horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well \nas other information pertaining to this spell, \nare decided by your Dungeon Master and \nmust be discovered or researched in \nEnsnarement (Conjuration/Summoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nCasting this spell attempts a dangerous \nact: to lure a powerful creature from \nanother plane to a specially prepared trap, \nwhere it will be held until It agrees to.per- \nform one service in return for freedom from \nthe ensnarement spell. The type of creature \nto be ensnared must be known and stated, \nand if it has a specific, proper, or given \nname, this must be used in casting the \nensnarement spell. The spell causes an \nawareness of a gate-like opening on the \nplane of the creature to be ensnared. A spe- \ncial saving throw is then made to determine \nif the creature detects the nature of the pla- \nnar opening as a trap or believes it to be a \ngate. To save, the creature must roll equal to \nor less than its Intelligence score on ld20. \nThe score is modified by the difference \nbetween the creature's Intelligence and that \nof the spellcaster. If the creature has a lugher \nscore, the difference is subtracted from its \ndice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a high- \ner score, the difference is added to the dice \nroll. \nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature \nignores the spell-created opening, and the \nspell fails. If the saving throw fails, the crea- \nture steps into the opening and is ensnared. \nWhen so trapped, the other-planar crea- \nture can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, \nunless the caster has created a warding cir- \ncle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn \nby hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). \nEven with such protection, the entrapped \ncreature may break free and wreak its \nvengeance upon the spellcaster. \nA hand-drawn circle has a base failure \nchance of 20 % , while one inlaid or carved \nhas a base of 10% (and that is for the first \ntime it is used, to determine whether or not \nthe job was done properly). The base \nchance is modified by the difference. \nbetween the wizard's combined Intelligence \nand experience level and the Intelligence and \nthe experience level or Hit Dice of the crea- \nture ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher \ntotal, that difference in percentage points is \nsubtracted from the chance for the creature \nto break free. If the creature has a higher \ntotal, that difference is added to 2s chance \nto break free. \nThe chance can be further reduced by \ncareful preparation of the circle. If the hand: \nmade circle is drawn over a longer period d \ntime, using specially prepared pigments \n(1,OOO gp value per turn spent drawing), the \nchance of breaking free is reduced by 1 % for \nevery turn spent iq preparation. This can \nbring the base chance to 0%. \nSimilarly, an inlaid or carved design can \na minimum of one full month of time and \nadd not less than 50,OOO gp to the basic cost \nof having the circle inlaid or carved into \nstone. Any break in the circle spoils the effi- \ncacy of the spell and enables the creature to \nbreak free automatically. Even a straw \ndropped across the line of a magic circle \ndestroys its power. Fortunately, the creature \nwithin cannot so much as place a straw \nupon any portion of the inscribed ward, for \nthe magic of the barrier absolutely prevents \nit. \nOnce safely ensnared, the creature can be \nkept for as long as the spellcaster dares. \n(Remember the danger of something break- \ning the ward!) The creature cannot leave the \ncircle, nor can any of its attacks or powers \npenetrate the barrier. The caster can offer \nbribes, use promises, or make threats in \norder to exact one service from the zaptive \ncreature. \nThe DM will then assign a value to what \nthe wizard has said to the ensnared creature, \nrating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most \npersuasive). This rating is then subtracted \nfrom the Intelligence score of the cream. If \nthe creature rolls a successful Intelligence \ncheck against its adjusted Intelligence, it \nrefuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can \nbe made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours \nlater, when the creature's Intelligence has \ndropped by 1 point due to confinement. \nThis can be repeated until the creature \npromises to serve, until it breaks free, or \nuntil the caster decides to get rid of it by \nmeans of some riddance spell. Impossible \ndemands or unreasonable commands are \nnever agreed to. \nOnce the single service is completed, the \ncreature need only so inform the spellcaster \nto be instantly sent from whence it came. \nThe creature might later seek revenge. \n176\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 177 | PDF_PAGE 178]\nWizard Snells (6th Level) \nHI (Alteration) \nRange. 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Jiffect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is the same as the 4th-level \natension 1 spell, except that it will extend \n1st- through 3rd-level spells to double dura- \ntion and will extend the duration of 4th- or \n5th-level spells by 50 % . \nEyeblte (EnchantmentlChann, \nIllwionlPhantarm) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/3 levels \nCasting Tie: 6 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nAn eyebite spell enables the caster to \nmerely meet the gaze of a creature and speak \na single word to cause an effect. This gaze \nattack is in addition to any other attacks \nallowed the wizard. The wizard selects one \nof four possible gaze attacks at the time the \nspell is cast, and this attack cannot be \nchanged. For example, a 12th-level caster \nwho chose fear would have four opportunl- \nties to make gaze attacks causing fear, one \nfor each round of the spell's duration. Any \ngaze attack is negated by a successful saving \nthrow vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. \nThe four effects of the spell are as follows: \nCharm: The wizard can charm a single \nperron or monster by gaze and by uttering a \nsingle word. The effect is to make the \nchd subject absolutely loyal and docile \nto the caster, even to the point of personal \ndanger. It is otherwise the same as a charm \nmonster spell. All creatures other than \nhumans, demihumans, and humanoids save \nwith +2 bonuses. \nFear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze \nand by qeahg a single word. The subject \nflees in blind terror for ld4 rounds. After \nthis, the creature refuses to face the caster \nand cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if \nsubsequently confronted by the caster (50% \nchance of either). The latter effect lasts one \nturn per caster level. This attack can be \nnegated by spells that counter fenr. \nSicken: This power enables the caster to \nmerely gaze, speak a word, and cause sud- \nden pain and fever to sweep over the sub- \nject's body. Creatures with ability scores \nfunction at half effectiveness, others inflict \nonly onehalf damage with physical attacks. \nMovement is at one-half normal rate. The \nsubject remains stridcm for one turn per \nlevel of the caster, after which all abilities \nreturn at the rate of one point per turn of \ncomplete rest or one point per hour of mod- \nerate activity. The effects cannot be negated \nby a cure diseuse or heat spell, but a remove \ncurse or successful dispel magic spell is \neffective. Creatures other than hm, \ndemihumans, and humanoids save with +2 \nbonuses versus this attack. \nSleep: The wizard can cause any individ- \nual to fall into a comatose slumber by means \nof a gaze and a single word, unless the sub- \nject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. \nspell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st- \nlevel sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An \naffected creature must be shaken or other- \nwise shocked back to consciousness. \nIn all cases, the gaze attack has a speed \nfactor of 1. This spell does not affect undead \nof any type, or extend beyond the plane \noccupied by the caster. Note that the caster \nis subject to the effects of his reflected gaze, \nand is allowed any applicable saving throw. \nIn the case of a reflected charm gaze, the \ncaster is paralyzed until it wears off or is \ncountered. \nGeao (EnchantmenKham) \nRange: IO yards \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nA gem spell places a magical command \nupon a creature (usually human or human- \noid) to carry out some service, or to refrain \nfrom some action or course of activity, as \ndesired by the spellcaster. The creature must \nbe intelligent, conscious, under its own voli- \ntion, and able to understand the caster. \nWhile a geas cannot compel a creature to \nkill itself or to perform acts that are likely to \nresult in certain death, it can cause almost \nany other course of action. The ged crea- \nture must follow the given instructions until \nthe geas is completed. Failure to do so will \ncause the creature to grow sick and die with- \nin ld4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of \nthe instructions causes corresponding loss \nof Strength points until the deviation ceases. \nA geas can be done away with by a wish \nspell, but a dispel magic or remove curse \nspell will not negate it. Your DM will decide \nany additional details of a geas, for its cast- \ning and fulfillment are tricky, and an \nimproperly cast geas is ignored. \n. \nGlusee (Alteration) \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto make a section of metal, stom, or wood \nas transparent as glass to his gaze, or even \nmake it into transparent material as \nexplained hereafter. Normally, up to four \ninches of metal can be seen through, stone \nup to six inches thick can be made transpar- \nby the g&ssee spell. The spell will not work \non lead, gold, or platinum. The wizard can \nopt to make the glassee work only for him- \nself for the duration of the @, or he can \nactually make a transparent area, a one- \nway window, in the materid affected. \nEther case gives a viewing area 3' wideby 2' \nhigh.

The ward protects a one-storey stronghold, \nwith a base dimension of 400‘ X 400’. The \nwizard can ward a multi-storey area by \nreducing the base area proportionately. The \nfollowing take place in the warded area \nupon casing of the spell: \n1. All corridors become misty, and visibil- \nity is reduced to 10 feet. \n2. All doors are wizard locked. \n3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to \nbottom. These act as the 2nd-level web \nspell, except that they regrow within one \nturn if destroyed. \n4.

The whole area radiates magic. The nor- \nmal use of the detect magic spell becomes \nimpossible for those of less than the cast- \ner’s level and difficult for others. \n6. One door per level of experience of the \nwizard is covered by an illusion to \nappear as if it were a plain wall. \n7. The wizard can place one of the follow- \ning additional magical effects: \nA. Dancing fights in four corridors \nB. Magic mouth in two places \nC. Stinking cloud in two places \nD. Gust of wind in one corridor or room \nE. Suggestion in one place. \nNote that items 6 and 7 function only \nwhen the wizard is totally familiar with the \narea of the spell’s effect. &pel magic can \nremove one effect, at random, per casting. \nA remove curse spell will not work. \nThe material components of the spell are \nburning incense, a small measure of sulphur \nand oil, a knotted string, a small amount of \number hulk blood, and a small silver rod. \nA \nA \nInvisible Stalker \n(Conjur~tio@arnmoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell summons an invisible stalker \nfrom the elemental plane of Air. This 8 Hit \nDice monster obeys and serves the spellcast- \ner in performing whatever tasks are set \nbefore it. It is a faultless tracker within one \nday of the quarry’s passing. The invisible \nstalker follows instructions even if they send \nhim hundreds ‘or thousands of miles away \nand, once given an order, follows through \nunceasingly until the task is accomplished. \nHowever, the creature is bound to serve; it \ndoes not do so from loyalty or desire. \nTherefore, it resents prolonged missions or \ncomplex tasks, and it attempts to pervert \ninstructions accordingly. Invisible stalkers \nunderstand common speech but speak no \nlanguage save their own. \nThe material components of this spell are \nburning incense and a piece of horn carved \ninto a crescent shape. \nLegend Lore (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe legend lore spell is used to determine \nlegendary information regarding a known \nperson, place, or thing. If the person or \nthing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the \nplace in question, the likelihood of the spell \nproducing results is far greater and the cast- \ning time is only ld4 turns. If only detailed \ninformation on the person, place, or thing is \nknown, casting time is Idlo days. If only \nrumors are known, casting time is 2d6 \nWeeks. \nDuring the casting, the wizard cannot \nengage in activities other than the routine: \neating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the \ndivination reveals if legendary material is \navailable. It often reveals where this materi- \nal is-by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It \nsometimes gives certain information regard- \ning the person, place, or thing (when the \nobject of the fegend fore is at hand), but this \ndata is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, \nriddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). \nThe spell is cast with incense and strips of \nivory formed into a rectangle, but some \nitem of value to the caster must be sacrificed \nin addition-a potion, magical scroll, magi- \ncal item, etc. \nNaturally, legend fore reveals informa- \ntion only if the person, place, or thing is \nnoteworthy or legendary. \nSuppose Delsenora came across an \nextremely well-made sword. It radiates \nmagic, but when she used an identify spell, \nshe could not leam any information. Even \ngiving it to a trusted fighter didn’t work as \nthe sword did not reveal any special \npowers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, \nhoping to gain more hformation. Since the \nsword is at hand, she completes the spell in \nthree turn. In her mind comes the message, \n”Once this was the sword of he who waits \ntill Albion‘s time of greatest peril, when \nunto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the \nhand that gave me and fair was the hand \nthat reclaimed me.” Clearly, Delsenora rcaE \nizes, this must be a very powerful item, \nsince her spell gave only a cryptic answer. \nBut who is he who waits? And where is \nAlbion? For more information, Delsenora is \ngoing to have to cast more spells. But now \nthe process will take quch longer, since she \nhas only the vaguest of clues to follow. \nLower Water (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 tum \nArea of Effect: 10-foot square arealleve1 \nSaving Throw: None \nThe wizard casting a low water spell \ncad water or similar fluid in the area of \neffect to sink away. The water can be krwered \nup to two feet for every experience kvcl of \nthe wizard, to a minimum depth of one inch. \nThe water is lowered within a square area \nwhose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. \nThus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume \n24’ x 120’ x m’, a 13th-levd casta a vol- \nume of 26’ X 130‘ X la’, and so on. In \nextremely large and deep bodies of water, \nsuch as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl- \npool that sweeps ships and similar aaft \ndownward, putting them at risk and render- \ning them unable to leave by normal mom- \nment for the duration of the spell.’b cast \non water dement;lEs and other water-based \ncreatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: the \ncreature moves at half speed and +half \nthe number of attacks each round. It has no \neffect on other creatures. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall vial of dust. \nIts reverse, raise water, causes water or \nsimilar fluids to return to their highest natu- \nral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This \ncan make fords impassable, float grounded \nships, and may even sweep away bridges at \nthe referee‘s option. It negates lower wuter \nand vice versa. \nThe material component of the raise \nwater spell is a small vial of water.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 179 | PDF_PAGE 180]\nMass Suggestion \n(EnchantmenVChann) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 4 turns + 4 turns/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature/level \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe mass suggestion spell enables the wiz- \nard to influence the actions of one or more \nchosen creatures in the same way as the sug- \ngestion spell. Up to one creature per experi- \nence level of the caster can be influenced, \nprovided that all subject creatures are with- \nin the -yard range. Undead are not subjed \nto this spell. The suggestion must be reason- \nably worded and understood by the crea- \ntures, and must be the same for all hearing \nit. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are \nunaffected. Saving throws against the spell \nsuffer a penalty of - 1, and if a single crea- \nture is to be affected, its saving throw suf- \nfers a -4 penalty. Note that a very \nreasonable mass suggestion can cause the \nsaving throw to be made with an additional \npenalty (such as - 1, -2, etc.) at the discre- \ntion of your DM. A mass suggestion can \ncontinue in effect for a considerable dura- \ntion, at the DMs discretion. Conditions that \nwill trigger a special action can also be speci- \nfied; if the condition is not met before the \nspell expires, then the action will not be per- \nformed. \nThe material components of this spell are \na snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- \ncomb or a drop of sweet oil. \nMirage Arcma \n(Illualon/F'hantasm, Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S,(M optional) \nDuration: Special \nC+$ng Time: Special \nha of Effect: 10 feet/level radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThe magic of this spell is similar to that of \nthe oucuncy spell, only this is more power- \nful and elaborate. The spell enables the cast- \ner to make an area appear to be something \nother than it is, a setting he has personally \nseen. The spell remains as long as the caster \nmaintains a minimal concentration upon it. \nEven after this, the speIl persists for a total \nof one hour plus one additional turn for \neach experience level of the caster. (Note: \nMinimal concentration can be maintained \nduring normal conversation but not while \nspellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an \nattack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit \nof anything connected with the place to cre- \nate this spell, then it takes on a quasi-reality. \nIn its basic form, forceful contact is neces- \nsary to have any hope of discovering the \nmagic, short of a detection device or spell. \nIn its more complex form, where a material \ncomponent is used, detection is possible \nonly by some magical means, whether \ndevice, item, or spell. Either form of mirage \narcana is subject to the dispel magic spell. \nAs with all powerful illusions, the mind \nof the believer urges appropriate effects \nupon the viewer's body. Under the influence \nof the spell, the viewer could possibly walk \nacross a bed of hot coals thinking it was a \nshallow stream of water that was cooling his \nfeet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon \nimaginary food and actually be satisfied, or \nrest comfortably upon a bed of sharp \nstones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is \nnot affected by the spell, however, so that \nan envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm \ndoes not support the believer. Those who \nwitness the event see it as a sudden disap- \npearance of the individual. They do not \nconnect it with an illusion unless they are \notherwise aware of some magic at work. \nMislead (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponent: S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special . \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a mislead spell is cast by the wiz- \nard, he actually creates an illusory double at \nthe same time that he is cloaked by \nimproved invisibility magic (see the 4th- \nlevel spell). The wizard is then free to go \nelsewhere while his double seemingly moves \naway. The spell enables the illusion of the \nwizard to speak and gesture as if it were \nreal, and there are full olfactory and touch \ncomponents as well. A tnre seeing spell or a \ngem of seeing will reveal the illusion for \nwhat it is. A detect invisibility or true seeing \nspell, or items such as a gem of seeing or \nrobe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard \n(see the 5th-level wizard spell, shadow \ndoor). \nMonster Summoning IV \n(Conjuration/Summoning)g) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld3 4th-level monsters. These \nappear within spell range and attack the \ncaster's opponents, until he commands them \nto cease, the spell duration expires, or the \nmonsters are slam. These creatures do not \n179 179 \n- \ncheck morale; they vanish when slain. If no \nopponent exists to fight, summoned mon- \nsters can, if the wizard can communicate \nwith them, and if they are physically capit- \nble, perform other services for the summon- \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessrrily lit) \ncandle. \ning wizard. \nMordenkdnen's Lucubfatlon \n(Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of this spell, the wizard is able to \ninstantly recall any 1st- through sth-level \nspell he has used during the past 24 hours. \nThe spell must have been memorized and \nactually used during that time period. Mor- \ndenkainen's lucubration allows the recovery \nof only one spell. If the recalled spell \nrequires material components, these must \nbe provided by the caster; the rec~ved \nspell is not usable until the material compo- \nnents are available. \nMove Earth (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen cast, the move earth spe~ moves \ndirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other compo- \nnents. Thus embankments can be collapsed, \nhillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. How- \never, in no event can rock prominences be \ncollapsed or moved. The area to be affected \ndictates the casting time; for every 40 yd. x \n40 yd. surface area and 10 feet of depth, one \nturn of casting time is required. The maxi- \nmum area that can be affected is 240 yd. x \n240 yd., which takes four hours. If terrain \nfeatures are to be moved-as compared to \nsimply caving in banks or walls of earth-it \nis necessary that an earth elemental be sub- \nsequently summoned to assist. All spell \ncasting or summoning must be completed \nbefore any effects occur. As any summoned \nearth elemental will perform most of its \nwork underground, it is unlikely that it will \nbe intercepted or interrupted. Should this \noccur, however, the movement of the earth \nrequiring its services must be stopped until \nthe elemental is once again available. \nShould the elemental be slain or dismisd, \nthe move earth spell is limited to collapsing \nbanks or walls of earth.\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 180 | PDF_PAGE 181]\nWizard Spells (6th Level) \nThe spell cannot be used for tunneling, \nand is generally too slow to trap or bury \ncreatures; its primary use is for digging or \nfilling moats or for adjusting terrain con- \ntours before a battle. \nThe material components for this s@ll are \na mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a \nsmall bag and an iron blade. \nNote: This spell does not violently break \nthe surface of the ground. Instead it creates \nwave-like crests and troughs, with the earth \nreacting with glacier-like fluidity until the \ndesired result is achieved. Trees, structures, \nrock formations, and so on, are relatively \nunaffected, save for changes in elevation \nand relative topography. \nWluke’s Freezing Sphere \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: Special \nCodpon$lts V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nOtiluke’s Freezing Sphere is a multi- \npurpose spell of considerable power. If the \ncaster opts, he may create any of the follow- \ning: \nA) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at \nabsolute zero temperature that spreads \nupon contact with water, or a liquid that is \nprincipally water, freezing it to a depth of \nsix inches over an area equal to 100 square \nfeet per level of the mage casting the spell. \nThis ice lasts for one round per level of the \ncaster. \nThe material component is a thin sheet of \ncrystal about an inch square. \nB) Cold ray. The spell can also be used as a \nthin ray of cold that springs from the caster’s \nhand to a distance of 10 yards per level of \nthe wizard; this ray inflicts ld4 +2 points of \ndamage per level of the caster upon the first \ncreature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is \napplicable; all damage is negated if it is suc- \ncessful (as the ray is so narrow a save indi- \ncates it missed). If the first creature is \nmissed, the path of the ray is plotted to its \nfull distance, and anything else in its path \nmust save (if applicable) or suffer appropri- \nate damage. \nThe material component is a white sap- \nphire of not less than 1,OOO gp value. \nC) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe \nabout the size of a sling stone, cool to the \ntouch, but not harmful. This globe can be \nhurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 \nyards (considered short range), or as a sling \nbullet. The globe shatters upon impact, \ninflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon \nall creatures within a 10-foot radius (one- \nhalf damage if a saving throw vs. spell is \nsuccessful). Use the Dungeon Muster’s \nGuide Grenade-Like Missile Table to find \nwhere misses strike. Note that if the globe is \nnot thrown or slung within one round per \nlevel of the spell-caster, it shatters and \ncauses cold damage as stated above. This \ntimed effect can be employed against pursu- \ners, although it can prove hazardous to the \nspellcaster and his associates as well. \nThe material component is a 1,OOO-gp \ndiamond. \nPart Water (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy employing a part water spell, the wiz- \nard is able to cause water or similar liquid to \nmove apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide \ntrough. The depth and length of the trough \nare dependent upon the level of the wizard, \nand a trough three feet deep by 10 yards \nlong is created per level. For example, at \n12th level the wizard would part water 36 \nfeet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long. \nThe trough remains as long as the spell lasts \nor until the wizard who cast it opts to end its \neffects. If cast underwater, this spell creates \nan air cylinder of appropriate length and \ndiameter. If cast directly on a water elemen- \ntal or other water-based creature, the crea- \nture receives 4d8 damage and must roll a \nsuccessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in \npanic for 3d4 rounds. \nThe material components for the spell are \ntwo small sheets of crystal or glass. \nPermanent Illusion @lusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \n.Components: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nan illusion with visual, auditory, olfactory, \nand thermal elements. The spell can create \nthe illusion of any object, creature, or force, \nas long as it is within the boundaries of the \nspell’s area of effect. It affects all creatures \nthat view the illusion, even to the extent of \nthem suffering damage from falling into an \nillusory pit full of sharp spikes. \nCreatures that attempt to disbelieve the \nillusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if \nsuccessful, they see it for what it is and add \n+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect \nare immune until they become aware of it. \nThe permanent illusion is subject to a dispel \nmagic spell, of course. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of fleece. \nProgrammed Illusion \n(IIlusionlPhurterm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ &/led \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a spectral force \nthat activates upon command or when a \nspecific condition occurs. The illusion has \nvisual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal ele- \nments. It can be of any object, mature, or \nforce, as long as it remains within the \nboundaries of the spell’s area of effect. \nThe occurrence that begins the illusion \ncan be as general or as specific and detailed \nas desired, such as the following: “Begin \nonly when a venerable female human carry- \ning a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged \nwithin one foot of this spot.” Such visual \ntriggers can react to a character using the \ndisguise ability. Command rm is five \nyards per level of the wizard, 80 a 12th-level \nmage can command the programmed illu- \nsion to occur at a maximum encounter \nrange of 60 yards. A programmed illusion \ncannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor \naliment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except \nby external garb. If desired, the effect can be \nkeyed to a specific noise or spoken word. \nThe spell lasts until the illusion occurs, thus \nthe spell duration is variable. The illusion \nwill last for a maximum of one round per \nlevel of the spellcaster. \nCreatures that attempt to disbelieve the \nillusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if \nsuccessful, they see it for what it is and add \n+4 bonuses to associates‘ saving throws, if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect \nare immune until they become aware of it. \nThe illusion is subject to a dispel magic \nspell. \nThe material component of the sjd is a \nbit of fleece. \nProject Image \n(Alteration, Rlusion/Phantrsm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard cre \na nonmaterial duplicate of himself, project- \ning it to any spot within spell range.

The image must be \nwithin view of the wizard projecting it at all \ntimes, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell \nis broken. Note that if the wizard is invisible \nat the time the spell is cast, the image is also \ninvisible until the casteis invisibility ends, \nthou& the ww must still be able to see \ntk (by means of a detect invisibility \naremethod) to maintain the spell. \n3\"\" rltt nipad uses dimension door, teleport, \ng&rd#f, or similar spell that breaks his \nb --& d.dbn, the project image spell ends. \n%euracSrl component of this spell is a \n&@ (doll) 6f the wizard. - \n2. \nReincarnqtion (Necromancy) \nRairge:ibuih \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Tie: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Pc!rson touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the wizard can bring back \nto life a person who died no more than one \nday per level of experience of the wizard \nbefore the casting of the spell. The essence \nof the dead person is transferred to another \nbody, possibly one very different from his \nformer body. Reincarnation does not \nrequire any saving throw, system shock, or \nresurrection survival roll. The corpse is \ntouched, and a new incarnation of the per- \nson will appear in the area in Id6 turns. The \nperson reincarnated recalls the majority of \nhis former life and form, but the character \nclass, if any, of the new incarnation might \nbe different indeed. The new incarnation is \ndetermined on the following table. If a play- \ner character race is indicated, the character \nmust be created. \n24-28 Gnome \n55-59 Hobgoblin \n60-73 Human \nNote: Very good or very evil persons will \nnot be reincarnated as creatures whose gem \neral alignment is the opposite. \nThe material components of the spell are \na small drum and a drop of blood. \nRepulsion (Abjuration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/2 levels \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Creatures in a \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto cause all creatures in the path of the area \nof effect to move directly away from his per- \nson. Repulsion occurs at the speed of the \ncreature attempting to move toward the \nspellcaster. The repelled creature continues \nto move away for a complete round even if \nthis takes it beyond spell range. The caster \ncan designate a new direction each round, \nbut use of this power counts as the caster's \nprincipal action in the round. The caster \ncan, of course, choose to do something else \ninstead of using the repulsion attack. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npair of small magnetized iron bars attached \nto two small canine statuettes, one ivory \nand one eboqy. \nlefoot-wide path \nShades (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDukation: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is related to the shadow mon- \nsters and demi-shadow monsters spells. The \nshades spell uses material from the plane of \nShadow to form semi-real illusions of one or \nmore monsters, up to 1 Hit Die per caster \nlevel. All shades created by one spell must \nbe of the same sort, and they have 60% of \nthe hit point total the real creatures would \nhave. Those viewing the shades and failing \ntheir saving throws vs. spell believe the illu- \nsion. \nThe shades perform as the real monsters \nwith respect to Armor Class and attack \nforms. Special attack forms such as petrifi- \ncation or level drain do not actually occur, \nbut a subject who believes the shgdes are \nreal will react appropriately, until the illu- \nsion is countered by a dispel magic spell or \nihe condition is countd by a heal spell. \nnose who roll successful saving throws see \n.he shades as transparent images superim- \n)osed on vague shadowy forms. These are \nhor Class 6 and cause only 60% of the \nrue monsters' normal melee damage. \nStone to Flesh (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe stone to flesh spell turns any sort of \nstone into flesh. If the recipient stone object \nwas formerly living, this spell, restores life \n(and goods), although the survival of the \ncreature is subject to the usual system shock \nsurvival roll. Any formerly living creature, \nregardless of size, can be thus returned to \nflesh. ordinary stone can be turned to flesh \nin a volume of nine cubic feet per leva of \nexperience of the spellcaster. Such flesh is \ninert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life \nforce or magical energy is available (for \nexample, this speli would turn a stone golem \ninto a flesh golem, but an ordinary siatue \nwould become a body). If cast upon stone, \nthe wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy \nmaterial from one to three feet in &meter \nand up to 10 feet long, allowing a pq to \nbe made. \nThe material components are a pinch of \nearth and a drop of blood. \nThe reverse, flesh to srm, turns flesh of \nany sort to stone. All possessions on theper- \nson of the creature likewise turn to stoae. \nThe intended subject of the spell dves a \npaving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If \na statue created by this spell is subjected to \nbreakage or weathering, the being (if ever \nreturned to his original, fleshy state) win \nhave similar damage, deformities, etc. The \nDM may allow such damage to be repaked \nby various high-level clerical spells, such as \nregenerate. \nThe ma'terial components of the spell are \nlime, water, and earth. \n(Alterafion, jn) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 roundllevel \nCasting Tie: 6 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nTenser's transformation is a sight guw- \n:eed to astound any creature not aware of its \n>ewer, for when the wizard casts the 4, \nle undergoes a startling transformation. \nIhe size and strength of the wizard in- \no heroic proportions, so he becomes a for- \nnidable fighting machine; the spell causes- \nhe caster to become a berserk fighter!

The Armor Class of the \nwizard is 4 better than that he possessed pri- \nor to casing the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 \nto 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor \nClass of -10. \nAU attacks are as a fighter of the same \nlevel as the wizard (Le., the wizard uses the \ncombat values normally reserved for fight- \ners). The wizard can use either a dagger or a \nstaff when attacking. A dagger can be used \ntwice per roFd, and each successful attack \ninflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A \nstaff can be used only once per round, but \nwith a +2 bonus to attack and damage \nrolls. The wizard fights in melee in prefer- \nence to all other forms of attack, and con- \ntinues attacking until all opponents are \nslain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or \nthe spell duration expires. \nThe material component for casting this \nspell is a potion of heroism (or superhero- \nism) that the wizard must consume during \nthe course of uttering the spell. \nlkansmute Water to Dust (Alteration) \nRevetsibk \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDurah: Permanent \nCasting Time 5 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None (special) \nWhen this spell is cast, the subject area \ninstantly undergoes a change from liquid to \npowdery dust. Note that if the water is \nalready muddy, the area of effect is doubled, \nwhile if wet mud is being transmuted, the \narea of effect is quadrupled. If water \nremains in contact with the transmuted \ndust, the former quickly soaks the latter, \nturning the dust into silty mud, if a suffi- \ncient quantity of water exists to do so, oth- \nerwise soaking or dampening the dust \naccordingly. \nOnly liquid actually in the area of effect \nat the moment of spellcasting is affected. \nLiquids that are only partially water are \naffected only insofar as the actual water \ncontent is concerned, except that potions \ncontaining water are rendered useless. Liv- \ning creatures are unaffected, except for \nthose native to the elemental plane of Water. \nSuch creatures receive saving throws vs. \nspell. Failure inflicts ld6 points of damage \nper caster level upon the subject, while suc- \ncess means the creature receives but half \ndamage. Only one such creature can be \naffected by any single casting of this spell, \nregardless of the creature's size or the size of \nthe spell's area of effect. \nThe reverse of the spell is simply a very \nhigh-powered create water spell that \nrequires a pinch of normal dust as an add- . \ntional material component. \n1 \n' \nFor either usage of the spell, other compo- \nnents required are diamond dust of at least \n500 gp value and a bit of seashell. \nTrue Seeing (Divination) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: &foot light range \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard employs this spell, he \nconfers upon the recipient the ability to see \nall things as they actually are. The spell pen- \netrates normal and magical darkness. Secret \ndoors become plain. The exact location of \ndisplaced things is obvious. Invisible things \nbecome visible. Illusions and apparitions \nare seen through. Polymorphed, changed, \nor enchanted objects are apparent. (The real \nform appears translucently super-imposed \non the apparent form: a gold dragon poly- \nmorphed to human form would appear \nhuman with a ghostly dragon looming over \nthe human form.) Unlike the clerical version \nof this spell, the recipient cannot determine \nalignment. The recipient can focus his \nvision to see into the Ethereal plane or the \nbordering areas of adjacent planes. The \nrange of vision conferred is 60 feet. True see- \ning does not penetrate solid objects: it in no \nway confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. \nFurthermore, the spell effects cannot be \nenhanced with magic. \nThe spell requires an ointment for the \neyes that is made from a very rare mush- \nroom powder, saffron, and fat. It costs no \nless than 300 gp per use and must be aged for \nld6 months. \nVeil (Illusior~Phantasrn) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Fffect: 20-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThe veil spell enables the d to instantly \nchange the appearance of his surroundhgs \nand party or to atate hallucinatory terrain so \nas to fool even the most dewr creatures unless \nthey have the true seeing spell, a gem of see- \ning, or similar magical aid. The veil m make \na sumptuous room seem a filthy den and even \ntactile impressions conform to the visual illu- \nsion. Likewise, a party might be made to \nresemble a mixed band of brownies, pixies, \nand faeriesled by a treant.

Up to 2 Hit Dice or \nlevels of creature per caster level can be ban- \nished. \nThe caster must both name the type of \ncreature(s) to be sent away and give its \nname and title as well, if any.

For \nevery such substance included in the cast- \ning, the subject creature(s) loses 5 % from its \nmagic resistance and suffers a - 2 penalty to \nits saving throw vs. spell. For example, if \niron, holy waterv sunstone, and a sprig of \nrosemary were used in casting a banishment \nupon a bemg that hates those things, its sav- \ning throw versus the spell would be made\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 183 | PDF_PAGE 184]\nI Wizard Snells (7th Level\\ \nwith a -8 penalty (four substances timer \nthe factor of -2). Special items, such as hair \nfrom the tail of a ki-rin, or couatl feathers, \ncould also be added to bring the factor up to \n-3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a titan’s hair \nor mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower \nthe factor to -1 with respect to the same \ncreature. If the subject creature successfully \nrolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is \nstung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 \npoints of damage, and is stunned for one \nround. \nBigby’s Grasping Hand (Evocation) \n*: 10 yards/level \na-ts: V, S, M \nm: I round/level \nsping hand is a superior ver- \n6th-level Bigby’s forceful hand. It \nman-sized (five feet) to gar- \ngan-ed (21 feet) hand that appears \nand grasps a creature designated by the \ncaster, regardless of what the spellcaster \ndoes or how the opponent tries to escape it. \nThe grasping hand can hold motionless a \ncreature or object of up to 1,ooO pounds \nweight, slow movement to 10 feet per round \nif the creature weighs between 1,OOO and \n4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if \nthe creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds. \nThe hand itself inflicts no damage. The \ngrasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has \nas many hit points as its caster in full health, \nand vanishes when destroyed. The caster \ncan order it to release a trapped opponent or \ncan dismiss it on command. \nThe material component is a leather \nglove. \nChum Plants (EnchantmentKhann) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe charm plants spell enables the spell- \ncaster to bring under command vegetable \nlife forms and communicate with them. \nThese plants obey instructions to the best.of \ntheir ability. The spell will charm plants in a \n30’ x 10’ area. While the spell does not en- \ndow the vegetation with new abilities, it \ndoes enable the wizard to command the \nplants to use whatever they have in order to \nfulfill his instructions; if the plants in the \narea of effect do have special or unusual \nabilities, these are used as commanded by \nthe wizard. For example, this spell can gen- \nerally duplicate the effects of the 1st-level \npriest spell entangle, if the caster desires. \nThe saving throw applies only to intelligent \nplants, and it is made with a -- 4 penal6 to \nthe die roll. \nThe material components of the soell are \na pinch of humu \ntwig or leaf. \nr: and a \nControl Undead (Necromancy) \nRange: 60 feet \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3d4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: ld6 undead \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to command \nld6 undead creatures for a short period of \ntime. Upon casting the spell, the wizard se- \nlects one point within range of the spell. \nThose undead nearest to this point are af- \nfected, until either undead equal in Hit Dice \nto the caster‘s level or six undead are af- \nfected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are \nautomatically controlled. Those of greater \nHit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. \nspell, which if successful negates the attempt \nto control that creature. Regardless of the \nsuccess or failure of the saving throw, each \ncreature required to make a check counts to- \nward the Hit Dice limit of the spell. \nThose creatures under the control of the \nwizard can be commanded by the caster if \nthey are within hearing range. There is no \ntelepathic communication between the \ncaster and the controlled undead. There is \nno language requirement either. Even if \ncommunication is impossible, the con- \ntrolled undead do not attack the spellcaster. \nAt the end of the spell, the controlled un- \ndead revert to their normal behaviors. \nThose not mindless will remember the con- \ntrol exerted by the wizard. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall piece each of bone and raw meat. \nDelayed Blast Fireball (Evocation) \nRange: 100 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nkea of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nThis spell creates a fireball, with a + 1 bo- \nius to each of its dice of damage, which re- \neases its blast anywhere from instantly to \nive rounds later, according to the command \n:iven by the wizard. In &her respects, the \nlpell is the same as the 3rd-level spell fire- \ntall. \nDrawmij’s Instant Summons \n(ConjuratiodSummonhg) \nRange: Infinite + special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 small object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard tele- \nports some desired item from virtually any \nlocation directly to his hand. The single ob- \nject can be no longer in any dimension than \na sword, can have no more weight than a \nshield (about eight pounds), and it must be \nnonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard \nmust hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp \nvalue in his hand and utter all but the final \nword of the conjuration. He then must \ncrush this gem and utter the final word. The \ndesired item is then transported instantly \ninto the spellcaster‘s right or left hand as he \ndesires. The item must have been previously \ntouched during the initial incantation and \nspecificaIly named; only that particular \nitem is summoned by the spell. The special \nIf the item is in the passessi \ncreature, the spell does not \ncaster knows wh \nthe summons is \nmoned from othe \n(not necessarily the physical grasp) of an- \nother creature. For each level of expaience \nabove the 14th, the wizard is able to sum- \nmon a desired item from one plane farther \nremoved from the plane he is in at the time \nthe spell is cast (one plane away at 14th \nlevel, two planes away at 15th. etc.) Thus, a \nwizard Qf 16th level could cast the spell even \nif the desired item was on the second layer of \none of the outer planes, but at 14th level the \nwizard would be able to summon the item \nonly if it were no farther than one of the in- \nner planes, the Ethereal plane, or the AstraI \nplane (see Manual of the Runes). Note that \nspecial wards or barriers, or factors that \nblock the teleport or plane shift spells, may \nalso block the operation of this spell. Ob- \njects in Leomunds secret chest cannot be re- \ncovered by using this spell. \nNote: If the item is wizard marked, it can \nbe summoned from anywhere on the same \nplane unless special local conditions \nFurthermore, the details of the locat \nthe item are more specific, \nmore easily traceable with \nscrying magic. \n183\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 184 | PDF_PAGE 185]\nDuo-Dlmcnslon (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nA duo-dimension spell causes the caster \nto have only two dimensions, height and \nwidth, but no depth. He is thus invisible \nwhen turned sideways. This invisibility can \nbe detected only by means of a true seeing \nspell or similar methods. In addition, the \nduo-dimensional wizard can pass through \nthe thinnest of spaces as long as these have \nthe proper height-going through the space \nbetween a door and its frame is a simple \nmatter. The wizard can perform all actions \nnormally. He can turn and become invisible, \nmove in this state, and appear again next \nround and cast a spell, disappearing on the \nfollowing round. \nNote that when turned, the wizard cannot \nbe affected by my form of attack, but when \nvisible, he is subject to double the amount of \ndamage normal for an attack form, e.g., a \ndagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of \ndamage if it struck a duodimensional wiz- \nard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion \nof his existence in the Astral plane when the \nspell is in effect, and he is subject to possible \nnotice by creatures there. If noticed, it is \n25% probable that the wizard is pulled en- \ntirely into the Astral plane by any attack \nfrom an astral creature. Such an attack (and \nany subsequent attack received on the As- \ntral plane) inflicts normal damage. \nThe material components of this spell are \na flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which \nmust be of finest workmanship, gold fili- \ngreed, and enameled and gem-studded at an \naverage cost of 500 to 1,OOO gp) and a strip \nof parchment. As the spell is uttered, the \nparchment is given a half twist and joined at \nthe ends. The figurine is then passed \nthrough the parchme \nappear forever. \nFinger of Death (Necromancy) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe finger of death spell snuffs out the \nvictim's life force. If successful, the victim \ncan be neither raised nor resurrected. In ad- \ndition, in human subjects the spell initiates \nchanges to the body such that after three \ndays the caster can, by means of a special \nceremony costing not less than 1,OOO gp plus \n500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a ju- \nju zombie under the control of the caster. \nThe changes can be reversed before anima- \ntion by a limited wish or similar spell cast di- \nrectly upon the body, while a full wish \nrestores the subject to life. \nThe caster utters the finger of death spell \nincantation, points his index finger at the \ncreature to be slain, and unless the victim \nsucceeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death \noccurs. A creature successfully saving still \nreceives 2d8 + 1 points of damage. If the \nsubject dies of damage, no internal changes \noccur and the victim can then be revived \nnormally. \nForcecage (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards per 2 levels \nComponents: V, S + special \nDuration: 6 turns + l/level \nCasting Time: 3-4 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nThis powerful spell enables the caster to \nbring into being a cube of force, but it is un- \nlike the magical item of that name in one im- \nportant respect: The forcecage does not \nhave solid walls of force; it has alternating \nbands of force with 1/2-inch gaps between. \nThus, it is truly a cage rather than an en- \nclosed space with solid walls. Creatures \nwithin the area of effect of the spell are \ncaught and contained unless they are able to \npass through the openings-and of course \nall spells and breath weapons can pass \nthrough the gaps in the bars of force of the \nforcecage. \nA creature with magic resistance has a \nsingle attempt to pass through the walls of \nthe cage. If the resistance check is success- \nful, the creature escapes. If it fails, then the \ncreature is caged. Note that a successful \ncheck does not destroy the cage, nor does it \nenable other creatures (save familiars) to \nflee with the escaping creature. The force- \ncage is also unlike the solid-walled protect- \nive device, cube of force, in that it can be \ngotten rid of only by means of a dispel \nmagic spell or by the expiration of the spell. \nBy means of special preparation at the \ntime of memorization, a forcecage spell can \nbe altered to a forcecube spell. The cube cre- \nated is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then re- \nsembles that of a cube of force in all respects \nsave that of the differences between a cast \nspell and the magic of a device, including \nthe methods of defeating its power. \nAlthough the actual casting of either ap- \nplication of the spell requires no material \ncomponent, the study required to commit it \nto memory does demand that the wizard \npowder a diamond of at least 1,OOO gp \nvalue, using the diamond dust to trace the \noutlines of the cage orcube he desires to cre- \nate via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, \nin memorization, the diamond dust is em- \nployed and expended, for upon completion \n184 \n- \nof study, the wizard must then toss the dust \ninto the air and it will disappear. \nLimited Wish (Conjuration/Summoning, \nInvocatiodEvocation) \nRange: Unlimited \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special , \nThe limited wish is a very potent but diffi- \ncult spell. It will fulfill literally, but azdy \npartially or for a limited duration, tb ut&er- \nance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actd@ ad \nthe past, present, or future might be d&e?$d \n(but possibly only for the wizard h th \nwording of the spell is most carefu \nin some limited manner. The use \nwish will not substantially cha \nalities, nor will it bring wealth \nmerely by asking. The spell can, fer rxam- \nple, restore some hit points (or all kh points \nfor a limited duration) lost by the wizard. It \ncan reduce opponent hit probabilities or \ndamage, increase duration of some magical \neffect, cause a creature to be favorably dis- \nposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th \nlevel or less, and so on (see the wish spell). \nGreedy desires usually end in disaster for \nthe wisher. Casting time is based on the time \nspent preparing the wording for the me11 \n(cleveipliyers &de what thTey want tosay \nbefore using the spell). Normally the casting \ntime is one round (most of it being taken up \nby deciding what to say).

If no opponent exists to fight, sum- \n@ aroffsters can, if the wizard can com- \nmunicate ,with them, and if they are \nphyddy capable, perform other services \nfor thc mmoning wizard. \nmaterial components of this spell are \na and a small (not necessarily lit) \n‘% \ncandle.’ \nMordenkainen’s Magnificent \nMansion (Alteration, Conjuration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 7 rounds \nArea of Effect: 300 sq. ft./level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard con- \njures up an extradimensional dwelling, en- \ntrance to which can be gained only at a \nsingle point of space on the plane from \nwhich the spell was cast. From the entry \npoint, those creatures observing the area see \nonly a faint shimmering in the air, in an area \nfour feet wide and eight feet high. The caster \nof the spell controls entry to the mansion, \nand the portal is shut and made invisible be- \nhind him when he enters. He may open it \nagain from his own side at will. Once ob- \nservers have passed beyond the entrance, \nthey behold a magnificent foyer and numer- \nous chambers beyond. The place is fur- \nnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to \nserve a nine-course banquet to as many \ndozens of people as the spellcaster has levels \nof experience. There is a staff of near- \ntransparent servants, liveried and obedient, \nthere to wait upon all who enter. The atmos- \nphere is clean, fresh, and warm. \nSince the place can be entered only \nthrough its special portal, outside condi- \ntions do not affect the mansion, nor do con- \nditions inside it pass to the plane beyond. \nRest and relaxation within the place is nor- \nmal, but the food is not. It seems excellent \nand quite filling as long as one is within the \nplace. Once outside, however, its effects dis- \nappear immediately, and if L-.DS~ resting \nhave not eaten real food within a reasonable \ntime span, ravenous hunger strikes. Failure \nto eat normal food immediately results in \nthe onset of fatigue or starvation penalties \nas decided by the DM. \nThe material components of this spell are \na miniature portal carved from ivory, a \nsmall piece of polished marble, and a tiny \nsilver spoon. These are utterly destroyed \nwhen the spell is cast. \n(It is worth mentioning that this spell has \nbeen used in conjunction with a normal por- \ntal, as well as with illusion magic. There is \nevidence that the design and interior of the \nspace created can be altered to suit the cast- \ner’s wishes.) \nMordenkainen’s Sword (Evocation) \nRange: 30yards . \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard brings \ninto being a shimmering, sword-like plane \nof force. The spellcaster is able to mentally \nwield this weapon (to the exclusion of all ac- \ntivities other than movement), causing it to \nmove and strike as if it were being used by a \nfighter. The basic chance for Mor- \ndenkainen‘s sword to hit is the same as the \nchance for a sword wielded by a fighter of \none-half the level of the spellcaster, e:g., if \ncast by a 14th-level wizard, the weapon has \nthe same hit probability as a sword wielded \nby a 7th-level fighter. The sword has no \nmagical attack bonuses, but it can hit nearly \nany sort of opponent, even those normally \nstruck only by +3 weapons or those astral, \netherea1,or out of phase. It hits any Armor \nClass on a roll of 19 or 20. It infiicts 5d4 \npoints of damage to opponents of man-size \nor smaller, and 5d6 to opponents larger than \nman-sized. It lasts until the spell duration \nexpires, a dispel magic is used successfully \nupon it, or its caster no longer desires it. \nThe material component is a miniature \nplatinum sword with a grip and pommel of \ncopper and zinc, which costs 500 gp to con- \nstruct, and which disappears after the spell’s \ncompletion. \nPhu Door (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: 1 usage/2 levels \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard attunes \nhis body, and a section of wall is affected as \nif by a passwall spell. The phase door is in- \nvisible to all creatures save the spellcaster, \nand only he can use the space or passage the \nspell creates, disappearing when the phase \ndoor is entered, and appearing when it is ex- \nited. If the caster desires, one other creature \nof man size or less can be taken through the \ndoor; this counts as two uses of the door. \nThe door does not pass light, sound, or spell \neffects, nor can the caster see through it \nwithout using it.

The \nreverse gravity lasts as long as the caster \ndesires or until the spell expires. If some \nsolid object is encountered in this \"fall,\" the \nobject strikes it in the same manner as it \nwould during a normal downward fall. At \nthe end of the spell duration, the affected \nobjects and creatures fall downward. As the \nspell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, \nor even thousands of feet in the air above \nthe area can be affected. \nThe material components of this spell are \na lodestone and iron filings. \nsequcst- \n(IllusialdPhantasm, Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 week + 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: &foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen cast, this spell not only prevents \ndetection and location spells from working \nto detect or locate the objects affected by the \nsequester spell, it also renders the affected \nobject(s) invisible to any form of sight or \nseeing. Thus, a sequester spell can mask a \nsecret door, a treasure vault, or whatever. \nOf course, it does not render the subject \nproof from tactile discovery or from \ndevices, such as a robe of eyes or a gem of \nseeing. If cast upon a creature not desiring \nto be affected, a normal saving throw vs. \nspell is given. Living creatures (and even \nundead types) affected by a sequester spell \nbecome comatose and are effectively in a \nstate of suspended animation until the spell \nwears off or is dispelled. \nThe material components of the spell are \na basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram \nof whitewash. \nShadow Walk @lusion, Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 6 turns/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nIn order to use the shadow walk spell, the \nwizard must be in an area of heavy \nshadows. The caster and any creature he \ntouches are then transported to the edge of \nthe Prime Material plane where it borders \nthe plane of Shadow. In this region the wiz- \nard can move at a rate of up to seven miles \nper turn, moving normally on the borders \nof the plane of Shadow but much more rap- \nidly relative to the Prime Material plane. \nThus rapid travel can be accomplished by \nmoving in the plane of Shadow and then \nstepping from the plane of Shadow to the \nPrime Material plane. The wizard knows \nwhere he will come out on the Prime Materi- \nal plane. \nThe shadow walk spell can also be wed to \ntravel to other planes that border on the \nplane of Shadow, but this requires the \npotentially perilous transit of the pkne of \nShadow to arrive at a border with andm \nplane of reality. Any creatures touched by \nthe wizard when shadow walk is cast also \nmake the transition to the borders of the \nplane of Shadow. They may opt to follow \nthe wizard, wander off into Shadowland, or \nstumble back into the Prime Material plane \n(50% chance for either result if \nunwilling to accompany the wiud i#wr tbr \nor abandoned by the wizard). \nplane of Shadow get a saving th. \ning the effect if successful. \n?!!&z!z lr/' \nI' \nSlmulacrum (Illtlsion/phmt.rm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permangt \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto create a duplicate of any creature. The \nduplicate appears to be exactly the same as \nthe original, but there are differences; the \nsimulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50% + \nIdlo%) of the hit points of the real creature, \nthere are personality differences, there are \nareas of knowledge that the duplicate does \nnot have, and a detect magic spell will \ninstantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as wiil a \ntrue seeing spell. At all times the simula- \ncrum remains under the absolute command \nof the wizard who created it. No special tele- \npathic link exists, so command must be \nexercised in some other manner. The spell \ncreates the form of the creature, but it is \nonly a zombie-like creation. A reincarna- \ntion spell must be used to give the duplicate \na vital force, and a limited wish spell must \nbe used to empower the duplicate with 40% \nto 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge \nand personality of the original. The level, if \nany, of the simulacrum is from 20% to 50% \nof that of the original creature. \nThe duplicate creature is formed from ice \nor snow. The spell is cast over the rough \nform ahd some piece of the creature to be \nduplicated must be placed inside the snow \nor ice. Additionally, the spell requires pow- \ndered ruby. \nThe simulacrum has no ability to become \nmorepowerful: it cannot increase its level or \nabilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and \nmelts into nothingness. Damage to the simula- \naum can be repaid by a complex process \nreguiringat least one day, lOOgp per hit point, \nand a fully equipped laboratory. \nE \n186\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 187 | PDF_PAGE 188]\nWizard Spells (7th Level) \n&juration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Up to 3 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis powerful abjuration causes spells \ncat against the wizard to rebound on the \noriginal caster.

Both (and any \ncreatures in the respective areas) can roll \nsaving throws vs. spell for half damage. \nPartially turned hold or pady~k spells will \nslow those who are 50% or more affected. \nIf the protected wizard and a spellcasting \nattacker both have spell turning effects op- \nerating, a resonating field is created that has \nDlOO \nRON Effect \n01-70 \n7l-80 \n81-97 \n98-00 \n- \n1 \nI \nL. \nthe following effects: \nSpell drains away without effect \nSpell affects both equally at full \nBoth turning dfects are rendered \nnon-functional for Id4 turns \nBoth casters go through a rift \ninto the Positive Material plane \nThe material component for the spell is a \ndamage \nsmall silver mirror. \nStatue (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a statue spell is cast, the wizard or \nother creature is apparently turned to solid \nstone, along with any garments and equip- \nment worn or carried. The initial transfor- \nmation from flesh to stone requires one full \nround after the spell is cast. During this ini- \ntial transformation, the creature must roll a \nsaving throw of 82% or less, with -1 de- \nducted from the dice roll for each point of \nConstitution, so an 18 Constitution grants \ncertain success. Failure indicates system \nshock and death. Thereafter the creature \ncan withstand any hpection and appear to \nbe a stone statue, although a faint magic is \ndetected from the stone if it is checked for. \nDespite being in this condition, the petri- \nfied individual can see, hear, and smell nor- \nmally. Feeling is limited to those sensations \nthat can affect the granite-hard substance of \nthe individual’s body-i.e., chipping is \nequal to a slight wound, but breaking off \none of the statue’s arms is serious damage. \nThe individual under the magic of a \nstatue spell can return to his normal state in- \nstantly, act, and then return to the statue \nstate, if he so desires, as long as the spell du- \nration is in effect. \nThe material components of this spell are \nlime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an \niron bar, such as a nail or spike. \nTeleport Without Error (Alteration) \nRange Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is similar to the teleport spell. \nThe caster is able to transpart himself, along \nwith the material weight noted for a teleport \nspell, to any known location in his home \nplane with no chance for error. The spell \nalso enables the caster to travel to other \nplanes of existence, but any such plane is, at \nbest, ”studied carefully.” This assumes that \nthe caster has, in fact, actually been to the \nplane and carefully perused an area for an \neventual teleportution without error spell. \nThe table for the teleport spell is used, with \nthe caster’s knowledge of the area to which \ntransportation is desired used to determine \nchance of error. (Exception: See the 9th- \nlevel wizard spell, succor.) The caster can \ndo nothing else the round that he appears \nfrom a teleport. \nVi.mirh (Aheration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard employs this spell, tw \ncauses an object to vanish (i.e., to be tek- \nported as if by a telsport spell) if it wei+ \nno more than 50 pounds per caster level. \nThus a 14th-level caster can vanish, and \ncause to reappear at a desired location, an. \nobject up to 700 pounds in weight. The max- \nimum volume of material that can be af- \nfected is three cubic feet per level of \nexperience. Thus, both weight and volume \nlimit the spell. An object that exceeds either \nlimitation is unaffected and the spell fa&. \nIf desired, a vanished object can be placed \ndeep within the Ethereal plane. Ln this case, \nthe point from which the object vanished re \nmains faintly magical until the item is re- \ntrieved. A successful dispel magic spell cast \non the point will bring the vanished item \nback from the Ethereal plane. Note that \ncreatures and magical forces cannot be \nmade to vanish. \nThere is a 1 % chance that a vanished item \nwill be disintegrated instead. There is also a \n1 % chance that a creature from the Et- \nplane is able to gain access to the Prime Ma- \nterial plane through the vanished item’s con- \nnection. \nVision (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nAt such time as the wizard wishes to gain \nsupernatural guidance, he cast6 a visiOrr \nspell, calling upon whatever power he ole- \nsires aid from, and askirlg the question far \nwhich a vision is to be given in answer. Two \nsix-sided dite are rolled. If they total 2 to 6, \nthe power is annwed and will cause thewiz- \nard, by an ultra-powerful geas or quest, to \ndo some service, and no questions are an- \nswered. If the dice total 7 to 9, the power is \nindifferent, and some minor vision, posbi- \nbly unrelated to the question, is given. A \nscore of 10 or better indicates that the vision \nis granted. \nThe material component of the spell is thc \nsacrifice of something valued by the spell- \ncaster or by the power supplicated. The \nmore precious the sacrifice, the better the \nchance of spell success. A very precious \nitem grants a bonus of +1 on the dice, one \nthat is extremely precious adds +2, and a \npriceless item adds + 3. \n187\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 188 | PDF_PAGE 189]\nrn \nWizard Spells (8th Level] \nI I \nI N \nI I \nEighth-Level Spells \nAntipath y-S ympath y \n(EnchantmenffCharm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 hours/level \nCasting Time: 1 hour \nArea of Effect: Sdal \nsaving %ow: Special \nt This spell allows the wizard to set certain \nvibrations to emanate from an obiect or \nlocation that tend to either repel or aitract a \nspecific type of intelligent creature or char- \nacters of a particular alignment. The wizard \nmust decide which effect is desired with \nregard to what creature type or alignment \nbefore beginning the spellcasting, for the \ncomponents of each application differ. The \nspell cannot be cast upon living creatures. \nAntiputhy: This spell causes the affected \ncreature or alignment type to feel an over- \npowering urge to leave the area or to not \ntouch the affected item. If a saving throw \nvs. spell is successful, the creature can stay \nin the area or touch the item, but the crea- \nture will feel very uncomfortable, and a per- \nsistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss \nof 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the \nspell's duration), subject to a maximum loss \nof 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. \nFailure to save vs. spell forces the being to \nabandon the area or item, shunning it per- \nmanently and never willingly returning it \nuntil the spell is removed or expires. \nThe material component for this applica- \ntion of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in \nSympathy: By casting the sympathy \napplication of the spell, the wizard can \ncause a particular type of creature or align- \nment of character to feel elated and pleased \nto be in an area or touching or possessing an \n~ vinegar. \nr! ' \nobject or item. The desire to stay in the area \nor touch the object is overpowering. Unless \na saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled \nthe creature or character will stay or refuse \nto release the object. If the saving throw is \nsuccessful, the creature or character is \nreleased from the enchantment, but a subse- \nquent saving throw must be made ld6 turns \nlater. If this saving throw fails, the affected \ncreature will return to the area or object. \nThe material components of this spell are \n1,OOO gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop \nof honey. \nNote that the particular type of creature \nto be affected must be named specifically, \ne.g., red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lam- \nmasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, \nthe specific alignment must be named, e.g., \nchaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, \ntrue neutral, etc. \nIf this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot \ncube can be enchanted per experience level \nof the caster. If an object or item is enchant- \ned, only that single thing can be enchanted; \naffected creatures or characters save vs. the \nspell with a -2 penalty. \nBigby's Ctenched Fist (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe Bigby's clenchedfist spell brings torth \na huge, disembodied hand that is balled into \na fist. This magical member is under the \nmental control of the spellcaster, who can \ncause it to strike one opponent each round. \nNo concentration is required once the spell \nis cast. The clenched fist never misses, but it \ncan only strike as directed by the caster. \nThus it can be fooled by invisibility or other \nmethods of concealment and misdirection. \nThe effectiveness of its blows varies from \nround to round. \nDZO \nRoll Result \n13-16 solid punch-2d6 hp \n17-19 hard punch-3d6 hp and opponent \nis stunned next round \n20 Crushing blow*-4d6 hp and \nopponent is stunned for next three \nrounds \n1-12 glancing blow-ld6 hp \nThe wizard adds +4 to the die rolls of \nsubsequent attacks if the opponent is \nstunned, as the opponent is not capable of \ndodging or defending against the attack \neffectively. \nThe fist has an Armor Class of 0, and is \ndestroyed by damage equal to the hit points \nof its caster at full health. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nleather glove and a small device consisting \nof four rings joined so as to form a slightly \ncurved lie, with an \"I\" upon which the bot- \ntoms of the rings rest, the whole fashioned \nof an alloy of copper and zinc. \nBinding (Enchantment, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nA binding spell creates a magical m#mht \nto hold a creature, usually from e \nplane of existence. Extra- dllrr \nmust be confined bv a CirrrJr \nactually uttered. The compr--kw \naccording to the form of the spel. bmt dwy \ninclude a continuous chanting mce \nread from the scroll or book page giving the \nspell; gestures appropriate to the form of \nbinding; and materials such as miniature \nchains of special metal (silver for lycan- \nthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest \nsort, a corundum or diamond gem of great \nsize (1,OOO gp value per Hit Die of the sub- \nject creature), and a vellum depiction or \ncarved statuette of the subject to be cap \ntured. \nMagic resistance applies unless the sub- \nject's true name is used. A saving throw is \nnot applicable as long as the experience level \nof the caster is at least twice as great as the \nHit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can \nbe augmented by one-third of the levels of \neach assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, \nand by one level for each assistant of 4th \nthrough 8th level. No more than six other \ner's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the \nsubject, then the subject gains a saving \nthrow vs. spell, modified by the form of \nbinding being attempted. The various forms \nof binding are these: \nChaining: The subject is confined by \nrestraints that generate an untipathy affect- \ning all creatures who approach the subject, \nexcept the caster. Duration is as long as one \nyear per level of the caster(s). The subject of \nthis form of binding (as well as in the slum- \nber and bound slumber versions) remains \nwithin the restraining barrier. \nSlumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon \nthe subject for a duration of up to one year \nper level of the caster(s). \nBound Slumber: A combination of chain- \ning and slumber that lasts for up to one \nmonth per level of the caster(s). \nHedged Prison: The subject is transported \nto or otherwise brought within a confined \nwizards can dst with this ell.

The spell remains until \nthe magical hedge is somehow broken. \nMetamorphosis: Causes the subject to \nchange to some noncorporeal form, save for \nits head or face. The binding is permanent \nuntil some prescribed act fr&s the subject. \nMinimus Containment: The subject is \nshrunken to a height of one inch or even less \nand held within the hedged prison of some \ngem or similar object. The subject of a mini- \nmus containment, metamorphosis, or \nhedged prison radiates a very faint aura of \n% type of binding does not modify the \nmvimg thmw for the chaining form of the \n@.

However, if the \ndjkt b magically weakened, the referee \n--a -1, -2,oreven -4penaltyto \nthe saving throw. A successful saving throw \nenables the subject to burst its bonds and do \nas it pleases. \nA binding spell can be renewed in the case \nof the first three forms of the syll, for the \nsubject does not have the opportunity to \nbreak the bonds. (If anything has caused a \nweakening of a chaiiing or slumber version, \nsuch as attempts to contact the subject or \nmagically touch it, a normal saving throw \napplies to the renewal of the spell.) Other- \nwise, after one year, and each year thereaf- \nter, the subject gains a normal saving throw \nvs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the \nbinding spell is broken and the creature is \nfree. \nClone (Necromancy) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Perqanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates a duplicate of a human, \ndemihuman, or humanoid creature. This \ndone is in most respects the duplicate of the \nindividual, complete to the level of experi- \nence, memories, etc. However, the dupli- \ncate really is the person, so that if the \noriginal and a duplicate exist at the same \ntime, each knows of the other’s existence; \nand the original person and the clone will \neach desire to do away with the other, for \nsuch an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If \none cannot destroy the other, one will go \ninsane (90% likely to be the clone) and \ndestroy itself, or possibly (2% chance) both \nwill become mad and destroy themselves. \nThese events nearly always occur within \none week of the dual existence. Note that \nthe clone is the person as he existed at the \ntime at which the flesh was taken, and all \nsubsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is \ntotally unknown to the clone. The clone is a \nphysical duplicate, and possessions of the \noriginal are another matter entirely. A clone \ntakes 2d4 months to grow, and on€y after \nthat time is dual existence established. \nFinally, the clone has one less Constitution \npoint than the body it was cloned from, and \nthe cloning fails if the clone would have a \nConstitution of 0. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall piece of the flesh from the person to be \nduplicated. \nThe DM may, in addition, add other stip- \nulations to the success of a cloning effort, \nrequiring that some trace of life must remain \nin the flesh sample, that some means of stor- \ning and preserving the sample must be \ndevised and maintained, etc. \nDemand \n(Evocation, EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is very much like the 5th-level \nwizard spell sending, allowing a brief con- \ntact with a far distant creature, except that \nthe message can also contain a suggestion \n(see 3rd-level wizard spell), which the sub- \nject will do its best to carry out if it fails its \nsaving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty. \nOf course, if the message is impossible or \nmeaningless according to the circumstances \nthat exist for the subject at the time the \ndemand comes, the message is understood \nbut no saving throw is necessary and the \nsuggestion is ineffective. \nThe caster must be familiar with the crea- \nture contacted and must know its name and \nappearance well. If the creature in question \nis not in the same plane of existence as the \nspellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that \nthe demand does not arrive. Local condi- \ntions on other planes may worsen this \nchance considerably at the option of the \nDM. The demand, if received, will be \nunderstoodeven if the creature has an Intel- \nligence ability score as low as 1 (animal \nIntelligence). Creatures of demigod status \nor higher can choose to come or not, as they \nplease. \nThe demand message to the creature must \nbe 25 words or less, including the sugges- \ntion. The creature can also give a short reply \nimmediately. \nThe material components of the spell are \na pair of cylinders, each open at one end, \nConnected by a thin piece of copper wire and \nsome small part of the subject creature-a \nhair, bit of nail, etc. \nClustecl (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Object touc..ed \nSaving Throw: None \nThe glassteel spell turns normal, non- \nmagical crystal or glass into a transparent \nsubstance that has the tensile strength and \nunbreakability of actual steel. Only a rela- \ntively small volume of material can be \naffected, a maximum weight of 10 pounds \nper level of experience of the spellcaster, and \nit must form one whole object. The Armor \nClass of the substance is 1. \nThe material components of this spell are \na small piece of glass and a small piece of \nsteel. \nIncendiary Cloud \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + ld6 rounds \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: V2 \nAn incendiary cloud spell exactly resem- \nbles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics \nspell, except that its minimum dimensions \nare a cloud of 10-foot height by 20-foot \nlength and breadth. This dense vapor cloud \nbillows forth, and on the third round of its \nexistence it begins to flame, causing 1-2 \npoints of damage per level of the wizard \nwho cast it. On the fourth round it inflicts \nld4 points of damage per level of the caster, \nand on the fifth round this again drops to \n1-2 points of damage per level as its flames \nburn out. Any successive rounds of exist- \nence are simply harmless smoke that \nobscures vision within its confirtes. Cna- \ntures within the cloud need to make only \none saving throw if it is successful, but if \nthey fail the first saving throw, they roll \nagain on the fourth and fifth rounds (if nec- \nessary) to attempt to due damage sus- \ntained by one-half. \nIn order to cast this spell, the wizard must \nhave an available fire source (just as with a \npyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath \na dung pile, and a pinch of dust. \n1 89\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 190 | PDF_PAGE 191]\nWizard Spells (8th level) \nMm Chum (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponent: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA mass charm spell affects either persons \nor monsters just as a charm person spell or a \n&arm monster spell. The mass charm spell, \nhowever, affects a number of creatures \nwhose combined levels of experience or Hit \nDice does not exceed twice the level of expe- \nrience of the spellcaster. All affected crea- \ntures must be within the spell range and \nwithin a 30-foot cube. Note that the crea- \ntures' saving throws are unaffected by the \nnumber of recipients (see the charm person \nand charm monster spells), but all target \ncreatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on \ntheir saving throws because of the efficiency \nand power of this spell. The Wisdom bonus \nagainst charm spells does apply. \nMaze (Conjuratiodiummoning) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nAn extradimensional space is brow.: into \nbeing upon utterance of a maze spell.

This protects \nagainst augury, charm, command, confu- \nsion, divination, empathy (all forms), ESR \nfear feeblemind, mass suggestion, phantas- \nmal killer, possession, rulership, soul trap- \nping, suggestion, and telepathy. Cloaking \nprotection also extends to the prevention of \ndiscovery or information gathering by crys- \ntal balls or other scrying devices, clairaudi- \nence, clairvoyance, communing, contacting \nother planes, or wish-related methods \n(wish, limited wish). Of course, exceedingly \npowerful deities can penetrate the spell's \nbamer. \nMonster Summoning VI \n(ConjuratioiVSurnmoning) \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that it sum- \nmons ld3 6th-level monsters. These appear \nin Id3 rounds within the spell range and at- \ntack the caster's opponents, until either he \ncommands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale, and they \nvanish when slain. If no opponent exists to \nfight, summoned monsters can, if the wiz- \nard can communicate with them, and if they \nare physically capable, perform other serv- \nices for the summoning wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \nOtiluke's Telekinetic Sphere \n(Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: I-footdiameter sphere \nper level \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is exactly the same as the 4th- \nlevel wizard spell, Otiluke's resilient sphere, \nwith the addition that the creatures or ob- \njects inside the globe are just about \nweightless-anything contained within it \nweighs only 1/16 of its normal weight. Any \nsubject weighing up to 5,000 pounds can be \ntelekinetically lifted in the sphere by the \ncaster. Range of control extends to a maxi- \nmum distance of 10 yarddlevel after the \nsphere has actually succeeded in encapsulat- \ning a subject or subjects. Note that even if \nmore than 5,000 pounds of weight is en- \nglobed, the perceived weight is but '/lS of \n. -190 \nactual, so the orb can be rolled without ex- \nceptional effort. Because of the reduced \nweight, rapid motion or falling within the \nfield of the sphere is relatively harmless to \nthe object therein, although it can be disas- \ntrous should the globe disappear when the \nsubject inside is high above a hard surface. \nThe caster can dismiss the effect with a \nword. \nIn addition to a hemispherical piece of di- \namond and a matching piece of gum arabic, \nthe caster must also have a pair of Oyy kr \nmagnets as material compm lor rlJI \nspell. \nOtto's Irresistible Dance \n(EnchantmenUChPnn) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: ld4 + 1 rounds \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched . , \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an OttoS irresistible dance spell is \nplaced upon a creature, the spell causes the \nrecipient to begin dancing, complete with \nfeet shuffling and tapping. This dance \nmakes it impossible for the victim to do any- \nthing other than caper and prance; this ca- \nvorting worsens the Armor Class of the \ncreature by -4, makes saving throws im- \npossible except on a roll of 20, and negates \nany consideration of a shield. Note that the \ncreature must be touched-as if melee com- \nbat were taking place and the spellcaster \nwere striking to do damage. \n,' t \nPermanency (Alteration) \nRange; Special \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell affects the duration of certain \nother spells, making the duration perma- \nnent. The personal spells upon which a per- \nmanency is known to be effective are as \nfollows: \ncomprehend \ndetect evil protection from \ndetect invisibility no& missiles \ndetect magic read magic \ninfrmision , tongues \nprotection from unseen servant \nprotection from evil ~ansuases \ncanttips \nThe wizard casts the desired spell and \nthen follows with the permanency spell. \nEach permanency spell lowers the wizards \nConstitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot \ncast these spells upon other creatures. This \n1 \ni \n1\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 191 | PDF_PAGE 192]\napplication of permanency can be dispelled \nonly by a wizard of greater level than the \nspellcaster was when he cast the spell. \nIn addition to personal use, the perma- \nnency spell can be used to make the follow- \ning object/creature or area-effect spells \npermanent: \nenlarge prismatic sphere \nfear stinking cloud \ngust of wind \ninvisibility wall of force \nmagic mouth web \nwall of fire \nAdditionally, the following spells can be \ncast upon objects or areas only and ren- \ndered permanent: \nalarm wall of fire \naudible glamer distance distortion \ndancing lights teleport \nsolid fog \nThese applications to other spells allow it \nto be cast simultaneously with any of the \nlatter when no living creature is the target, \nbut the entire spell complex then can be dis- \npelled normally, and thus negated. \nThe permanency spell is also used in the \nfabrication of magical items (see the 6th- \nlevel enchant an item spell). At the DMs \noption, permanency might become unstable \nor fail after a long period, at least 1,ooO \nyears. Unstable effects might operate inter- \nmittently or fail altogether. \nThe DM may allow other selected spells \nto be made permanent. Researching this \npossible application of a spell costs as much \ntime and money as independently research- \ning the selected spell. If the DM has already \ndetermined that the application is not possi- \nble, the research automatically fails. Note \nthat the wizard never learns what is possi- \nble, except by the success or failure of his \nresearch. \nPolymorph Any Object (Alteration) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration Variable \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell changes one object or creature \ninto another. When used as a polymorph \nother or stone to flesh spell, simply treat the \nspell as a more powerful version, with sav- \ning throws made with -4 penalties to the \ndie roll. When it is cast in order to change \nother objects, the duration of the spell will \ndepend on how radical a change it is from \nthe original state to its enchanted state, as \nwell as how different it is in size. This will be \ndetermined by your Dungeon Master by \nusing the following guidelines: \nI \nWizard Spells (8th Level) I \nKingdom Animal, vegetable, mineral \nClass Mammals, bipeds, fungi, \nRelationship Twig is to tree, Ad is to \nSize Smaller, equal, larger \nShape Comparative resemblance of \nthe original to the poly- \nmorphed state \nParticularly with regard to a \nchange in which the end \nproduct is more intelligent \nA change in kingdom makes the spell \nwork for hours or turns-i.e., hours if one \nremoved, turns if two removed. Other \nchanges likewise affect spell duration. Thus, \nchanging a lion to an androsphinx would be \npermanent, but turning a turnip to a purple \nworm would be a change of only hours \nduration; turning a tusk into an elephant \nwould be permanent, but turning a twig \ninto a sword would be a change of only sev- \neral turns duration. All polymorphed \nobjects radiate a strong magic, and if a dis- \npel magic spell is successfully cast upon \nthem, they return to their natural form. \nNote that a stone to flesh, or its reverse, will \naffect objects under this spell. As with other \npolymorph spells, damage sustained in the \nnew form can result in the injury or death of \nthe polymorphed creature. It is possible to \n'polymorph a creature into rock and grind it \nto dust, causing damage, perhaps even \ndeath. If the creature was changed to dust to \nstart with, more creative methods to dam- \nage it would have to be applied-perhaps \nusing a gust of wind spell to scatter the dust \nfar and wide. In general, damage occurs \nwhen the new form is altered through physi- \ncal force, although the DM will have to \nadjudicate many of these situations. \nThe system shock roll must be applied to \nliving creatures, as must the restrictions \nnoted regarding the polymorph others and \nstone to flesh spells. Also note that a poly- \nmorph effect often detracts from an item's \nor creature's powers, but does not add new \npowers-except possibly movement capa- \nbilities not present in the old form. Thus, a \nvorpal sword polymorphed into a dagger \nwould not retain vorpal capability.- Like- \nwise, valueless items cannot be made into \npermanent valuable items. \nThe material components of this spell are \nmercury, gum arabic, and smoke. \nmetals, etc. \nbeach, etc. \nIntelligence \nPower Word, Blind \n(ConjurationlSummo \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 15foot-radius sohere \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a vower word. blind svell is car \none or more creatures within he area \neffect become sightless. The spellcaster \nselects one creature as the target center, and \nthe effect spreads oub \naffecting creatures witt \ntotals first; alternatively, the spell can be \nfocused to affect only an individual crea- \nture. Creatures with a current hit point total \nover 100 hit points are not affected and do \nnot count against the number of creatures \naffected. The spell affects up to 100 hit \npoints of creatures, but the durah \ndepends upon how many hit pointr \naffected. If 25 or fewer hit points are d \ned, the blindness is permanent until cured. If \n26 to 50 hit points are affected, the blindness \nlasts for ld4 +1 turns, if 51 to 100 hit points \nof creatures are affected, the spell duration \nis but ld4 + 1 rounds. An individual crea- \nture cannot be partially affected; if all of its \ncurrent hit points are affected, it is blinded, \notherwise, it is not. Blindness can be \nremoved by a cure blindness or dispel magic \nspell. \nPrismatic Wall \n(Conjura tionlSummoning) \nRange: 10 yards I \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nup a vertical, opaque wall-a shimmering, \nmulti-colored plane of light that gives him \nprotection from all forms of attack.

When the spell is \ncast, the wizard dictates what will and will \nnot be observed in the area of effect. The il- \nlusion created must be stated in general \nterms. Thus the caster could specify the illu- \nsion of him and another playing chess for \nthe duration of the spell, but he could not \nhave the illusionary chess players take a \nbreak, make dinner, and then resume their \n;ame. He could have a crossroads appear \nquiet and empty even while an army is actu- \nally passing through the area. He could \nspecify that no one be seen (including pass- \ning strangers), that his troops be unde- \ntected, or even that every fifth man or unit \nshould be visible. Once the conditions are \nset, they cannot be changed. \nAttempts to scry the area automatically \nrt the image stated by the caster with no \nsaving throw allowed. Sight and sound are \nappropriate to the illusion created. A band \nof men standing in a meadow could be con- \ncealed as an empty meadow with birds \nchirping, etc. Direct observation may allow \na saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if \nthere is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Cer- \ntainly onlookers in the area would become \nsuspicious if the column of a marching army \nceI the illusion or necessarily allow a saving \nthrow, assuming care is taken by the hidden \nleings to stay out of the way of those af- \nmted by the illusion. \nhalf \namage \nto stone \nSerten's Spell Immunity (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 round/recipient \nArea of Effect: Creature(s) touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of this spell, the wizard is able to \nconfer virtual immunity to certain spells \nand magical attack forms upon those he \ntouches. For every four levels of experience \nof the wizard, one creature can be pro- \ntected by the Serten's spell immunity spell, \nbut, if more than one is protected, the du- \nration of the protection is divided among \nthe protected creatures. (Example: A 16th- \nlevel wizard can cast the spell upon one \ncreature and it will last 16 turns, or place it \nupon two creatures for eight turns, or upon \nfour creatures for four turns.) The protec- \ntion giGes a bonus to saving throws, ac- \ncording to spell type and level, as shown in \nthe following table. \nSpell level Wizard Spell Priest Spell \n1st-3rd +9* +7 \n4th-6th +7 +5 \n7th-8th +5 +3 \n* Includes beguiling effects. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ndiamond of at least 500 gp value, which \nmust be crushed and sprinkled over the spell \nrecipients. Each such creature must also \nhave m its possession a diamond of at least \none carat size, intact and carried on its per- \nson. \nSink (Enchantment, Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or 1 object of 1 cu- \nbic foot/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, a wizard can force \na creature or object into the very earth or \nfloor upon which it stands. When casting \nthe spell, the wizard must chant the spell for \nthe remainder of the round without inter- \nruption. At that juncture, the subject crea- \nture or object becomes rooted to the spot \nunless a sa4ing throw vs. spell (for a crea- \nture) or a saving throw vs. disintegration \n(for an object with magical properties) is \nsuccessful. (Note: \"magical properties\" in- \nclude those of magical items as listed in the \nDungeon MasterS Guide, those of items en- \nchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and \nthose of items with protection-type spells or \nwith permanent magical properties or simi- \nlar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical \nnature are not entitled to a saving throw. \nThe subject becomes of slightly greater den- \nsity than the surface upon which it stands if \nits saving throw was not successful. \nThe spellcaster now has the option of \nceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it \nis, in which case the spell expires in four \nturns, and the subject returns to normal, If \nthe caster proceeds with the spell (into the \nnext round), the subject begins to sink \nslowly into the ground. Before any actions \nare taken in the new round, the subject sinks \nonequarter of its height; after the fit \ngroup acts, another onequarter; after the \nsecond group acts, another; at the end of the \nround, the victim is totally sunken into the \nground. \nThis entombment places a creature or ob- \nject into a state of suspended animation. \nThe cessation of time means that the subject \ndoes not grow older. Bodily and other func- \ntions virtually cease, but the subject is oth- \nerwise unharmed. The subject exists in \nundamaged form in the surface into which it \nwas sunk, its upper point as far beneath the \nsurface as the subject has height-a six-foot- \ntall victim will be six feet beneath the sur- \nface, while a 60-foot-tall subject will have \nits uppermost point 60 feet below ground \nlevel. If the ground around the subject is \nsomehow removed, the spell is broken and \nthe subject returns to normal, but it does not \nrise up. Such spells as dig, transmute rock to \nmud, and freedom (reverse of the 9th-level \nimprisonment spell) will not harm the \nsunken creature or object and will aften be \nhelpful in recovering it. If a detect magic \nspell is cast over an area upon which a sink \nspell was used, it reveals a faint magical \naura of definable nature, even if the sub- \nject is beyond detection rangk. If the subject \nis within range of the detection, the spell's \nschools can be discovered (alteration and \nenchantment). \n1 92 \n. .. ...\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 193 | PDF_PAGE 194]\nSymbol (ConjuratJon/Summohg) \nRange: Touch \nCbmponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nA symbol spell creates magical runes \nafkcting matures that pass over, touch, or \nread the runes, or pass through a portal \nupon which the symbol is inscribed.

The crea- \nture must be seen by the caster when the \nfinal word is uttered. \nThe spell can be triggered in one of two \nways. First;‘thefinalwordd thespeUcanbe \nspoken when the aeature is within Speu \nrange. This allows magic resbtance (if any) \nand a saving throw va. spell to avoid the \neffea. If the creature’s real name is spoken \nas well, any magic resistance is ignored and \nthe saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty \nof -2. If the saving throw is successful, the \nprison gem shatters. \nThe second method is far more insidious, \nfor it tricks the victim into accepting a trig- \nger object inscribed with the final spell \nword, automatically placing the creature‘s \nsoul into the trap. To use this method, both \nthe creature’s true MIW and the trigger \nword must be inscribed on the trigger item \nwhen the gem is enchanted. A sympathy \nspell can also be placed on the trigger item. \nAs soon as the subject creature picks up or \naccepts the trigger item, its life force is auto- \nmatically transferred to the gem, without \nthe benefit of magic resistance or saving \nthrow. \nThe gem prison will hold the trapped enti- \nty indefinitely, or until the gem is broken \nand the life force is released, allowing the \nmaterial body to reform. If the creature \ntrapped is a powerful creature from another \nplane (and this could actually mean a char- \nacter trapped by some inhabitant of another \nplane of existence when the character is not \non the Prime Material plane), it can be \nrequired to perform a service immediately \nupon being freed. Otherwise the creature \n:an go free onee the gem imprisonhg it is \nwoken. \nBefore the actual casting of the trap the \noul spell, the wizard must prapare the \nnison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for \nvery Hit Die or level of experhce po% \nessed by the creature to be trapped (e.g., it \nquires a gem of 10,000 gp value tb trap a \n0 Hit Die or loth-level creature). If the gem \nE not valuable enough, it shatters when the \nntrapment is attempted. (Note that whih \nharacters have no concept of level as such, \nhe value of the gem needed to trap an id- \nid4 can be researched. Remember that \nhis value can change over time as charac- \ntrs advance.) Creating the prison gem \nequires an enchant an item spell and the \nlacement of a mlue spell into the gem, \niereby forming the prison to contain the \nfe force. \n193\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 194 | PDF_PAGE 195]\nNinth-Level Spells \nAstral Spell (Evocation) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasta Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of the astral spell, a wizard can \nproject his astral body into the Astral plane, \nleaving his physical body and material pos- \nsessions behind in the Prime Material plane \n(the plane in which the entire universe and \nall of its parallels exist). Only magical items \ncan be brought into the! Astral plane \n(although nonmagical items could be ren- \ndered temporarily magical through the use \nof some spells, if the DM allows). As the \nAstral plane touches upon all of the first \nlevels of the outer planes, the wizard can \ntravel astrally to any of these outer planes as \nhe wills. The caster then leaves the Astral \nplane, forming a body in the plane of exist- \nence he has chosen to enter. It is also possi- \nble to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime \nMaterial plane by means of the astral spell, \nbut a second body cannot be formed in the \nPrime Material plane. As a general rule, a \nperson astrally projected can be seen only \nby creatures in the Astral plane. \nAt all times, the astral body is connected \nto the material body by a silvery cord. If the \ncord is broken, the affected person is killed, \nastrally and materially, but normally only \nthe psychic wind can cause the cord to \nbreak. When a second body is formed in a \ndifferent plane, the silvery cord remains \ninvisibly attached to the new body. If the \nastral form is slain, the cord simply returns \nto the original body where it rests in the \nPrime Material plane, reviving it from its \nstate of suspended animation. \nAlthough astrally projected persons are \nable to function in the Astral plane, their \nactions do not affect creatures not existing \nin the Astral plane. The spell lasts until the \nwizard desires to end it, or until it is termi- \nnated by some outside means (a dispel mag- \nic spell or destruction of the wizards body \nin the Prime Material plane). \nThe wizard can project the astral forms of \nup to seven other creatures with him by \nmeans of the astral spell, providing the crea- \ntures are linked in a circle with the wizard. \nThese fellow travelers are dependent upon \nthe wizard and can be stranded. Travel in \nthe Astral plane can be slow or fast accord- \ning to the wizards desire. The ultimate des- \ntination arrived at is subject to the \nconceptualization of the mage. (See the \nManual of the Planes for further informa- \ntion on the Astral plane and astral projec- \ntion.) \nAny magical items can go into the Astral \nplane, but most become temporarily non- \nmagical therein, or in any planes removed \nfrom the Prime Material plane. Armor and \nweapons of +3 or better might function in \nother planes at the DMs option. Artifacts \nand relics function anywhere. Items draw- \ning their power from a given plane are more \npowerful in that plane (e.g., a ring of fire \nresistance in the elemental plane of Fire or a \nsword of life stealing in the Negative Mate- \nrial plane). \nBigby’s Crushing Hand (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe Bigby’s crushing hand spell creates a \nhuge, disembodied hand similar to those of \nthe other Bigby’s hand spells. The crushing \nhand is under the mental control of the cast- \ner, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze \nan opponent. No attack roll is necessary; \nthe hand automatically grasps and inflicts \nconstriction damage any round in which the \nwizard concentrates. The damage inflicted \ndepends on the number of rounds it acts \nupon the victim: \n1st round Id10 hit points \n2nd and 3rd rounds 2d10 hit points \n4th &beyond 4d10 hit points \nThe crushing hand has an Armor Class of \n0, has as many hit points as its caster at full \nstrength, and vanishes when destroyed. The \nhand is susceptible to normal combat \nattacks and damaging spells, but if it is \nstruck by an area-effect spell, the person \nheld suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if \nthe hand fails its saving throw, the victim \nautomatically fails his). The hand is not \neffective against noncorporeal or gaseous \nforms, but it does prevent creatures that are \nable to slip through small cracks from \nescaping. If the hand grasps an item or con- \nstruction, the appropriate saving throw \nmust be made as if squeezed by a Strength of \n25. \nThe material components of the spell are \na glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg. \nCrystalbrittle (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 2 cubic ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe magic of this spell causes metal, \nwhether as soft as gold or as hard as ada- \nmantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as \nbrittle and fragile as crystal. Thus a sword, \n1 04 \ngolem can be changed to a delicate, glass- \nlike material easily shattered by any forceful \nblow. Furthermore, this change is unalter- \nable short of a-wish spell; a dispel magic will \nnot reverse the spell. \nThe caster must physically touch the \nitem-if it is an opponent or something an \nopponent is using or wearing, the wizard \nmust get into melee add roll a successful \nattack roll. Any single metal item can be \naffected by the spell. Thus a suit of armor \nworn by a creature can be changed to crys- \ntal, but the creature’s shield would not be \naffected, or vice versa. All items gain a sav- \ning throw equal to their magical bonus val- \nue or protection (the DM has this \ninformation). A +1/ +3 sword would get a \n10% (average of the two pluses) chance to \nsave; + 5 magical armor has a 25 % chance \nto be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% \nchance to save (for it is hit only by magical \nweapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts \nand relics constructed of metal may be \naffected at the discretion of the DM (this is \nhighly unlikely). Affected items not imme- \ndiately protected are shattered and perma- \nnently destroyed if struck by a normal blow \nfrom a metal tool or any weighty weapon, \nincluding a staff. \nEnergy Drain (Evocation, Necromancy) \nRange: Touch $ \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard opens a \nchannel between the plane he is in and the \nNegative Material plane, the caster becom- \ning the conductor between the two planes. \nAs soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee \nis involved) any living creature, the victim \nloses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A \nmonster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both \nfor hit points and attack ability. A character \nloses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abili- \nties permanently (until regained through \nadventuring, if applicable). \nThe material component of this spell is \nessence of spectre or vampire dust. Prepara- \ntion requires mere moments, then the mate- \nrial component is cast forth, and upon \ntouching the victim, the wizard speaks the \ntriggering word, causing the spell to take \neffect instantly. \nThe spell remains effective for a single \nround only. Humans or humanoids brought \nbelow zero energy levels by this spell can be \nanimated as juju zombies under the control \nof the caster. \nThe caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) \nchance to be affected by the dust, losing one \npoint of Constitution at the same time as the\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 195 | PDF_PAGE 196]\nvictim is drained. When the number of Con- \nstitution points lost equals the caster’s origi- \nnal Constitution ability score, the caster \ndies and becomes a shade. \nForesight (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 roundllevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell grants the caster a powerful \nsixth sense in relation to himself or another. \nAlthough cast upon himself, the wizard can \nspecify that he or another is the beneficiary \nof the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard \nreceives instantaneous warnings of impend- \ning danger or harm to the object of the spell. \nThus, if he were the object of the spell, the \nwizard would be warned in advance if a \nthief were about to attempt to backstab \nhim, or if a creature were about to leap out \nfrom an unexpected direction, or if an \nattacker were specifically targeting him \nwith a spell or missile weapon. When the \nwarnings are about him personally, the wiz- \nard cannot be surprised and always knows \nthe direction from which any attack on him \nis made. In addition, the spell gives the wiz- \nard a general idea of what action he might \ntake to best protect himself- duck, jump \nright, close his eyes, etc.-and gives him a \ndefensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class. \nWhen another is the object of the spell, the \nwizard receives warnings about that person. \nHe must still communicate this to the other \nto negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, \nyanking the person back, even telepathical- \nly communicating through a crystal ball can \nall be accomplished before the trap is \nsprung-if the wizard does not hesitate. The \nobject of the spell does not gain the defen- \nsive bonus to his Armor Class, however. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nhummingbirds feather. \nGate (ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe casting of a gate spell has two effects. \nFirst, it causes an interdimensional connec- \ntion between the plane of existence the wiz- \nard is in and the plane in which dwells a \nspecific being of great power, enabling the \nbeing to merely step through the gate, or \nportal, from its plane to that of the caster. \nSecond, the utterance of the spell attracts \nthe attention of the sought-after dweller in \nthe other plane. When casting the spell, the \n195 \nwizard must name the entity he desires to \nuse the gate and to come to the wizards aid. \nThere is a 100% certainty that something \nsteps through the gate. Unless the DM has \nsome facts prepared regarding the minions \nserving the being called forth by the gate \nspell, the being itself comes. \nIf the matter is trifling, the being might \nleave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the \nwizard, or attack the wizard; if the matter is \nof middling importance, the being can take \nsome positive action to set matters aright, \nthen demand appropriate repayment; and if \nthe matter is urgent, it can act accordingly \nand ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if \nappropriate. The actions of the being that \ncomes through depend on many factors, \nincluding the alignments of the wizard and \nthe deity, the nature of his companions, and \nwho or what opposes or threatens the wiz- \nard. Such beings generally avoid direct con- \nflict with their equals or betters. The being \ngated in will either return immediately (very \nunlikely) or remain to take action. Casting \nthis spell ages the wizard five years. \nImprisonment (Abjuration) \nRevemible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an imprisonment spell is cast and \nthe victim is touched, the recipient is \nentombed in a state of suspended animation \n(see the temporal stusis spell) in a small \nsphere far beneath the surface of the earth. \nThe victim remains there unless a reverse of \nthe spell, with the creature‘s name and back- \nground, is cast. Magical search by crystal \nball, a locate object spell, or similar means \nwill not reveal the fact that a creature is \nimprisoned. The imprisonment spell func- \ntions only if the subject creature’s name and \nbackground are known. \nThe reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the \nspot at which a creature was entombed and \nsunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at \nthat spot. If the caster does not perfectly \nintone the name and background of the \ncreature to be freed, there is a 10% chance \nthat 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from \nimprisonment at the same time. \nNote: The exact details of any creatures \nfreed are up to the DM. A random method \nof determining this is to roll percentile dice \ntwice (once for imprisoned creature density \nand once for a base number of creatures at \nmaximum density). The rolls are multiplied \nand rounded to the nearest whole number. \nEach released creature has a 10% chance to \nbe in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters \nare being generated randomly, roll Id20 for \nlevel, with rolls of 9 + considered 9, and the \nexact monsters determined by the random \nencounter tables. \nFor example, if the \nand 60, the number of \n.22 X .60 = .1320 = \nonly 10% of these will \nvicinity of the caster, \nencounter only one or two \nMeteor Swum (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/le \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/~ \nfrom the outstretched hand of \nthat there are overlapping areas of effect, \nthe outer sides 20 feet long.

That is, spells \nbeing cast are separated into their individual \ncomponents (usually spoiling the effect as a \ndispel magic spell does), and permanent and \nenchanted items must save (vs. spell if actu- \nally cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic \nspell otherwise) or be turned into normal \nitems. Even artifacts and relics are subject to \nMordenkainen's disjunction, although there \nis only a 1% chance per caster experience \nlevel of actually affecting such powerful \nitems. Thus all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, \nmiscellaneous magical items, artifacts and \nrelics, arms and armor, swords, and miscella- \nneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcast- \ner can possibly lose all their magical \nproperties when the Mordenkainen's disjunc- \ntion spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% \nchance per level of destroying an anti-magic \nshell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no \nitems withjn it are disjoined. \nNote: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous \nbusiness, and 95% likely to attract the \nattention of some powerful being who has \nan interest or connection with the device. \nAdditionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the \ncasting wizard must roll a successful saving \nthrow vs. spell with a -4 penalty or perma- \nnently lose all spellcasting abilities. \nWhen this spell is cast, all magic and magi- \nPower Word, Kill \n(Conjumtiodummoning) \nRange: 5 yarddtwo levels \nComponents: V \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: IGfoot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a power word, kill spell is uttered, \none or more creatures of any type within the \nspell range and area of effect are slain. The \npower word slays one creature with up to 60 \nhit paints, or it kills two or more creatures \nwith 10 or fewer hit points, up to a maxi- \nmum of 120 hit points. The option to attack \na single creature, or multiple creatures, \nmust be stated along with the spell range \nand area of effect center. The current hit \npoints of the creatures are used. \nPrismatlc Sphere \n(Abjuration, Conjuratiodummoning) \n,Range: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: 1 tum/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 10-footuadius sphere \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to conjure \nup an immobile, opaque globe of shimmer- \ning, multi-colored light to surround him, \ngiving protection from all forms of attack. \nThis scintillating sphere flashes in all colors \nof the visible spectrum. Seven of the colors \nhave distinct powers and purposes. Any \ncreature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blind- \ned for 2d4 turns by the colors of the sphere. \nOnly the spellcaster can pass in and out of \nthe prismatic sphere without harm, \nalthough he can cast it over others to protect \nthem. The sphere can be destroyed, color by \ncolor, in consecutive order, by various mag- \nical effects; however, the first must be \nbrought down before the second CPR be \naffected, etc. Any creature passing through \nthe barrier receives the effect of every color \nstill remaining. Note that typically the \nupper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as \nthe spellcaster is at the mter of the sphere, \nso the lower half is usually hidden by the \nfloor surface he is standing upon. The colors \nand effects of the prismatic spk, as well \nas what will negate each globe, are shown \non the accompanying table. \nNote that a rod of cancellation or a Mor- \ndenkainen's disjunction spell will destroy a \nprismatic sphere (but an anti-magic shell \nwill fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, any- \nthing short of an artifact or relic entering the \nsphere is destroyed, and any creature is sub- \nject to the effects of every color still active- \ni.e., 70-140 points of damage ph~s death, \npetrification, insanity, and instantaneous \ntransportation to another plane. \nColor of Order \nGlobe of GlobeEffects of Globe \nRed 1st Stops nonmagical missiles-inflicts 20 points of \ndamage, save vs. spell for half \nOrange 2nd Stops magical missiles-inflicts 40 points of dam- \nage, save vs. spell for half \nYellow 3rd Stops poisons, gases, and petrification-inflicts \n80 points of damage, save vs. spell for half \nGreen 4th Stops breath weapons-save vs. poison or dead, \nsuccessful save takes 20 points of poison damage \nBlue 5th Stops location/detection and mental attacks- \nsave vs. petrification or turned to stone \nIndigo 6th Stops magical spells-save vs. wand or insane \nViolet 7th Force field protection-save vs. spell or sent to \nanother plane \nSpell Negated By \ncone of cold \ngust of wind \ndisintegrate \npasiwall \nmagic missile \ncontinual light \ndispel magic \nShape Change (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, a wizard is able to assume \nthe form of any living thing or creature \nbelow demigod status (greater or lesser dei- \nty, singular dragon type, or the like). The \nspellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, \nand has all of the abilities save those depen- \ndent upon Intelligence, innate magical abili- \nties, and magic resistance, for the mind of \nthe creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus \nhe can change into a griffon and fly away, \nthen to an efreet and fly through a roaring \nflame, and then to a titan to lift up a wagon, \netc. These creatures have whatever hit \npoints the wizard has at the time of the \nshape change. Each alteration in form \nrequires but a second. No system shock is \n1% \nincurred. \nExample: A wizard is in combat and \nassumes the form of a will 0' wisp, and when \nthjs form is no longer useful, the wizard \nchanges into a stone golem and walks away. \nWhen pursued, the golemahape is changed \nto that of a flea, which hides upon a horie \nuntil it can hop off and become a bush. If \ndetected as the latter, the wizard can become \na dragon, an ant, or just about anything he \nis familiar with. \nA wizard adopting another form also \nadops its vulnerabilities. For example, a \nwizard who becomes a spectre is powerless \nin daylight, and is subject to beiig turned, \ncontrolled, or destroyed by opposing cler- \nics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is \nkilled in another form does not revert to his \noriginal shape, which may disallow certain \ntypes of revivification. \nThe material component is a jade circlet \nworth no less than 5,OOO gp, which shatters \nat the end of the spell's duration. In the \nmeantime, the circlet is left in the wake of\n\n[BOOK_PAGE 197 | PDF_PAGE 198]\nthe shape change, and premature shatteriq \nends the spell immediately. \nSuccor (Alteration, Enchantment) \nRevemible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 to 4 days \nArea of Effect: 1 individual \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard creates 6 \npowerful magic in some specially prepared \nobject-a statuette, a jeweled rod, a gem, \netc. This object radiates magic, for it con- \ntains the power to instantaneously trans- \nport its possessor to the abode of the wizard \nwho created it. Once the item is enchanted, \nthe wizard must give it willingly to an indi- \nvidual, at the same time informing him of a \ncommand word to be spoken when the item \nis to be used. To make use of the item, the \nrecipient must speak the command word at \nthe same time that he rends or breaks the \nitem. When this is done, the individual and \nall that he is wearing and carrying are \ninstantly transported to the abode of the \nwizard. No other creatures can be affected. \nThe reversed application of the spell \ntransports the wizard to the immediate \nvicinity of the possessor of the spelled item, \nwhen it is broken and the command word \nsaid. The wizard will have a general idea of \nthe location and situation of the item pos- \nsessor, but has no choice whether or not to \ngo (making this a rare casting indeed! ) . \n?he material components used include \ngemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp \nvalue; whether it is a faceted gem or not is \nimmaterial. The components can be \nenchanted only once per month (usually on \na night of a clear, full moon). At that \ntime,the object is set for the type of succor \nand its final destination (either the location \nof the spellcasting or an area well known to \nthe wizard). \nTemporal Stasis (Alteration) \nRwemible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: One creature \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard places \nthe recipient creature into a state of sus- \npended animation. This cessation of time \nmeans that the creature does not grow older. \nIts body functions virtually cease. This state \npersists until the magic is removed by a dis- \npel magic spell or the reverse of the spell \nltemporul reinstatement) is uttered. Note \nthat the reverse requires only a single worc \nand no somatic or material components. \nThe material component of a temporu \nstasis spell is a powder composed of dia. \nmond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, \neach crushed stone of at least 100 gp value \nTime Stop (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting a time stop spell, the wizard \ncauses the flow of time to stop for one round \nin the area of effect. Outside this area the \nsphere simply seems to shimmer for an \ninstant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free \nto act for ld3 rounds of apparent time. The \nwizard can move and act freely within the \narea where time is stopped, but all other \ncreatures, except for those of demigod and \ngreater status or unique creatures, are fro- \nzen in their actions, for they are literally \nbetween ticks of the time clock. (The spell \nduration is subjective to the caster.) Notlung \ncan enter the area of effect without being \nstopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the \narea, the spell is immediately negated. \nWhen the spell duration ceases, the wizard \nis again operating in normal time. \nNote: It is recommended that the DM use \na stop watch or silently count to time this \nspell. If the caster is unable to complete the \nintended action before the spell duration \nexpires, he will probably be caught in an \nembarrassing situation. The use of a tele- \nuort spell before the expiration of the time \nitop spell is permissible. \nWeird WusionlPhantasrn) \nRange: 30 yards \nZomponents: V, S \nhration: Concentration \nZasting Time: 9 \nkea of Effect: 2Gfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell confronts those affected by it \nvith phantasmal images of their most feared \naemies, forcing an imaginary combat that \nems real, but actually occurs in the blink \npf an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard \nnust be able to converse with the victim to \niring the spell into being. During the cast- \nng, the wizard must call out to the creatures \nD be affected, informing one or all that their \ninal fate, indeed their doom, is now upon \nhem. \nThe force of the magic is such that even if \nle creatures make their saving throws vs. \nwll, fear will paralyze them for a full \nround, and they will lose ld4 Strength \npoints from this fear (the lost Strength will \nreturn in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell \ncauses the creature or creatures to face their \nnemeses, the opponents most feared and \ninimical to them. Actual combat must then \ntake place, for no magical means of escape is \npossible. The foe fought is real for all intents \nand purposes. Affected creatures that lose, \ndie. If a creature’s phantasmal nemesis from \nthe weird spell is slain, then the creature \nemerges with no damage, no loss of items \nseemingly used in the combat, and no loss of \nspells likewise seemingly expended. Ejcperi- \nence for defeating the weird is gained if \napplicable. Although each round of combat \nseems normal, it takes but 1/10 of a round. \nDuring the course of the spell, the caster \nmust concentrate fully upon maintaining it. \nIf the combat goes beyond ten rounds, thaw \nwho saved against the spell can take action. \nIf the caster is disturbed, the weird spdl \nends immediately. Creatures attacked while \nparalyzed with fear are free of the paralysis \nimmediately. \nWish (ConjurationSummonjng) \nRange: Unlimited \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe wish speN is a more potent version a \na limited wish. If it is used to alter nrlity \nwith respect to damage sustained by a party, \nto bring a dead creature to lik, or to escape \nfrom a difficult situation by lifting the spell- \ncaster (and his party) from one place to \nanother, it will not cause the wizard any die \nability. Other forms of wishes, however, \ncause the spellcaskr to weaken (-3 on \nStrength) and require a days of bed rest \ndue to the stresse6 the wish places upan \ntime, space, and his body. Regarb of \nwhat is wished for, the exact terminology of \nthe wish spell is likely to be carried out. \nCasting a wish spell ages the caster five \nyears. \nThis discretionary power of the DM js \nnecessary in order to maintain &arm bd- \nmce. As wishing another c~hllc dead \nwould be grossly unfair, for example, yoon \nDM might well advance the spelkpsta to a \n:uture period in which the creature is no \nonger alive, effectively putting the wishing \n:haracter out of the campainn. \n/"
