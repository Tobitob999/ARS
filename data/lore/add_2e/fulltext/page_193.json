A \nprismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a \nspace occupied by a creature is disrupted \nand the spell is wasted. \nScreen (Divinatiodlllusion) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \n,mation: 1 hour/level \nIasting Time: 1 turn \nirea of Effect: Wfoot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell combines several elements to \ncreate a powerful protection from scrying \nand direct observation. When the spell is \ncast, the wizard dictates what will and will \nnot be observed in the area of effect. The il- \nlusion created must be stated in general \nterms. Thus the caster could specify the illu- \nsion of him and another playing chess for \nthe duration of the spell, but he could not \nhave the illusionary chess players take a \nbreak, make dinner, and then resume their \n;ame. He could have a crossroads appear \nquiet and empty even while an army is actu- \nally passing through the area. He could \nspecify that no one be seen (including pass- \ning strangers), that his troops be unde- \ntected, or even that every fifth man or unit \nshould be visible. Once the conditions are \nset, they cannot be changed. \nAttempts to scry the area automatically \nrt the image stated by the caster with no \nsaving throw allowed. Sight and sound are \nappropriate to the illusion created. A band \nof men standing in a meadow could be con- \ncealed as an empty meadow with birds \nchirping, etc. Direct observation may allow \na saving throw (as per a normal illusion), if \nthere is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Cer- \ntainly onlookers in the area would become \nsuspicious if the column of a marching army \nceI the illusion or necessarily allow a saving \nthrow, assuming care is taken by the hidden \nleings to stay out of the way of those af- \nmted by the illusion. \nhalf \namage \nto stone \nSerten's Spell Immunity (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 round/recipient \nArea of Effect: Creature(s) touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of this spell, the wizard is able to \nconfer virtual immunity to certain spells \nand magical attack forms upon those he \ntouches. For every four levels of experience \nof the wizard, one creature can be pro- \ntected by the Serten's spell immunity spell, \nbut, if more than one is protected, the du- \nration of the protection is divided among \nthe protected creatures. (Example: A 16th- \nlevel wizard can cast the spell upon one \ncreature and it will last 16 turns, or place it \nupon two creatures for eight turns, or upon \nfour creatures for four turns.) The protec- \ntion giGes a bonus to saving throws, ac- \ncording to spell type and level, as shown in \nthe following table. \nSpell level Wizard Spell Priest Spell \n1st-3rd +9* +7 \n4th-6th +7 +5 \n7th-8th +5 +3 \n* Includes beguiling effects. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ndiamond of at least 500 gp value, which \nmust be crushed and sprinkled over the spell \nrecipients. Each such creature must also \nhave m its possession a diamond of at least \none carat size, intact and carried on its per- \nson. \nSink (Enchantment, Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or 1 object of 1 cu- \nbic foot/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, a wizard can force \na creature or object into the very earth or \nfloor upon which it stands. When casting \nthe spell, the wizard must chant the spell for \nthe remainder of the round without inter- \nruption. At that juncture, the subject crea- \nture or object becomes rooted to the spot \nunless a sa4ing throw vs. spell (for a crea- \nture) or a saving throw vs. disintegration \n(for an object with magical properties) is \nsuccessful. (Note: \"magical properties\" in- \nclude those of magical items as listed in the \nDungeon MasterS Guide, those of items en- \nchanted or otherwise of magical origin, and \nthose of items with protection-type spells or \nwith permanent magical properties or simi- \nlar spells upon them.) Items of a nonmagical \nnature are not entitled to a saving throw. \nThe subject becomes of slightly greater den- \nsity than the surface upon which it stands if \nits saving throw was not successful. \nThe spellcaster now has the option of \nceasing his spell and leaving the subject as it \nis, in which case the spell expires in four \nturns, and the subject returns to normal, If \nthe caster proceeds with the spell (into the \nnext round), the subject begins to sink \nslowly into the ground. Before any actions \nare taken in the new round, the subject sinks \nonequarter of its height; after the fit \ngroup acts, another onequarter; after the \nsecond group acts, another; at the end of the \nround, the victim is totally sunken into the \nground. \nThis entombment places a creature or ob- \nject into a state of suspended animation. \nThe cessation of time means that the subject \ndoes not grow older. Bodily and other func- \ntions virtually cease, but the subject is oth- \nerwise unharmed. The subject exists in \nundamaged form in the surface into which it \nwas sunk, its upper point as far beneath the \nsurface as the subject has height-a six-foot- \ntall victim will be six feet beneath the sur- \nface, while a 60-foot-tall subject will have \nits uppermost point 60 feet below ground \nlevel. If the ground around the subject is \nsomehow removed, the spell is broken and \nthe subject returns to normal, but it does not \nrise up. Such spells as dig, transmute rock to \nmud, and freedom (reverse of the 9th-level \nimprisonment spell) will not harm the \nsunken creature or object and will aften be \nhelpful in recovering it. If a detect magic \nspell is cast over an area upon which a sink \nspell was used, it reveals a faint magical \naura of definable nature, even if the sub- \nject is beyond detection rangk. If the subject \nis within range of the detection, the spell's \nschools can be discovered (alteration and \nenchantment). \n1 92 \n. .. ..."
