That is, spells \nbeing cast are separated into their individual \ncomponents (usually spoiling the effect as a \ndispel magic spell does), and permanent and \nenchanted items must save (vs. spell if actu- \nally cast on a creature, or vs. a dispel magic \nspell otherwise) or be turned into normal \nitems. Even artifacts and relics are subject to \nMordenkainen's disjunction, although there \nis only a 1% chance per caster experience \nlevel of actually affecting such powerful \nitems. Thus all potions, scrolls, rings, rods, \nmiscellaneous magical items, artifacts and \nrelics, arms and armor, swords, and miscella- \nneous weapons within 30 feet of the spellcast- \ner can possibly lose all their magical \nproperties when the Mordenkainen's disjunc- \ntion spell is cast. The caster also has a 1% \nchance per level of destroying an anti-magic \nshell. If the shell survives the disjunction, no \nitems withjn it are disjoined. \nNote: Destroying artifacts is a dangerous \nbusiness, and 95% likely to attract the \nattention of some powerful being who has \nan interest or connection with the device. \nAdditionally, if an artifact is destroyed, the \ncasting wizard must roll a successful saving \nthrow vs. spell with a -4 penalty or perma- \nnently lose all spellcasting abilities. \nWhen this spell is cast, all magic and magi- \nPower Word, Kill \n(Conjumtiodummoning) \nRange: 5 yarddtwo levels \nComponents: V \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: IGfoot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a power word, kill spell is uttered, \none or more creatures of any type within the \nspell range and area of effect are slain. The \npower word slays one creature with up to 60 \nhit paints, or it kills two or more creatures \nwith 10 or fewer hit points, up to a maxi- \nmum of 120 hit points. The option to attack \na single creature, or multiple creatures, \nmust be stated along with the spell range \nand area of effect center. The current hit \npoints of the creatures are used. \nPrismatlc Sphere \n(Abjuration, Conjuratiodummoning) \n,Range: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: 1 tum/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 10-footuadius sphere \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to conjure \nup an immobile, opaque globe of shimmer- \ning, multi-colored light to surround him, \ngiving protection from all forms of attack. \nThis scintillating sphere flashes in all colors \nof the visible spectrum. Seven of the colors \nhave distinct powers and purposes. Any \ncreature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice is blind- \ned for 2d4 turns by the colors of the sphere. \nOnly the spellcaster can pass in and out of \nthe prismatic sphere without harm, \nalthough he can cast it over others to protect \nthem. The sphere can be destroyed, color by \ncolor, in consecutive order, by various mag- \nical effects; however, the first must be \nbrought down before the second CPR be \naffected, etc. Any creature passing through \nthe barrier receives the effect of every color \nstill remaining. Note that typically the \nupper hemisphere of the globe is visible, as \nthe spellcaster is at the mter of the sphere, \nso the lower half is usually hidden by the \nfloor surface he is standing upon. The colors \nand effects of the prismatic spk, as well \nas what will negate each globe, are shown \non the accompanying table. \nNote that a rod of cancellation or a Mor- \ndenkainen's disjunction spell will destroy a \nprismatic sphere (but an anti-magic shell \nwill fail to penetrate it). Otherwise, any- \nthing short of an artifact or relic entering the \nsphere is destroyed, and any creature is sub- \nject to the effects of every color still active- \ni.e., 70-140 points of damage ph~s death, \npetrification, insanity, and instantaneous \ntransportation to another plane. \nColor of Order \nGlobe of GlobeEffects of Globe \nRed 1st Stops nonmagical missiles-inflicts 20 points of \ndamage, save vs. spell for half \nOrange 2nd Stops magical missiles-inflicts 40 points of dam- \nage, save vs. spell for half \nYellow 3rd Stops poisons, gases, and petrification-inflicts \n80 points of damage, save vs. spell for half \nGreen 4th Stops breath weapons-save vs. poison or dead, \nsuccessful save takes 20 points of poison damage \nBlue 5th Stops location/detection and mental attacks- \nsave vs. petrification or turned to stone \nIndigo 6th Stops magical spells-save vs. wand or insane \nViolet 7th Force field protection-save vs. spell or sent to \nanother plane \nSpell Negated By \ncone of cold \ngust of wind \ndisintegrate \npasiwall \nmagic missile \ncontinual light \ndispel magic \nShape Change (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, a wizard is able to assume \nthe form of any living thing or creature \nbelow demigod status (greater or lesser dei- \nty, singular dragon type, or the like). The \nspellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, \nand has all of the abilities save those depen- \ndent upon Intelligence, innate magical abili- \nties, and magic resistance, for the mind of \nthe creature is that of the spellcaster. Thus \nhe can change into a griffon and fly away, \nthen to an efreet and fly through a roaring \nflame, and then to a titan to lift up a wagon, \netc. These creatures have whatever hit \npoints the wizard has at the time of the \nshape change. Each alteration in form \nrequires but a second. No system shock is \n1% \nincurred. \nExample: A wizard is in combat and \nassumes the form of a will 0' wisp, and when \nthjs form is no longer useful, the wizard \nchanges into a stone golem and walks away. \nWhen pursued, the golemahape is changed \nto that of a flea, which hides upon a horie \nuntil it can hop off and become a bush. If \ndetected as the latter, the wizard can become \na dragon, an ant, or just about anything he \nis familiar with. \nA wizard adopting another form also \nadops its vulnerabilities. For example, a \nwizard who becomes a spectre is powerless \nin daylight, and is subject to beiig turned, \ncontrolled, or destroyed by opposing cler- \nics. Unlike similar spells, a wizard who is \nkilled in another form does not revert to his \noriginal shape, which may disallow certain \ntypes of revivification. \nThe material component is a jade circlet \nworth no less than 5,OOO gp, which shatters \nat the end of the spell's duration.
