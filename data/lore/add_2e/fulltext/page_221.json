    "text": "*I!- Priest Spells (4th Level) \n,- \nscrying can extend only to those planes of \nexistence that are coexistent with or bordeI \non the Prime Material plane-the inner \nplanes (including the para-elemental planes, \nplane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on \nscrying, detection by the subject, and penal- \nties for attempting to scry beyond the cast- \ner's own plane are given in the DMG, as well \nas a description of the crystal bull item. \nThe following spells can be cast through a \nreflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance \nfor operating correctly: detect magic, detect \nsnares and pits, detect poison. Each addi- \ntional detection attempt requires a round of \nconcentration, regardless of success. Infra- \nvision, if available, operates normally \nthrough the reflecting pool. \nThe image is nearly always hazy enough \nto prevent 'ihe reading of scipt of ky ty&. \nThe material compqnent is the oil extract- \ned from such nuts as the hickory and the \nwalnut, refined, and dropped in three mea- \nsures upon the surface of the pool. (A mea- \nsure need be no more than a single ounce of \noil .) \nAt the DMs option, the casting of this \nspell may be limited to once per day. \nRepel Insects (Abjuration, Alteration) \nSphere: Animal, Protection \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the priest creates \nan invisible barrier to all sorts of insects, \nand normal insects do not approach within \n10 feet of the caster while the spell is in \neffect. Giant insects with Hit Dice less than \n1/3 of the caster's experience level are also \nrepelled (e.g., 2 Hit Dice for 7th- to 9th-level \ncasters, 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th \nlevel, etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can \nenter the protected area if the insect is espe- \ncially aggressive and, in addition, rolls a \nsuccessful saving throw vs. spell. Those that \ndo sustain ld6 points of damage from pass- \ning of the magical barrier. Note that the \nspell does not in any way affect arachnids, \nmyriapods, and similar creatures-it affects \nonly true insects. \nThe material components of the repel \ninsects spell include any one of the follow- \ning: several crushed marigold flowers, a \nwhole crushed leek, seven crushed stinging \nnettle leaves, or a small lump of resin from a \ncamphor tree. \nSpeak With Plants (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: do-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen cast, a speak with plants spell \nenables the priest to converse, in very rudi- \nmentary terms, with all sorts of living vege- \ntables (including fungi, molds, and \nplant-like monsters, such as shambling \nmounds) and to exercise limited control \nover normal plants (i.e., not monsters or \nplant-like creatures). Thus, the caster can \nquestion plants as to whether or not crea- \ntures have passed through them, cause \nthickets to part to enable easy passage, \nrequire vines to entangle pursuers, and com- \nmand similar services. The spell does not \nenable plants to uproot themselves and \nmove about, but any movements within the \nplants' normal capabilities are possible. \nCreatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of \nthat name can be released. The power of the \nspell lasts for one round for each experience \nlevel of the casting priest. All vegetation \nwithin the area of effect is affected by the \nspell. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of water, a pinch of dung, and a \nflame. \nSpell Immunity (Abjuration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the priest renders a \ncreature touched immune to the effects of a \nspecified spell of 4th level or lower. It pro- \ntects against spells, spell-like effects of magi- \ncal items, and innate spell-like abilities of \ncreatures. It does not protect against breath \nweapons or gaze attacks of any type. The \nspell has additional limitations. First, the \ncaster must have directly experienced the \neffect of the spell specified. For example, if \nthe caster has been attacked by a fireball \nspell at some time, then he can use spell \nimmunity to provide protection from a fire- \nball. Second, the spell cannot affect a ma- \nture already magically protected by a \npotion, protective spell, ring, or other \ndevice. Third, only a particular spell can be \nprotected against, not a certain sphere of \nspells or a group of spells that are similar in \neffect; thus, a creature given immunity to \nthe lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a \nshocking grusp spell. \n220 \nThe material component for spell immu- \nnity is the same as that for the spell to be \nprotected against. \nSticks to Snakes (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuratioh: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: ld4 sticks + 1 stxk/~evd in a \nlo-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster can \nchange ld4 sticks, plus one stick per ex@- \nence level, into snakes; thus a 9th-level \npriest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal \nnumber of snakes. These snakes attack \ncommanded by the priest. There must, of \ncourse, be sticks or similar pieces of wood \n(such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into \nsnakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a \nstaff. Sticks held by creatures are dowed a \nsaving throw equal to that of the pos%cssor \n(i.e., a spear held by an orc must fail the \norc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical \nitems, such as staves and enchanted spears, \nare not affected by the spell. Only sticks \nwithin the area of effect are changed. The \ntype of snake created varies, but a typical \nspecimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a \nmovement rate of 9, and either ccmshicts \nfor ld4 + 1 points of damage per round or \nbites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The \nchance of a snake thus changed being ven- \nomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcast- \ner desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a \nmaximum 55% chance that any snake cre- \nated by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts \nfor two rounds for each experience level of \nthe spellcaster. \nThematerial components of the spell are a \nsmall piece of bark and several snake&. \nThe reverse changes normal-sized snakes \nto sticks for the same duration, or it negates \nthe sticks to snakes spell according to the \nlevel of the priest countering the spell (e.g., \na 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell \ncan turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks). \nTongues (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to speak and \ninderstand additional languages, whether \n:hey are racial tongues or regional dialects,"
