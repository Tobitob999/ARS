    "text": "checking morale. This spell counters (and is \ncountered by) fear. \n2. FeaT: The affected creatures flee in \npanic for 2d4 rounds. It counters (and is \ncountered by) couruge. \n3. Friendship: The affected creatures \nreact more positively (e.g., tolerance \nbecomes goodwill). It counters (and is coun- \ntered by) hate. \n4. Happiness: This effect creates joy and \na feeling of complacent well-being, adding \n+4 to all reaction rolls and making attack \nunlikely unless the creatures are subject to \nextreme provocation. It counters (and is \ncountered by) sadness. \n5. Hate: The affected creatures react \nmore negatively (e.g., tolerance becomes \nnegative neutrality). It counters (and is \ncountered by) friendship. \n6. Hope: The effect of hope is to raise \nmorale, saving throw rolls, attack rolls, and \ndamage caused by +2. It counters (and is \ncountered by) hopelessness. \n7. Hopelessness: The affected creatures \nsubmit to the demands of any opponent: \nsurrender, get out, etc. Otherwise, the crea- \ntures are 25% likely to do nothing in a \nround, and 25% likely to turn back or \nretreat. It counters (and is countered by) \nhope. \n8. Sadness: This creates unhappiness and \na tendency toward maudlin introspection. \nThis emotion increases chances of being sur- \nprised by - 1 and adds + 1 to initiative rolls. \nIt counters (and is countered by) happiness. \nAll creatures in the area at the instant the \nspell is cast are affected unless successful \nsaving throws vs. spell are made, adjusted \nfor Wisdom. The spell lasts as long as the \nwizard continues to concentrate on project- \ning the chosen emotion. Those who fail the \nsaving throw against fear must roll a new \nsaving throw if they return to the affected \narea. \nEnchanted Weapon (Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Weapon(s) touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell turns an ordinary weapon into \na magical one. The weapon is the equivalent \nof a +1 weapon, with +1 to attack and \ndamage rolls. Thus arrows, axes, bolts, \nbows, daggers, hammers, maces, spears, \nswords, etc., can be made into temporarily \nenchanted weapons. Two small (arrows, \nbolts, daggers, etc.) or one large (axe, bow, \nhammer, mace, etc.) weapon can beaffected \nby the spell. The spell functions on existing \nmagical weapons as long as the total com- \nbined bonus is +3 or less. \nMissile weapons enchanted in this way \nlose their enchantment when they success- \nfully hit a target, but otherwise the spell \nlasts its full duration. This spell is often used \nin combination with the enchant un item \nand permanency spells to create magical \nweapons, with this spell beii cast once per \ndesired plus of the bonus. \nThe material components of this spell are \npowdered lime and carbon. \nEnervation (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: ld4 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell temporarily suppresses the sub- \nject’s life force. The necromancer points his \nfinger and utters the incantation, releasing a \nblack bolt of crackling energy. The subject \nmust roll a saving throw vs. spell, adjusted \nfor Dexterity, to avoid the bolt. Success \nmeans the spell has no effect. Failure means \nthe subject is treated exactly as if he had \nbeen drained of energy levels by a wight, \none level for every four levels of the caster. \nHit Dice, spells, and other character details \ndependent on level are lost or reduced. \nThose drained to 0th level must make a sys- \ntem shock check to survive and are helpless \nuntil the spell expires. The spell effect even- \ntually wears off, either after ld4 hours plus \none hour per caster level, or after six hours \nof complete and undisturbed rest. Level \nabilities are regained, but lost spells must be \nrememorized. Undead are immune to this \nspell. \nEvard’s Black Tentacles \n(ConjuratiodSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 30 sq. ft./levei \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates many rubbery, black \ntentacles in the area of effect. These waving \nmembers seem to spring forth from the \nearth, floor, or whatever surface is \nunderfoot-including water. Each tentacle \nis 10 feet long, AC 4, and requires as many \npoints of damage to destroy as the level of \nthe wizard who cast the spell. There are ld4 \nsuch tentacles, plus one per experience level \nof the spellcaster. \nAny creature within range of the writhing \ntentacles is subject to attack as determined by \nthe DM. The target of a tentacle attack must \nroll a saving throw vs. spell. If this succeeds, \nthe subject suffers Id4 points of damage from \ncontact with the tentacle, and then the tentacle \nis destroyed. Failure to save indicates that the \ndamage inflicted is 2d4 points, the ebon mem- \nber is wrapped around its subj&, and damage \nwill be 3d4 points on the second and 8ucoeEd- \ning rounds. Since these tentacles have no in& \nthat they entwine any ow-a tree, post, pil- \nlar, even the wizard himself-or continue to \nsqueeze a dead opponent. A grasping hokl \nestablished by a tentacle remains until the ten- \ntacle is destroyed by some form of attack or \nuntil it disappears at theend ofthe spell’s dura- \ntion. \nThe component for this spell is a piece of \ntentacle from a giant octopus or giant squid. \nligence to guide them, there is the possibility \nExtension I (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Mect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of an extension I spell, the wizard \nprolongs the duration of a previously cast \n1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell by 50%. Thus, \na levitation spell can be made to function 15 \nminutedlevel, a hold person spell made to \nwork for three rounds/level, etc. Naturally, \nthe spell affects only spells that have dura- \ntions. This spell must be cast immediately \nafter the spell to be extended, either by the \noriginal caster or another wizard. If a com- \nplete round or more elapses, the extension \nfails and is wasted. \nFeu (IlIusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 60’ long cone, 30’ diameter \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nat end, 5’ at base \nWhen a fear spell is cast, the wizard sends \nforth an invisible cone of terror that causes \ncreatures within its area of effect to turn \naway from the caster and flee in panic. \nAffected creatures are likely to drop what- \never they are holding when struck by the \nspell: the base chance of this is 60% at 1st \nlevel (or at 1 Hit Die), and each level (or Hit \nDie) above this reduces the probability by \n5 % . Thus at 10th level there is only a 15 % \nchance, and at 13th level no chance, of \ndropping items. Creatures affected by fear \nflee at their fastest rate for a number of \nmelee rounds equal to the level of experi- \nence of the spellcaster. Undead and crea- \ntures that successfully roll their saving \nthrows vs. the spell are not affected. \nThe material component of this spell is \neither the heart of a hen or a white feather. \n157"
