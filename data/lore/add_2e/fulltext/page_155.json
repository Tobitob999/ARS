(If in doubt, a saving \nthrow vs. spell determines whether the sub- \nject maintains its grasp.) Normal insects \ncannot pass such a barrier. Loose materials, \neven cloth garments, fly upward when \ncaught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are \ndeflected upward and miss, while sling \nstones and other missiles under two pounds \nin weight receive a -4 penalty to a first shot \nand -2 penalties thereafter. Gases, most \nbreath weapons, and creatures in gaseous \nform cannot pass this wall, although it is no \nbarrier to noncorporeal creatures. \nThe material components are a tiny fan \nand a feather of exotic origin. \nWalthform (Alteration, Illusion) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard and all \nof his gear become insubstantial. The caster \nis subject only to magical or special attacks, \nincluding those by weapons of + 1 or better, \nor by creatures otherwise able to affect \nthose struck only by magical weapons. \nUndead of most sorts will ignore an individ- \nwl in wraithform, believing him to be a \nwraith or spectre, though a lich or special \nundead may save vs. spell with a - 4 penal- \nty to recognize the spell. \nThe wizard can pass through small holes \nor narrow openings, even mere cracks, with \nall he wears or holds in his hands, as long as \nthe spell persists. Note, however, that the \nthe caster cannot fly without additional \nmagic. No form of attack is possible when in \nwraithform, except against creatures that \nexist on the Ethereal plane, where all attacks \n(both ways) are nod. A successful dispel \nmagic spell forces the wizard in wraithform \nback to normal form. The spellcaster can \nend the spell with a single word. \nThe material components for the spell are \na bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke. \nii if!! \nI \nFourth-Level Spells \nCharm Monster (EnchantmentKhann) \nwe: 60 yards \nZomponents: V, S \nhation: Special \nZasting Time: 4 \n4rea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 20- \nfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is similar to a charm person \n;pell, but it can affect any living creature- \n)r several low-level creatures. The spell \nlffects 2d4 Hit Dice or levels of creatures, \ndthough it only affects one creature of 4 or \n154 \nmore Hit Dice or levels, regardks of the \nnumber rolled. \nAll possible subjects receive saving \nthrows vs. spell, adjusted for Wisdom. Any \ndamage inflicted by the caster or his allies in \nthe round of casting grants the wounded \ncreature another saving throw at a bonus of \n+1 per point of darnage dved. Any \naffected creature regards the spellcaster as \nfriendly, an ally or companion to be treated \nwell or guarded from harm. If communica- \ntion is possible, the charmed creature fd- \nlows reasonable requests, instructium, or \norders most faithfully (see the suggestion \nspell). If communication is not possible, the \ncreature does not harm the caster, but others \nin the vicinity may be subject to its inten- \ntions, hostile or otherwise. Any overtly hos- \ntile act by the caster breaks the spell, or at \nthe very least allows a new saving throw \nagainst the charm. Affected creatures even- \ntually come out from under the influence of \nthe spell. This is a function of the creature’s \nlevel (i.e., its Hit Dice). \nPcrrentch.na! \norHLtDice Bnaking Spa \nMonsterLevel Week of \n1st or up to 2 5% \n2ndorupto3 + 2 10% \n15 % \n4th or up to 6 3% \n5thorupto7+2 35% \n45% \n7th or up to 10 60% \n8th or up to 12 75 % \n9th or over 12 90% \n3rd or up to 4 + 4 \n6th or up to 8 +4 \nThe exact day of the week and time of day \nis seaetly determined. \nConfusion (Enchantmenvchum) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Up to afoot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell causes cwon in one or more \ncreatures within the uca, creating indeci- \nsion and the inability to take effective \naction.
