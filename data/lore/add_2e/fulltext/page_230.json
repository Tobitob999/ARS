The \ndepth and length of the trough created by \nthe spell depends on the level of the priest. A \ntrough three feet deep per caster level, by 30 \nyards wide, by 20 yards long per level is cre- \nated. Thus at 12th level, the priest would \npart water 36 feet deep by 30 yards wide by \n240 yards long. The trough remains as long \nas the spell lasts or until the priest who cast \nit opts to end its effects. Existing currents \nappear to flow through the parted water, \nalthough swimming creatures and physical \nobjects such as boats do not enter the rift \nwithout strenuous and deliberate effort. If \ncast underwater, this spell creates an air cyl- \ninder of appropriate length and diameter. If \ncast directly on a water elemental or other \nwater-based creature, the creature receives \n4d8 points of damage and must roll a suc- \ncessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in panic \nfor 3d4 rounds. \nThe material component of this spell is \nthe Driest’s holv svmbol. \nSpeak With Monsters (Alteration) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 round/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen cast, the speak with monsters spell \nenables the priest to converse with any type \nof creature that has any form of communi- \ncative ability (including empathic, tactile, \npheromonic, etc.). That is, the monster \nunderstands, in its own language or equiva- \nlent, the intent of what is said to it by the \npriest and vice versa. The creature thus spo- \nken to is checked by your DM in order to \ndetermine reaction. All creatures of the \nsame type as that chosen by the priest can \nlikewise understand if they are within \nrange. The priest can speak to different \ntypes of creatures during the spell duration, \nbut he must speak separately to each type. \nThe spell lasts for two rounds per caster \nlevel. \nStone Tell (Divination) \nSphere: Elemental (Earth), Divination \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic yard of stone \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the priest casts a stone teff spell \nupon an area, the very stones speak and \nrelate to the caster who or what has touched \nthem as well as telling what is covered; con- \ncealed, or simply behind them. The stones \nrelate complete descriptions, if asked. Note \nthat a stone’s perspective, perception, and \nknowledge may hinder this divination; such \ndetails, if any, are decided by the DM. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of mercury and a bit of clay. \nlkansmute Water to Dust (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Water, Earth) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic yard/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen this spell is cast, the subject area \ninstantly undergoes a change from liquid to \npowdery dust. Note that if the water is \nalready muddy, the area of effect is doubled, \nwhile if wet mud is present, the area of effect \nis quadrupled. If water remains in contact \nwith the transmuted dust, the former quick- \nly permeates the latter, turning the dust into \nsilty mud, if a sufficient quantity of water \nexists to do so, otherwise soaking or damp- \nening the dust accordingly. \nOnly the liquid actually in the area of \neffect at the moment of spellcasting is affect- \ned. Potions that contain water as a compo- \nnent part are rendered useless. Living \ncreatures are unaffected, except for those \nnative to the elemental plane of Water. Such \ncreatures must roll a successful saving \nthrows vs. death or be slain; however, only \none such creature can be affected by any sin- \ngle casting of this spell, regardless of the \ncreature’s size or the size of the spell’s area of \neffect. \nThe reverse of this spell is simply a very \nhigh-powered create water spell that \nrequires a pinch of normal dust as an addi- \ntional material component. \nFor either usage of the spell, other compo- \nnents required are diamond dust of at least \n500 gp value, a bit of seashell, and the cast- \ner’s holy.symbo1. \nlkansport Vir Plants (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nenter any large plant (human-sized or 1, \ner) and pass any distance to a plant of \nsame species in a single round, regardla \nthe distance, separating the two. The c11 \nplant must be alive. The destination p \nneed not be familiar to the caster, but it ab0 \nmust be alive. If the caster is uncertain of the \ndestination plant, he need merely determine \ndirection and distance, and the transport via \nplants spell moves him as close as possible \nto the desired location. There is a basic 20% \nchance, reduced by 1% per level of experi- \nence of the caster, that the transport delivers \nthe caster to a similar species of plant from 1 \nto 100 miles away from the desired destina- \ntion plant. If a particular destination plant is \ndesired, but the plant is not living, the spell \nfails and the caster must come forth from \nthe entrance plant within 24 hours. Note \nthat this spell does not function with pla;m- \nlike creatures-e.g., shambling md, \ntreants, etc. The destruction of an OcGUpicd \nplant slays the caster (see the plant door \nspell). \nTurn Wood (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 120-foot-wide path, \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, waves of force roll \nforth from the caster, moving in the direc- \ntion he faces, and causing all woodm \nobjects in the path of the spell to be pushed \naway from the caster to the limit of the area \nof effect. Wooden objects above three inch- \nes in diameter that are fixed firmly are not \naffected, but loose objects (movable man- \ntles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects \nunder three inches in diameter that are fixed \nsplinter and break, and the pieces move \nwith the wave of force. Thus, objects such \nas wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon \nshafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are \npushed back, dragging those carrying them \nwith them. If a spear is planted in order to \nprevent this forced movement, it splinters. \nEven magical items with wooden sections \nare turned, although an anti-magic shell \nblocks the effects. A successful dispel magic \nspell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn \n20 feet long/lewl \n229"
