    "text": "last five steps). A shrinking object mal \ndamage weaker materials affixed to it, bui \nan object will shrink only as long as the ob. \nject itself is not damaged. Unwilling crea- \ntures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. \nThe material component of this spell is a \npinch of powdered iron. \nErase (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 scroll or 2 pages \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe erase spell removes writings of either \nmagical or mundane nature from a scroll or \nfrom one to two pages of paper, parchment, \nor similar surfaces. It removes explosive \nrunes, glyphs of warding, sepia snake sigik, \nand wizard marks, but it does not remove iJ- \nJusory script or symbols (see these spells). \nNonmagical writings are automatically \nerased if the caster is touching them, other- \nwise the chance for success is 90%. Magical \nwritings must be touched, and are only 30% \nlikely to be erased, plus 5 % per caster level, \nto a maximum of 90% (e.g., 35% for a 1st- \nlevel caster, 40% for a 2nd-level caster, \netc.). \n. \nFeather Fall (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the creature(s) or \nobject(s) affected immediately assumes the \nmass of a piece of down. Rate of falling is in- \nstantly changed to a mere two feet per sec- \nond (120 feet per round), and no damage is \nincurred upon landing while the spell is in \neffect. However, when the spell duration \nceases, normal rate of fall occurs. The spell \ncan be cast upon the wizard or some other \ncreature or object up to the maximum range \nand lasts for one round for each level of the \nwizard. The feather fall affects one or more \nobjects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as \nlong as the maximum weight of the crea- \ntures or objects does not exceed a combined \ntotal of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per \nlevel of the spellcaster. \nFor example, a 2nd-level wizard has a \nrange of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, \nand a weight limit of 600 pounds when cast- \ning this spell. The spell works only upon \nfree-falling, flying, or propelled objects \n(such as missiles). It does not affect a sword \nblow or a charging creature. Note that the \nspell can be effectively combined with gust \nof wind and similar spells. \nFind Familiar (Conjuratiotr/Sumrnoning) \nRange: 1 mile/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2d12 hours \nArea of Effect: 1 familiar \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the caster to attempt to \nsummon a familiar to act as his aide and \ncompanion. Familiars are typically small \ncreatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, \nhawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, wea- \nsels, or even mice. A creature acting as a fa- \nmiliar can benefit a wizard, conveying its \nsensory powers to its master, conversing \nwith him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy \nas well. A wizard can have only one familiar \nat a time, however, and he has no control \nover what sort of creature answers the sum- \nmoning, if any at all come. \nThe creature is always more intelligent \nthan others of its type (typically 2 or 3 Int \npoints), and its bond with the wizard con- \nfers upon it an exceptionally long life. The \nwizard receives the heightened senses of his \nfamiliar, which grants the wizard a +1 bo- \nnus to all surprise die rolls. Normal famil- \niars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per \ncaster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to \nsize, speed, etc.). \nThe wizard has an empathic link with the \nfamiliar and can issue it mental commands \nat a distance of up to one mile. Note that \nempathic responses from the familiar are \ngenerally fairly basic-while able to com- \nmunicate simple thoughts, these are often \noverwhelmed by instinctual responses. \nThus a ferret familiar spying on a band of \norcs in the woods might lose its train of \nthought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly \nits communications to its master would be \ntinged with fear of the “big ones” it was spy- \ning on! The caster cannot see through the fa- \nmiliar’s eyes. \nIf separated from the caster, the familiar \nloses 1 hit point each day, and dies if re- \nduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in \nphysical contact with its wizard, it gains the \nwizards saving throws against special at- \nbacks. If a special attack would normally \n:ause damage, the familiar suffers no dam- \nage if the saving throw is successful and half \nlamage if the saving throw is failed. If the \n:amiliar dies, the wizard must successfully \n-011 an immediate system shock check or \niie. Even if he survives this check, the wiz- \nird loses 1 point from his Constitution \nvhen the familiar dies. \nThe power of the conjuration is such that \nt can be attempted but once per year. When \nhe wizard decides to find a familiar, he \nnust load a brass brazier with charcoal. \nVhen this is burning well, he adds 1,ooO g~ \nworth of incense and herbs. The spell incan- \nation is then begun and must be continued \n134 \nuntil the familiar comes or the casting time \nis finished. The DM secretly determines all \nresults. Note that most familiars are not in- \nherently magical, nor does a dispel magic \nspell send them away. \nDeliberate mistreatment, failure to feed \nand care for the familiar, or continuous un- \nreasonable demands have adverse effects on \nthe familiar’s relationship with its master. \nPurposely arranging the death of one‘s own \nfamiliar incurs great disfavor from certain \npowerful entities, with dire results. \nRoll Familiar * Sensory Powers \n1-5 Cat, black Excellent night vision & \nsuperior hearing \n6-7 Crow Excellent vision \n8-9 Hawk Very superior distance \nvision \n10-11 owl Night vision equals hu- \nman daylight vision, su- \nperior hearing \nSuperior hearing & very \nsuperior olfactory power \nD20 \n12-13 Toad Wide-angle vision \n14-15 Weasel \n16-20 No familiar available within \n* The referee can substitute other small anl- \nmals suitable to the area. \nspell range \nFriends (EnchantmenvCharm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nA friends spell causes the wizard to tem- \nporarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma. Intel- \nligent creatures within the area of effect at \nthe time the spell is cast must make immedi- \nate reaction checks based on the character’s \nnew Charisma. Those with favorable reac- \ntions tend to be very impressed with the \nspellcaster and make an effort to be his \nFriends and help him, as appropriate to the \nsituation. Officious bureaucrats might de- \n:ide to become helpful; surly gate guards \nmight wax informative; attacking orcs \nnight spare the caster’s life, taking him cap- \nive instead. When the spell wears off, the \n:reatures realize that they have been influ- \nmced, and their reactions are determined by \nhe DM. \nThe components for this spell are chalk \nor white flour), lampblack (or soot), and \nrermilion applied to the face before casting \nhe spell."
