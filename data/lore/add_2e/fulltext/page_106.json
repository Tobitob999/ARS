Indeed, one of his \nmain ambitions may be to destroy his \nformer companions or cause them as much \ngrief as possible. \nFurthermore, the newly undead NPC is \nunder the total control of the undead who \nslew it. If this master is slain, its wdead \nminions gain one level for each level they \ndrain from victims until they reach the max- \nimum Hit Dice for their kind. Upon reach- \ning full Hit Dice, these undead are able to \nacquire their own minions (by slaying char- \nacters). \nAppropriate actions on the part of the \nother player characters can prevent a drained \ncomrade from becoming undead. The steps \nmcessary vary with each type of undead and \nare explained in the monster descriptions in \nthe Monstrous Compendium. \nPolson \nThis is an all-too fre- \nquent hazard faced by player characters. \nBites, stings, deadly potions, drugged \nwines, and bad food all await characters at \nthe hands of makvoknt wizards, evil assas- \nsins, hideous monsters, and incompetent \ninnkeepers. Spiders, snakes, centipedes, \nscorpions, wyverns, and certain giant frogs \nall have poisons deadly to characters. Wise \nPCs quickly learn to respect and fear such \ncreatures. \nThe strength of different poisons varies \nwildly and is fivquently overestimated. The \nbite of the greatly feared black widow spi- \nder kins a victim in the United States only \nonce every other year. Only about 2 % of all \nrattksnake bites prove fatal. \nAt the other extreme, there are natural \npoisons of intense lethality. Fortunately, \nsuch poisons tend to be exotic and rare-the \ngolden arrow-poison frog, the western tai- \npan snake, and the stonefish a11 produce \nFurthermore, the effect of a poison de- \npends on how it is delivered. Most fre- \nquently, it must be injected into the \nbloodstream by bite or sting. Other poisons \nare only effective if swallowed; aseassins fa- \nvor these for doctoring food. By far the \nmost deadly variety, however, is contact \npoison, which need only touch the skin to \nbe effective. \nParalytic poisons leave the character un- \nable to move for 2d6 hours. His body is \nlimp, making it difficult for others to move \nhim. The character suffers no other ill ef- \nfects from the poison, but his condition can \nlead to quite a few problems for his compan- \nions. \nDebilitating poisons weaken the charac- \nter for ld3 days. All of the character's abil- \nity scores are reduced by half during this \ntime. All appropriate adjustments to attack \nrolls, damage, Armor Class, etc., from the \nhighly MY Poi==.. \nlowered ability scores are applied during the \ncourse of the illness. Furthermore, the char- \nacter moves at one-half his normal move- \nment rate. Finally, the character cannot heal \nby normal or magical means until the poi- \nson is neutralized or the duration of the de- \nbilitation is elapsed. \nTreating Poison Victims \nFortunately, there are many ways a char- \nacter can be treated for poison. Several \nspells exist that either slow the onset time, \nenabling the character the chance to get fur- \nther treatment, or negate the poison en- \ntirely. However, cure spells (including hean \ndo not negate the progress of a poison, and \nneutralize poison doesn't recover hit points \nalready lost to the effects of poison. In addi- \ntion, characters with herbalism proficiency \ncan take steps to reduce the danger poison \npresents to player characters. \nHealing \nOnce a character is \nwounded, his player will naturally want to \nget him healed. Characters can heal either \nby natural or magical means. Natural heal- \ning is slow, but it's available to all charac- \nters, regardless of class. Magical healing \nmay or may not be available, depending on \nthe presence (or absence) of spellusters or \nmagical devices. \nThe only limit to the amount of damage a \ncharacter can recovet through healing is the \ntotal hit points the character has. A charac- \nter cannot exceed this limit until he gains a \nnew level, whereupon another Hit Die (or a \nset number of points) is added to his total. \nHealii can never restore more hit points to \na character than his maximum hit point to- \ntal. \nNatural Healing \nchmctem heal nat- \nurally at a rate of 1 hit point per day of rest. \nRest is defined as low activity-mthing \nmore stremrous than riding a horse or trav- \neling from one place to another. Fighting, \nrunning in fear, lifting a heavy Wder, or \nany other physical activity, prevents rest- \ning, since it strains old wounds d may \nevenreopenthem. \nIf a character has complete bed rest (do- \ni- nothing for anentire day), he can regain \n3 hit points for the day. For each complete \nweek of bed rest, tbe &wader can add any \nConstitution hit point bonus he might have \nto the base d 21 points (3 points pa day) he \nregained &&g that week. \nIn both cases above, the character is as- \nsumed to be getting adequate food, water, \nand sleep. If these are lacking, the character \ndoes not regain any hit points that day. \nMagical Heall- \nHealing spells, po- \ntions, and magical devices can speed the \nprocess of healing considerably. The spe- \ncifics of such magical healing methods are \ndescribed in the spell descriptions in this \nbook and in the DMG (for magical items). \nBy using these methods, wounds dose in- \nstantly and vigor is restored. The effects are \nimmediate. \nMagical healing is particularly useful in \nthe midst of combat or in preparation for a \ngrievous encounter. Remember, however \nthat the characters' opponents are just as \nlikely to have access to magical he- as \nthe player characters-an evil high priest is \nlikely to carry healing speIls to bestow on \nhis own followers and guards. Heding is \nnot, of itself, a good or evil act. \nRemember that under no circumstances \ncan a character be healed to a point greater \nthan his original hit point total. For exam- \nple, say a character has 30 hit points, but \nsuffers 2 points of damage in a fit. A while \nlater, he takes an additional point of dam- \nage, bringing his current hit point total to \n27. A spelkmter cottldn't restore more than \n3 poinb to him, regardless of the healing \nmethod d. Any excess points are lost. \nHcrlutlrm a Hdlng Profl \nCbacter Deatb \nreaches 0 hit points, \nThe character is tmmsdktdy \nable to do mything des sow \nmagideffect'takespl.eadmce. \nDeath From Pokon \ncates \nwho \nhive \nPoisons remain dfective for 2db honnr af- \nactive venom in his system.
