    "text": "The AD&W game is an adventure game de- \nsigned to give players a feeling of excitement \nand danger. Characters brave the unknown \nperils of moldering dungeons and thorn- \ncovered wilderness, facing off against hid- \neous monsters and evil villains. Thus, it is \nimportant for all players to know the basic \nTo create the proper sense of danger and \nexcitement, the rules for combat must be \nthorough, but they must also be playable \nand exciting enough to create a vivid picture \nin the minds of the players. Combat in the \nADhD game has to allow many different \nactions and outcomes-as many as the \nimagination can produce. Knowing that \nanything could happen next (because the \nrules allow it) creates excitement for every- \none. \n' rules for handling combat. \nMore Than Just Hack-and-Slash \nAs important as \nfighting is to the ADhD game, it isn't the be- \nall and end-all of play. It's just one way for \ncharacters to deal with situations. If charac- \nters could do nothing but fight, the game \nwould quickly get boring-every encounter \nwould be the same. Because there is more to \nthe game than fighting, we'll cover much \nmore than simple hack-and-slash combat in \nthis chapter. \nIn addition to explaining the basic me- \nchanics of hitting and missing, there are \nrules here for turning undead, special ways \nto attack and defend, poison, heroic feats, \nand more. \n, \n1 \nDefinitions \nMany game terms \nare used throughout the combat rules. To \nunderstand the rules, players must under- \nstand these terms, so brief explanations ap- \npear below. Further details are provided \nthroughout this chapter. \nArmor Class (AC) is the protective rating \nof a type of armor. In some circumstances, \nAC is modified by the amount of protection \ngained or lost because of the character's situ- \nation. For instance, crouching behind a \nboulder improves a character's Armor \nClass, while being attacked from behind \nworsens his AC. \nArmor provides protection by reducing \nthe chance that a character is attacked suc- \ncessfully (and suffers damage). Armor does \nnot absorb damage, it prevents it. A fighter \nin full plate mail may be a slow-moving tar- \nget, but penetrating his armor to cause any \ndamage is no small task. \nArmor Class is measured on a scale from \n10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best \n(very powerful magical armors). The lower \nthe number, the more effective the armor. \nShields can also improve the AC of a char- \nacter (see page 75). \n* \nAbilities and situations can also affect a \ncharacter's Armor Class. High Dexterity \ngives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. \nBut even a character with a Dexterity bonus \ncan have this bonus negated if he is attacked \nfrom the rear. \nDamage is what happens to a character \nwhen an opponent attacks him successfully. \nDamage can also occur as a result of poison, \nfire, falling, acid, and anything even re- \nmotely dangerous in the real world. Dam- \nage from most attacks is measured in hit \npoints. Each time a character is hit, he suf- \nfers points of damage: It could be as little as \n1 point to as many as 80 or more. These \npoints are subtracted from the character's \ncurrent hit point total. When this reaches 0, \nthe character is dead. \nInitiative determines the order in which \nthings happen in a combat round. Like so \nmany things in the world, initiative is deter- \nmined by a combination of ability, situa- \ntion, and chance. \nAt the start of each round of a battle, an \ninitiative roll is made by both sides. This \nroll can be modified by the abilities of the \ncombatants and by the situation. The per- \nson or side with the lower modified die roll \nacts first. \nMelee is any situation in which charac- \nters are battling each other hand-to-hand, \nwhether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, \naxes, pikes, or something else. Strength and \nDexterity are valuable assets in melee. \nMissile combat is defined as any time a \nweapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or \notherwise propelled. Missile and melee \ncombat have the same basic rules, but there \nare special situations and modifiers that ap- \nply only to missile combat. \nSaving throws are measures of a charac- \nter's resistance to special types of attacks- \npoisons, magic, and attacks that affect the \nwhole body or mind of the character. The \nability to make successful saving throws im- \nproves as the character increases in level; \nDexterity and general mental fortitude aid \nin honing combat senses. Experience makes \nsaving throws easier. \nSurprise can happen any time characters \nmeet another group unscpectedly (monsters, \nevdhights, peasank, etc.). surprk issimply \nwhat happens when one side-a person or \nparty-is taken unable to react ~n- \ntil they gab their wits. Their opponents, if \nunsurprised, are &owed a bonus round of \naction while the surprised characters recover. \nIt's entirely possible for both sides in a given \nsituation to be surprisedl \nAttacking with surprise gives bonuses to \nthe attack roll (see Table 51). A surprised \ncharacter also has a decreased chance of \nrolling a successful saving throw, if one is \nneeded. \nSurprise is determined by a die roll and is \nnormally checked at the beginning of an \nencounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, \n89 \nso there are very few modifiers to the roll. \nTHACO is an acronym for 'To Hit Armor \nClass 0.\" This is the number a character, \nNPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor \nClass 0 target succdy. THACO depends \non a character's group and level (see Table \n53 on page 91). The THACO number can be \nused to calculate the number needed to hit \nany Armor Class. THACO is refigured each \ntime a character increases in level. Using \nTHACO speeds the play of combat greatly. \nThe Attack Roll \nAt the heart of the \ncombat system is the attack roll. This is the \ndie roll that determines whether an attack \nsucceeds or fails. The number a player needs \nin order to make a successful attack roll is \nalso called the \"to-hit\" number. \nAttack rolls are used for attacks with \nswords, bows, rocks, and other weapons, as \nwell as blows from fists, tackling, and other \nhand-to-hand attacks. Attack rolls are also \nused to resolve a variety of potentially \ninjury-causing actions that require accuracy \n(e.g., throwing a rock at a small target or \ntossing a sword to a party member in the \nmiddle of a fight). \nFiguring the To-Hit Number \nThe first step in \nmaking an attack roll is to find the number \nneeded to hit the target. Subtract the Armor \nClass of the target from the attacker's \nTHACO. (Remember that if the Armor \nClass is a negative number, you add it to the \nattacker's THACO.) The character has to \nroll the rSUlting number, or higher, on ld20 \nto hit the target. \nHere's a simple example: Rath has \nreached 7th level as a fighter. His THACO is \n14 (found on Table 53), meaning he needs to \nroll a 14 or better to hit a character or crea- \nture of Armor Class 0. In combat, Rath, at- \ntacking an orc wearing chainmail mor \n(AC 6), needs to roll an 8 (14 -6 = 8) to hit \nthe orc. An 8 or higher on Id20 will hit the \norc. If Rath hits, he rolls the appropriate \ndice (see Table 44) to determine how much \ndamage he inflicts. \nThe example above is quite simple-in a \ntypical AD&D@ game combat situation, \nTHACO is modified by weapon bonuses, \nStrength bonuses, and the like (the next sec- \ntion \"Modifiers to the Attack Roll:' lists the \nspecifics of these modifiers). Figure Strength \nand weapon modifiers, subtract the total \nfrom the base THACO, and record this mod- \nified THACO with each weapon on the char- \nacter sheet. Subtract the target's Armor \nClass from this modified THACO when de- \ntermining the to-hit number, \nI \nI"
