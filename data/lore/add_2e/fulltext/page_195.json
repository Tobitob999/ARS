Only magical items \ncan be brought into the! Astral plane \n(although nonmagical items could be ren- \ndered temporarily magical through the use \nof some spells, if the DM allows). As the \nAstral plane touches upon all of the first \nlevels of the outer planes, the wizard can \ntravel astrally to any of these outer planes as \nhe wills. The caster then leaves the Astral \nplane, forming a body in the plane of exist- \nence he has chosen to enter. It is also possi- \nble to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime \nMaterial plane by means of the astral spell, \nbut a second body cannot be formed in the \nPrime Material plane. As a general rule, a \nperson astrally projected can be seen only \nby creatures in the Astral plane. \nAt all times, the astral body is connected \nto the material body by a silvery cord. If the \ncord is broken, the affected person is killed, \nastrally and materially, but normally only \nthe psychic wind can cause the cord to \nbreak. When a second body is formed in a \ndifferent plane, the silvery cord remains \ninvisibly attached to the new body. If the \nastral form is slain, the cord simply returns \nto the original body where it rests in the \nPrime Material plane, reviving it from its \nstate of suspended animation. \nAlthough astrally projected persons are \nable to function in the Astral plane, their \nactions do not affect creatures not existing \nin the Astral plane. The spell lasts until the \nwizard desires to end it, or until it is termi- \nnated by some outside means (a dispel mag- \nic spell or destruction of the wizards body \nin the Prime Material plane). \nThe wizard can project the astral forms of \nup to seven other creatures with him by \nmeans of the astral spell, providing the crea- \ntures are linked in a circle with the wizard. \nThese fellow travelers are dependent upon \nthe wizard and can be stranded. Travel in \nthe Astral plane can be slow or fast accord- \ning to the wizards desire. The ultimate des- \ntination arrived at is subject to the \nconceptualization of the mage. (See the \nManual of the Planes for further informa- \ntion on the Astral plane and astral projec- \ntion.) \nAny magical items can go into the Astral \nplane, but most become temporarily non- \nmagical therein, or in any planes removed \nfrom the Prime Material plane. Armor and \nweapons of +3 or better might function in \nother planes at the DMs option. Artifacts \nand relics function anywhere. Items draw- \ning their power from a given plane are more \npowerful in that plane (e.g., a ring of fire \nresistance in the elemental plane of Fire or a \nsword of life stealing in the Negative Mate- \nrial plane). \nBigby’s Crushing Hand (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe Bigby’s crushing hand spell creates a \nhuge, disembodied hand similar to those of \nthe other Bigby’s hand spells. The crushing \nhand is under the mental control of the cast- \ner, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze \nan opponent. No attack roll is necessary; \nthe hand automatically grasps and inflicts \nconstriction damage any round in which the \nwizard concentrates. The damage inflicted \ndepends on the number of rounds it acts \nupon the victim: \n1st round Id10 hit points \n2nd and 3rd rounds 2d10 hit points \n4th &beyond 4d10 hit points \nThe crushing hand has an Armor Class of \n0, has as many hit points as its caster at full \nstrength, and vanishes when destroyed. The \nhand is susceptible to normal combat \nattacks and damaging spells, but if it is \nstruck by an area-effect spell, the person \nheld suffers the same fate as the hand (i.e., if \nthe hand fails its saving throw, the victim \nautomatically fails his). The hand is not \neffective against noncorporeal or gaseous \nforms, but it does prevent creatures that are \nable to slip through small cracks from \nescaping. If the hand grasps an item or con- \nstruction, the appropriate saving throw \nmust be made as if squeezed by a Strength of \n25. \nThe material components of the spell are \na glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg. \nCrystalbrittle (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 2 cubic ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe magic of this spell causes metal, \nwhether as soft as gold or as hard as ada- \nmantite, to turn to a crystalline substance as \nbrittle and fragile as crystal. Thus a sword, \n1 04 \ngolem can be changed to a delicate, glass- \nlike material easily shattered by any forceful \nblow. Furthermore, this change is unalter- \nable short of a-wish spell; a dispel magic will \nnot reverse the spell. \nThe caster must physically touch the \nitem-if it is an opponent or something an \nopponent is using or wearing, the wizard \nmust get into melee add roll a successful \nattack roll. Any single metal item can be \naffected by the spell. Thus a suit of armor \nworn by a creature can be changed to crys- \ntal, but the creature’s shield would not be \naffected, or vice versa. All items gain a sav- \ning throw equal to their magical bonus val- \nue or protection (the DM has this \ninformation). A +1/ +3 sword would get a \n10% (average of the two pluses) chance to \nsave; + 5 magical armor has a 25 % chance \nto be unaffected; an iron golem has a 15% \nchance to save (for it is hit only by magical \nweapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts \nand relics constructed of metal may be \naffected at the discretion of the DM (this is \nhighly unlikely). Affected items not imme- \ndiately protected are shattered and perma- \nnently destroyed if struck by a normal blow \nfrom a metal tool or any weighty weapon, \nincluding a staff. \nEnergy Drain (Evocation, Necromancy) \nRange: Touch $ \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard opens a \nchannel between the plane he is in and the \nNegative Material plane, the caster becom- \ning the conductor between the two planes. \nAs soon as he touches (equal to a hit if melee \nis involved) any living creature, the victim \nloses two levels (as if struck by a spectre). A \nmonster loses 2 Hit Dice permanently, both \nfor hit points and attack ability. A character \nloses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abili- \nties permanently (until regained through \nadventuring, if applicable). \nThe material component of this spell is \nessence of spectre or vampire dust. Prepara- \ntion requires mere moments, then the mate- \nrial component is cast forth, and upon \ntouching the victim, the wizard speaks the \ntriggering word, causing the spell to take \neffect instantly. \nThe spell remains effective for a single \nround only. Humans or humanoids brought \nbelow zero energy levels by this spell can be \nanimated as juju zombies under the control \nof the caster. \nThe caster always has a 5% (1 in 20) \nchance to be affected by the dust, losing one \npoint of Constitution at the same time as the"
