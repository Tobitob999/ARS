    "text": "The priest needs his religious symbol, \nprayer beads or wheel or book, and burning \nincense. \nCommune (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of a commune spell, the priest is \nable to contact his divinity-or agents \nthereof-and request information in the \nform of questions that can be answered by a \nsimple \"yes\" or \"no.\" The priest is allowed \none such question for every experience level \nhe has attained. The answers given are cor- \nrect within the limits of the entity's knowl- \nedge (\"I don't know\" is a legitimate answer, \nas powerful outer planar beings are not nec- \nessarily omniscient). Optionally, the DM \nmay give a single short answer, of five \nwords or less. The spell will, at best, pro- \nvide information to aid character decisions. \nEntities communed with structure their an- \nswers to further their own purposes. .It is \nprobable that the DM will limit the use of \ncommune spells to one per adventure, one \nper week, or wen one per month, for the \ngreater powers dislike frequent intermp- \ntions. Likewise, if the caster lags, discusses \nthe answers, or goes off to do anything else, \nthe spell immediately ends. \nThe material components necessary to a \ncommune spell are the priest's religious sym- \nbol, holy (unholy) water, and incense. If a \nparticularly potent commune is needed, a \nsacrifice proportionate with the difficulty of \nobtaining the information is required, and if \nthe offering is insufficient, only partial or no \ninformation is gained, \nCommune With Nature (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to become \none with nature in the area, thus being em- \npowered with knowledge of the surround- \ning temtory. For each level of experience of \nthe caster, he can \"know\" one fact: the \nground ahead, left or right; the plants \nahead, left or right; the minerals ahead, left \nor right; the water courses/bodies of water \nahead, left or right; the people dwelling \nahead, left or right; the general animal pop \nulation, left or right; the presence of wood- \nland creatures, left or right; etc. The \n1 \npresence of powerful unnatural creatures \ncan also be detected, as can the general state \nof the naturil setting. The spell is most ef- \nfective in outdoor settings, operating in a \nradius of onehalf mile for each level of the \ncaster. In natural underground settings- \ncaves, caverns, etc.-the range is limited to \n10 yards per caster level. In constructed set- \ntings (dungeons and towns), the spell will \nnot function. The DM may limit the casting \nof this spell to once per month. \nControl Winds (Alteration) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 40-foot/level radius \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of a control winds spell, the \ncaster is able to alter wind force in the area \nof effect. For every three levels of experi- \nence, the caster can increase or decrease \nwind force by one level of strength. Wind \nstrengths are as follows: \nWind Force Miles Per Hour \nModerate Breeze 8-18 \nLight Breeze 2-7 \nStrong Breeze 19-31 \nGale 32-54 \nstorm 55-72 \nHurricane 73-176 \nWinds in excess of 19 miles per hour drive \nsmall flying creatures (those eagle-sized and \nunder) from the skies, severely affect missile \naccuracy, and make sailing difficult. Winds \nin excess of 32 miles per hour drive even \nman-sized flying creatures from the skies \nand cause minor ship damage. Winds in ex- \ncess of 55 miles per hour>drive all flying \ncreatures from the skies, uproot trees of \nsmall size, knock down wooden structures, \ntear off roofs, etc., and endanger ships. \nWinds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of \nhurricane force. \nAn \"eye\" of @foot radius, in which the \nwind is calm, exists around the caster. Note \nthat while the spell can be used in under- \nground places, the eye shrinks one foot for \nevery foot of confinement, if the spell is cast \nin an area smaller than the area of effect. \n(For example, if the area of effect is a 360- \nfoot radius, and the space only allows a 350- \nfoot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a \n30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in ra- \ndius would eliminate the eye and subject the \nspellcaster to the effects of the wind.) \nOnce the spell is cast, the wind force in- \ncreases (or decreases) by 3 miles per hour \nper round until the maximum (or minimum) \nspeed is attained. The caster, with one \nround of complete concentration, can stabi- \nlize the wind at its current strength, or set it \nto increase or decrease, althoGgh the rate of \nthe change cannot be altered. The spell re- \nmains in force for one turn for each level of \nexperience of the caster. When the spell is \nexhausted, the force of the wind wanes (or \nwaxes) at the same rate, until it reaches the \nlwel it was at before the spell took effect. \nAnother caster can use a control winds spell \nto counter the effects of a like spell up to the \nlimits of his own ability. \nCure Critical Wounds (Necmmpncy) \nReversible \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe cure m*ticd wounds spell is a very \npotent version of the cure light wounds \nspell. The priest lays his hand upon a crea- \nture and heals 3d8+3 points of damage \nfrom wounds or other damage. The spell \ndoes not affect creatures without corporeal \nbodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those \nnot living. \nThe reversed spell, cuuse critical wounds, \noperates in the same fashion as other cuuse \nwounds spells, requiring a successful touch \nto inflict the 3d8+3 points of damage. \nCaused wounds heal via the same mtfrods \nas do wounds of other sorts. \nDispel Evil (Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Protection, Summoning \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/lwel \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe priest using this spell causes a sum- \nmoned creatude of wil nature, an evil crea- \nture from another plane, or a creature \nsummoned by an evil caster, to return to its \nown plane or place when the caster success- \nfully strikes it in melee combat. (Examples \nof such creatures are aerial servants, djinn, \nefreet, elementals, and invisible stalkers.) \nAn evil etlchantment (such as a chum spell \ncast by an evil creature) that is subject to a \nnormal dispel magic spell can be automati- \ncally dispelled by the dispel mil spell. Note \nthat this spell lasts for a maximum of one \nround for pach experience level of the caster, \nor until expended. While the spell is in ef- \nfect, all creatures that could be affected by it \nattack with a -7 penalty to their attack \nrolls when engaghg the spellcaster. \n222"
