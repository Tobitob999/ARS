    "text": "Races (Halflings) I \nHalflings \nHalflings are short, \ngenerally plump people, very much like \nsmall humans. Their faces are round and \nbroad and often quite florid. Their hair is \ntypically curly and the tops of their feet are \ncovered with coarse hair. They prefer not to \nwear shoes whenever possible. Their typical \nlife expectancy is approximately 150 years. \nHalflings are sturdy and industrious, gen- \nerally quiet and peaceful. Overall they pre- \nfer the comforts of home to dangerous \nadventuring. They enjoy good living, rough \nhumor, and homespun stories. In fact, they \ncan be a trifle boring at times. Halflings are \nnot forward, but they are observant and \nconversational if in friendly company. Half- \nlings see wealth only as a means of gaining \ncreature comforts, which they love. Though \nthey are not overly brave or ambitious, they \nare generally honest and hard working \nwhen there is need. \nHalfling homes are well-furnished bur- \nrows, although most of their work is done \non the surface. Elves generally like them in a \npatronizing sort of way. Dwarves cheerfully \ntolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat \nsoft and harmless. Gnomes, although they \ndrink more and eat less, like halflings best, \nfeeling them kindred spirits. Because half- \nlings are more open and outgoing than any \nof these other three, they get along with oth- \ner races far better. \nThere are three types of halflings: Hair- \nfeets, Tallfellows, and Stouts. Hairfeets are \nthe most common type, but for player char- \nacters, any of the three is acceptable. \nA halfling character can choose to be a \ncleric, fighter, thief, or a multi-class fighter/ \nthief. The halfling must use the rules provid- \ned for multislass characters. \nThrough their contact with other races, \nhalfling characters are allowed to choose \ninitial languages from common, halfling, \ndwarf, elf, gnome, goblin, and orc, in addi- \ntion to any other languages the DM allows. \nThe actual number of languages the charac- \nter knows is limited by his Intelligence (see \nTable 4) or by the number of proficiency \nslots he allots to languages (if that optional \nsystem is used). \nAll halfling characters have a high resist- \nance to magical spells, so for every 3% \npoints of Constitution score, the character \ngains a +1 bonus on saving throws vs. \nwands, staves, rods, and spells. These \nbonuses are summarized on Table 9. \nHalflings have a similar resistance to poi- \nsons of all sorts, so they gain a Constitution \nbonus identical to that for saving throws vs. \nmagical attacks when they make saving \nthrows vs. poison (i.e., +1 to +5, depend- \ning on Constitution score). \nHalflings have a natural talent with slings \nand thrown weapons. Rock pitching is a \nfavorite sport of many a halfling child. All \nhalflings gain a +1 bonus to their attack \nrolls when using thrown weapons and \nslings. \nA halfling can gain a bonus to surprise \nopponents, but only if the halfling is not in \nmetal armor. Even then, the halfling must \neither be alone, or with a party comprised \nonly of halflings or elves, or 90 feet or more \naway from his party to gain this bonus. If he \nfulfills any of these conditions, he causes a \n- 4 penalty to opponents' surprise rolls. If a \ndoor or other screen must be opened, this \npenalty is reduced to -2. \nDepending on their lineage, certain half- \nling characters have infravision. Any half- \nling character has a 15 percent chance to \nhave normal infravision (this means he is \npure Stout), out to 60 feet; failing that \nchance, there is a 25 percent chance that he \nhas limited infravision (mixed Stout/ \nTallfellow or Stout/Hairfeets lineage), effec- \ntive out to 30 feet. \nSimilarly, halflings with any Stoutish \nblood can note if a passage is an up or down \ngrade with 75 percent accuracy (roll a 1, 2, \nor 3 on ld4). They can determine direction \nhalf the time (roll a 1,2, or 3 on ld6). These \nabilities function only when the character is \nconcentrating on the desired information to \nthe exclusion of all else, and only if the char- \nacter is pure or partially Stout. \nHalfling characters have a penalty of - 1 \nto their initially generated Strength scores, \nand they gain a bonus of + 1 to Dexterity. \nHumans \nAlthough humans \nare treated as a single race in the AD&D@ \ngame, they come in all the varieties we \nknow on Earth. A human PC can have \nwhatever racial characteristics the DM \nallows. \nHumans have only one special ability: \nThey can be of any character class and rise \nto any level in any class. Other PC races \nhave limited choices in these areas. \nHumans are also more social and tolerant \nthan most other races, accepting the compa- \nny of elves, dwarves, and the like with \nnoticeably less complaint. \nBecause of these abilities and tendencies, \nhumans have become significant powers \nwithin the world and often rule empires that \nother races (because of their racial tenden- \ncies) would find difficult to manage. \nOther Characteristics \nAfter you have \nselected a race, you may want to fill in the \ndetails of your character. You are not \nrequired to do so, but there are many situa- \ntions in which this information is vital or \nuseful to role-playing. \nThe sex and name of your character are \nup to you. Your character can be of the same \nsex as yourself or of the opposite sex. \nSome people feel it is important to know \nwhether their character is right- or left- \nhanded. Actually, this has no bearing on the \nplay of the game, since all characters are \nassumed to be reasonably competent with \neither hand (that doesn't mean everyone is \ntrained to fight with two weapons). It is easiest \nto say that your character has the same hand- \nedness as you. This will result in the normal \nratio of right- to left-handed people. \nOn occasion it may be useful to know \nyour character's height and weight. The best \nway to determine height and weight is to \nchoose the appropriate numbers, subject to \nyour DMs approval. If you want a short, \npudgy human fighter, you can select an \nappropriate height and weight. Otherwise, \nheights and weights can be generated ran- \ndomly using Table 10 (next page). Take the \nappropriate base score and add the die roll \nmodifier. As with all tables, this can create \nsome ridiculous results (one of the problems \nwith randomness) and, at the same time, \ncannot account for the full variety of man- \nkind (or demihumankind). The table only \nreproduces a fairly average range for each \nrace. Heizhts and weidits for demihuman \nraces not hed on the Gble must be dec \nby your DM. \n8 feet 1.2 \nonly 26.5 inches tall and the shortest \nwoman bettered this at only 24 inches in \nheight. While the lightest humans are \nalso among the shortest, the heaviest \nPlayers may also want to know their \ncharacters' starting ages. Human characters \ncan start at any age that is agreeable to both \nthe player and the DM. However, all begin- \nning adventurers are assumed to be at least \n16 years old, since they must grow physi- \ncally, emotionally, and in practical experi- \nence before they are ready to undertake the \nrigors of an adventuring life. Table 11 can be \nused to give a starting age (add the variable \ndie roll to the base starting age to get the \ncharacter's starting age) and the possible life \nspan of a character, assuming a quiet and \npeaceful life. Humans are also included on \nthis list in case you want to determine their \nages randomly. The maximum age for a \ncharacter should be secretly determined and \nrecorded by the DM. Player characters may \nhave an idea of how long they expect to live, \nbut do not know their true allotted life \nspans."
