    "text": "Domination (EhchantmenVCharm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 person \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe domination spell enables the caster to \ncontrol the actions of any person until the \nspell is ended by the subject's Intelligence \n(see the charm person spell). Elves and half- \nelves resist this enchantment as they do all \ncharm-type spells. When the spell is cast, \nthe subject must roll a saving throw vs. spell \nat a penalty of -2, but Wisdom adjust- \nments apply. Failure means the wizard has \nestablished a telepathic link with the sub- \nject's mind. If a common language is shared, \nthe wizard can generally force the subject to \nperform as the wizard desires, within the \nlimits of the subject's body structure and \nStrength. Note that the caster does not re- \nceive direct sensory input from the subject. \nSubjects resist this control, and those \nforced to take actions against their natures \nreceive a new saving throw with a bonus of \n+ 1 to + 4, depending on the type of action \nrequired. Obviously selfdestructive orders \nare not carried out. Once control is estab- \nlished, there is no limit to the range at which \nit can be exercised, as long as the caster and \nsubject are on the same plane. \nA protection from evil spell can prevent \nthe caster from exercising control or using \nthe telepathic link while the subject is so \nwarded, but it cannot prevent the establish- \nment of domination. \nDream (Invocation, IllusiodPhantasm) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration Spefial \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creatu \nSaving Throw: None \nThe dream spell enables the caster, or a \nmessenger touched by the caster, to send \nmessages to others in the form of dreams. At \nthe beginning of the spell, the caster must \nname the recipient or identify him by some \ntitle that leaves no doubt as to his identity. \nAs the caster completes the spell, the per- \nson sending the spell falls into a deep trance- \nlike sleep, and instantaneously projects his \nmind to the recipient. The sender then en- \nters the recipient's dream and delivers the \nmessage unless the recipient is magically \nprotected. If the recipient is awake, the mes- \nsage sender can choose to remain in the \ntrancelike sleep. If the sender is disturbed \nduring this time, the spell is immediately \ncancelled and the sender comes out of the \ntrance. The whereabouts and current activi- \nties of the recipient cannot be learned \nthrough this spell. \nThe sender is unaware of his own sur- \nroundings or the activities around him while \nhe is in his trance. He is totally defenseless, \nboth physically and mentally (i.e., he al- \nways fails any saving throw) while in the \ntrance. \nOnce the recipient's dreams are entered, \nthe sender can deliver a message of any \nlength, which the recipient remembers per- \nfectly upon waking. The communication is \none-way, the recipient cannot ask questions \nor offer information. Nor can the sender \ngain any information by observing the \ndreams of the recipient. Once the message is \ndelivered, the sender's mind returns in- \nstantly to his body. The duration of the spell \nis the time required for the sender to enter \nthe recipient's dream and deliver the mes- \nsage. \nThe reverse of this spell, nightmare, en- \nables the caster to send a hideous and unset- \ntling vision to the recipient, who is allowed \na saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. \nThe nightmare prevents restful sleep and \ncauses Id10 hit points of damage. The \nnightmare leaves the recipient fatigued and \nunable to regain spells for the next day. A \ndispel evil spell cast upon the recipient stuns \nthe caster of the nightmare for one turn per \nlevel of the cleric countering this evil send- \ning. \nExtension II (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is the same as the 4th-level ex- \ntension I spell, except it extends the duration \nof 1st- through 4th-level spells by 50%. \nFabricate (Enchantment, Alteration) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic yd./level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto convert material of one sort into a \nproduct that is of the same material. Thus \nthe spellcaster can fabricate a wooden \nbridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a \npatch of hemp, clothes from flax or wool, \nand so forth. Magical or living thw can- \nnot be created or altered by a fabricate spell. \nThe quality of items made by this spell is \ncommensurate with the quality of material \nused as the basis for the new fabrication. If a \n168 \nmineral is worked with, the area of effect is \nreduced by a factor of 27-one cubic foot \nper level instead of one cubic yard. \nArticles requiring a high degree of crafts- \nmanship (jewelry, swords, glass, crystal, \netc.) cannot be fabricated unless the wizard \notherwise has great skill in the appropriate \ncraft. \nCasting requires one full round per cubic \nyard (or foot) or material to be affected by \nthe spell. \nFalse Vision (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: %foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto confound any attempt to scry (by means I \nof either a spell or a magical device) any I \npoint within the area of effect of the spell. To \nuse the spell, he must be aware of the scry- . \ning attempt, although knowledge of the 4 \nscryer or the sayer's location is not n- \nsary. Upon casting the spell, the caster and \nall he desires within the radius of the spell \nbecome undetectable to the suying. Fur- \nthermore, the caster is able to send what- \never message he desires, including vision \nand sound, according to the medium of the \nscrying method. To do this, the caster must \nconcentrate op the message he is sending. \nOnce concentration is broken, no further \nimages can be sent, although the caster re- \nmains undetectable for the duration of the \nSpell. \nThe material component for this spell is \nthe ground dust of an emerald worth at least \n500 gp, which is sprinkled into the air when \nthe spell is cast. \nFeeblemind (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is used solely against people or \ncreatures who use magic spells. Feeblemind \ncauses the subject's intellect to degrwate to \nthat of a moronic child. The subject remains \nin this state until a heal or wish spell is used \nto cancel the effects. Magic-using beings are \nvery vulnerable to this spell, thus their sav- \ning throwesuffer the following penalties: \nSaving Throw \nSpell Use of Target Adjustment \nPriest +1 \nWizard (human) -4 \nCombination or nonhuman -2"
