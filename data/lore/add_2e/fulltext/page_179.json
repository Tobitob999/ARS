The ward protects a one-storey stronghold, \nwith a base dimension of 400‘ X 400’. The \nwizard can ward a multi-storey area by \nreducing the base area proportionately. The \nfollowing take place in the warded area \nupon casing of the spell: \n1. All corridors become misty, and visibil- \nity is reduced to 10 feet. \n2. All doors are wizard locked. \n3. Stairs are filled with webs from top to \nbottom. These act as the 2nd-level web \nspell, except that they regrow within one \nturn if destroyed. \n4. Where there are choices in direction- \nsuch as a cross or side passage-a minor \nconfusion-type spell functions so as to \nmake it 50% probable that intruders \nbelieve they are going in the exact oppo- \nsite direction. \n5. The whole area radiates magic. The nor- \nmal use of the detect magic spell becomes \nimpossible for those of less than the cast- \ner’s level and difficult for others. \n6. One door per level of experience of the \nwizard is covered by an illusion to \nappear as if it were a plain wall. \n7. The wizard can place one of the follow- \ning additional magical effects: \nA. Dancing fights in four corridors \nB. Magic mouth in two places \nC. Stinking cloud in two places \nD. Gust of wind in one corridor or room \nE. Suggestion in one place. \nNote that items 6 and 7 function only \nwhen the wizard is totally familiar with the \narea of the spell’s effect. &pel magic can \nremove one effect, at random, per casting. \nA remove curse spell will not work. \nThe material components of the spell are \nburning incense, a small measure of sulphur \nand oil, a knotted string, a small amount of \number hulk blood, and a small silver rod. \nA \nA \nInvisible Stalker \n(Conjur~tio@arnmoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell summons an invisible stalker \nfrom the elemental plane of Air. This 8 Hit \nDice monster obeys and serves the spellcast- \ner in performing whatever tasks are set \nbefore it. It is a faultless tracker within one \nday of the quarry’s passing. The invisible \nstalker follows instructions even if they send \nhim hundreds ‘or thousands of miles away \nand, once given an order, follows through \nunceasingly until the task is accomplished. \nHowever, the creature is bound to serve; it \ndoes not do so from loyalty or desire. \nTherefore, it resents prolonged missions or \ncomplex tasks, and it attempts to pervert \ninstructions accordingly. Invisible stalkers \nunderstand common speech but speak no \nlanguage save their own. \nThe material components of this spell are \nburning incense and a piece of horn carved \ninto a crescent shape. \nLegend Lore (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe legend lore spell is used to determine \nlegendary information regarding a known \nperson, place, or thing. If the person or \nthing is at hand, or if the wizard is in the \nplace in question, the likelihood of the spell \nproducing results is far greater and the cast- \ning time is only ld4 turns. If only detailed \ninformation on the person, place, or thing is \nknown, casting time is Idlo days. If only \nrumors are known, casting time is 2d6 \nWeeks. \nDuring the casting, the wizard cannot \nengage in activities other than the routine: \neating, sleeping, etc. When completed, the \ndivination reveals if legendary material is \navailable. It often reveals where this materi- \nal is-by place name, rhyme, or riddle. It \nsometimes gives certain information regard- \ning the person, place, or thing (when the \nobject of the fegend fore is at hand), but this \ndata is always in some cryptic form (rhyme, \nriddle, anagram, cipher, sign, etc.). \nThe spell is cast with incense and strips of \nivory formed into a rectangle, but some \nitem of value to the caster must be sacrificed \nin addition-a potion, magical scroll, magi- \ncal item, etc. \nNaturally, legend fore reveals informa- \ntion only if the person, place, or thing is \nnoteworthy or legendary. \nSuppose Delsenora came across an \nextremely well-made sword. It radiates \nmagic, but when she used an identify spell, \nshe could not leam any information. Even \ngiving it to a trusted fighter didn’t work as \nthe sword did not reveal any special \npowers. Finally, she casts a legend lore spell, \nhoping to gain more hformation. Since the \nsword is at hand, she completes the spell in \nthree turn. In her mind comes the message, \n”Once this was the sword of he who waits \ntill Albion‘s time of greatest peril, when \nunto his hand it shall fly again. Fair was the \nhand that gave me and fair was the hand \nthat reclaimed me.” Clearly, Delsenora rcaE \nizes, this must be a very powerful item, \nsince her spell gave only a cryptic answer. \nBut who is he who waits? And where is \nAlbion? For more information, Delsenora is \ngoing to have to cast more spells. But now \nthe process will take quch longer, since she \nhas only the vaguest of clues to follow. \nLower Water (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 tum \nArea of Effect: 10-foot square arealleve1 \nSaving Throw: None \nThe wizard casting a low water spell \ncad water or similar fluid in the area of \neffect to sink away. The water can be krwered \nup to two feet for every experience kvcl of \nthe wizard, to a minimum depth of one inch. \nThe water is lowered within a square area \nwhose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. \nThus, a 12th-level wizard affects a volume \n24’ x 120’ x m’, a 13th-levd casta a vol- \nume of 26’ X 130‘ X la’, and so on. In \nextremely large and deep bodies of water, \nsuch as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl- \npool that sweeps ships and similar aaft \ndownward, putting them at risk and render- \ning them unable to leave by normal mom- \nment for the duration of the spell.’b cast \non water dement;lEs and other water-based \ncreatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: the \ncreature moves at half speed and +half \nthe number of attacks each round. It has no \neffect on other creatures. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall vial of dust. \nIts reverse, raise water, causes water or \nsimilar fluids to return to their highest natu- \nral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This \ncan make fords impassable, float grounded \nships, and may even sweep away bridges at \nthe referee‘s option. It negates lower wuter \nand vice versa. \nThe material component of the raise \nwater spell is a small vial of water."
