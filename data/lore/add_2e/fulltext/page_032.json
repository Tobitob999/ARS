    "text": ", A spell book contains the complicated \ninstructions for casting the spell-the spews \nvecipe, so to speak. Merely reading these \ninstructions aloud or trying to mimic the \ninstructions does not enable one to cast the \nspell. Spells gather and shape mystical ener- \ngies; the procedures involved are very \ndemanding, bizarre, and intricate. Before a \nwizard can actually cast a spell, he must \nmemorize its arcane formula. This locks an \nenergy pattern for that particular spell into \nhis mind. Once he has the spell memorized, \nit remains in his memory until he uses the \nexact combination of gestures, words, and \nmaterials that triggem the release of this \n_gnergy pattern. Upon casting, the energy of \nthe spell is spent, wiped clean from the wiz- \nard's mind. The wizard cannot cast that \nspell again until he returns to his spell book \nand memorizes it again. \nInitially the wizard is able to retain only a \nfew of these magical energiesinhismind at \none time. Furthermore, some spells are \nmore demanding and complex than others; \nthese are impossible for the inexperienced \nwizard to memorize. With experience, the \nwizard's talent expands. He can memorize \nmore spells and more complex spells. Still, \nhe never escapta his need to study; the wiz- \nard must always return to his spell books to \nrefresh his powers. \nAnother important power of the wizard is \nhis ability to research new spells and con- \nstruct magical items. Both endeavors are \ndifficult, time-consuming, costly, occasion- \nally even perilous. Through research, a wiz- \nard can create an entirely new spell, subject \nto the DM's approval. Likewise, by consult- \ning with your DM, your character can build \nmagical items, either similar to those \nalready given in the rules or of your own \ndesign.

This is both an \nadvantage and a disadvantage. On the posi- \ntive side, the mage's selection pf spells \nenables him to qeal with many different sit- \nuations. Wizards who study within a single \nschool of magic learn highly specialized \nspells, but at the expense of spells from oth- \ner areas.)

Each school has its own special \nmethods and practices. \nof magic are not organized places where a \nperson goes to study. The word \"school\" \nidentifies a magical discipline. A school is \nan approach to magic and spellcasting that \nemphasizes a particular sort of spell. Practi- \ntioners of a school of magic may set up a \nmagical university to teach their methods to \nbeginners, but this is not necessary. Many \npowerful wizards learned their craft study- \ning under reclusive masters in distant lands. \nThe nine schools of magic are Abjuration, \nAlteration, ConjuratiodSummo- En- \nchantmenKharm, Greater Divination, Nu- \nsion, Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy, \nAlthough they are called schools, schools \nand Lesser Divination. \nIllusi \n' /Enchant. /Charm Alteration-- \nGreater Div. --+&--- Coni ./Summ. \nInvoc./Evoc. ,' ' ' I %--Abjuration \nNecromancy \n-* I / \nThis diagram illustrates the schools that \noppose each other. See Table 22 and its entry \ndescriptions for more information. \nwhile the ninth, lesser divination, is a minor \nschool. The minor school of lesser divina- \ntion includes all divination spells of the 4th \nspell level or less (available to all wizards). \nGreater divinations are those divination \nspells of the 5th spell level or higher. \nSpecialist Wizards \nA wizard who concentrates his &ort iu a \nsingle school of magic is called a sped&&. \nThere are specialists in each type of magic, \nalthough some are extremely rare. Not all \nspecialists are well-suited to adventuring- \nthe diviner's spells are limited and not -- \nally useful in dangerous situations. On the \nother hand, player characters watt to \nconsult an NPC diviner More stcu2h\\$ an \nadventure. \nSpecialist wizards have advan- a~ \ndisadvantages when compared to mages. \nTheir chance to know spells of their school \nof magic is greatly increased, but the inten- \nsive study results in a smallcl dwce to \nknow spells outside their school. The nm \nber of spells they can cast increases, but they \nlose the ability to cast spells of the school in \nopposition to their specialty (opposite it in \nthe diagram). Their ability to research and \ncreate new spells within their specialty is \nincreased, but the initial selection of spells \nin their school may be quite limited. All in \nall, players must cdder the advantaws \nand disadvantages carefully. \nNot all wizards can become specialists. \nThe player character must meet certain \nrequirements to become a specialist. Most \nspecialist wizards must be single-classed; \nmulti-classed characters cannot become \nspecialists, except for gnomes, who seem to \nhave more of a natural bent for the school of \nillusion than characters of any other race. \nDualclass humens can choose to become \nspecialists. The dedication to the particular \nschool of magic requires all the attention \nand concentration of the character.
