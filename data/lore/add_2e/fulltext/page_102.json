For \nthis reason, the saving throw categories in \nTable 60 are listed in order of importance, \nbeginning with paralyzation, poison, and \ndeath magic, and ending with spells. \nImagine that Rath is struck by the ray \nfrom a wand of polymorphing. Both a sav- \ning throw vs. wands and a saving throw vs. \npolymorph would be appropriate. But Rath \nmust roll a saving throw vs. wands because \nthat category has a higher priority than \npolymorph. \nThe categories of saving throws are as fol- \nlows: \nSave vs. Paralyzation, Poison, and Death \nMagic: This is used whenever a character is \naffected by a paralyzing attack (regardless \nof source), poison (of any strength), or cer- \ntain spelIs and magical items that otherwise \nkill the character outright (as listed in their \ndescriptions). This saving throw can also be \nused in situations in which exceptional force \nof will or physical fortitude are needed. \nSave vs. Rod, Staff, or Wand As its name \nimplies, this is used whenever a character is \naffected by the powers of a rod, staff, or \nwand, provided another save of higher pri- \nority isn’t called for. This saving throw is \nsometimes specified for situations in which \na character faces a magical attack from an \nunusual source. \nSave vs. Petrification or Polymorph: This \nis used any time a character is turned to \nstone (petrified) or polymorphed by a mon- \nster, spell, or magical item (other than a \nwand). It can also be used when the charac- \nter must withstand some massive physical \nalteration of his entire body. \nSave vs. Breath Weapon: A character uses \nthis save when facing monsters with breath \nweapons, particularly the powerful blast of \na dragon. This save can also be used in situ- \nations where a combination of physical \nstamina and Dexterity are critical factors in \nsurvival. \nSave vs. Spell: This is used whenever a \ncharacter attempts to resist the effects of a \nmagical attack, either by a spellcaster or \nfrom a magical item, provided no other type \n101 \nof saving throw is specified. This save can \nalso be used to resist an attack that defies \nany other classification. \nI \nVoluntarily Failing Savlng Throws \nNo save is made tf \nthe target voluntarily chooses not to resist \nthe effect of a spell or special attack. This is \nthe case even if the character was duped as \nto the exact nature of the spell. When a char- \nacter announces that he is not resisting the \nspell’s power, that spell (or whatever) hasits \nfull effect. \nThe intention not to resist must be clearly \nstated or set up through trickery, howewr. \nIf a character is attacked by surprise or \ncaught unawares, he is normally allowed a \nsaving throw. The DM can modify this sav- \ning throw, making the chance of swxess \nworse, if the situation warrants it. Only in \nextreme cases of trickery and deception \nshould an unwitting character be dmitd a \nsaving throw. \nAbility Checks as slvlng Throws \nWhen a characker \nattempts to avoid danger through thruse of \none of his abilities, an ability check cart be \nused in lieu of a saving throw. \nFor example, Ragnar the thief has broken \ninto someone’s home when he hears a gat- \ning noise from the ceiling above him. Me \nlooks up to find a five-ton block of &e ceil- \ning headed straight for him! He is gokrg to \nneed speedy reactions to get out of the way, \nso a Dexterity ability ch& should be mM \nto see if he avoids the trap. \nModifying Savlng Throws \nSaving throws can \nbe modified by magical item, specific ruks, \nand special situations. These modifiers can \nincrease or decrease the chance of a fucfcs& \nful saving throw. \nModifiers that increase the chance are \ngiven as a number preceded by a plus sign. \nModifiers that make success more diffirult \nare given as a number preceded by a minus \nsign (-1, -2, etc.). \nSaving throw modi€iers affect a hrac- \nter’s die roll, not the saving .throw number \nneeded. Thus, if Delsenora needed an 11 for \na successful saving throw vs. petrification \nand had a + 1 bonus to her save, she wdd \nstill need to roll an 11 or higher after all ad- \njustments were made (but the +1 bonus \nwould be added to her die roll, so that effec- \ntively she needs to roll only a 10 on the die \nto reach her saving throw number of 11). \nHigh ability scores in Dexterity and Wis- \ndom sometimes give saving throw bonuses. \nA high Wisdom protects against illusions, \ncharms, and other mental attacks. Dexter- \nity, if high enough, can give a character a \n.- \nI"
