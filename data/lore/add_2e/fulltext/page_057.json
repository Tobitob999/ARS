    "text": "Proficiencies (Nonwenpon Proficiency Descriptions) \ncharacters, having devoted all their energies \nto improving a single proficiency. Likewise, \nold masters normally have more talent than \nyoung apprentices-unless the youth has an \nexceptional ability score! However, age is \nno assurance of talent. Remember that \nknowing a skill and being good at it are two \ndifferent things. There are bad potters, \nmediocre potters, and true craftsmen. All \nthis has much less to do with age than with \ndedication and talent. \n-RofkiencYDcsulptiom \nThe following pro- \nficiency descriptions are arranged alphabet- \nically, not according to character class. Each \ndescription gives a general outline of what a \ncharacter with the proficiency knows and \ncan do. Furthermore, some descriptions \ninclude rules to cover specific uses or situa- \ntions, or exact instructions on the effects of \nthe proficiency. \nAgrlculturp: The character has a knowl- \nedge of the basics of farming. This includes \nplanting, harvesting, storing crsps, tending \nanimals, butchering, and other typical \nfarming chores. \nAncient History: The character has \nlearned the legends, lore, and history of \nsome ancient time and place. The knowl- \nedge must be specific, just as a historian \nwould specialize today in the English Mid- \ndle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or the \nRoman Republic before Caesar. (The DM \neither can have ancient periods in mind for \nhis game or can allow the players to name \nand designate them.) Thus, a player charac- \nter could how details about the Age of \nThorac Dragonking or the Time of the Sea- \nRaiders or whatever else was available. \nThe knowledge acquired gives the hac- \nter familiarity with the principal legends, \nhistorical events, characters, locations, bat- \ntles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and \nmagical), unsolved mysteries, crafts, and \noddities of the time. The character must roll \na Proficiency check to identify places or \nthings he encounters from that age. For \nexample, Rath knows quite a bit about the \nComing of the Trolls, a particularly dark \nperiod of dwwen history. Moving through \nsome deep caverns, he and his companions \nstumble across an ancient portal, sealed for \nuntold ages. Studying the handiwork, he \nrealizes (rolls a successfd proficiency check) \nthat it bears several seals similar to those he \nhas seen on \"banned\" portals from the time \nof Angnar, doorways to the legendary \nrealm of Trolhel. \nAnimal Handling Proficiency in this area \nenables a character to exercise a greater- \nthan-normal degree of control over pack \nanimals and beasts of burden. A successful \nproficiency check indicates that the charac- \nter has succeeded in calming an excited or \n, \nY \n\\ \nagitated animal; in contrast, a character \nwithout this proficiency has only a 20% \nchance of succeeding in the attempt. \nAnimal Lore: This proficiency enables a \ncharacter to observe the actions or habitat \nof an animal and interpret what is going on. \nActions can show how dangerous the crea- \nture is, whether it is hungry, protecting its \nyoung, or defending a nearby den. Further \nmore, careful observation of sbs and \nbehaviors can even indicate thc location of a \nwater hole, animal herd, predator, or \nimpending danger, such as a forest fin. The \nDM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A \nsuccessful check means the character under- \nstood the basic actions of the creature. If the \ncheck fails by 4 or less, no information is \ngained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the \ncharacter misinterprets the actions of the \nanimal. \nA character may also imitate the caIls and \ncries of animals that he is reasonably familiar \nwith, based on his badrground. This ability \nis limited by volume. The roar of a tyranno- \nsaurus rex would be beyond the abilities of a \nnormal character. A succtsafd proficiency \ncheck means that onky magical means can \ndis- the character's call from that of \nthe true anima. The cry is sufficient to fool \nanimals, perhaps frightening them away or \nluringthem closer. Afailedchdmeansthe \nsound is incorrect in some slight way. A \nfailed call may still fool some listeners, but \navaturesvexyfamiliarwiththeayautomat- \nically detect a false call. AU other creatures \nandcharactem are alld a Widom cheek \nto detect the fake. \nFinally, animal lore increases the chance \nof sucay setting snares and traps (for \nhunting) since the Charaacrh the gen- \neral habits of the creature kted. \nAninul TnMne: Characters with this \nproficiency can train one type of avatum \n(declared when the proficiency is chm) to \nobey simple commands and perfonn tricks. \nA character can spend additional pmficien- \ncis to train other types of crutures or can \nimprove his skill with an already chosen \ntype. Creatures typically trained are dogs, \nhorses, falcons, pigeons, elephants, ferrets, \nand parrots. A character can choose even \nmore exotic creatures and monsters with \ncult to control). \nA trainer can woik with up to three crea- \ntures at one time. The trainer may choose to \nteach general tasks or specific tricks. A gen- \neral task gives the creature the ability to \nreact to a number of nonqxdic commands \nto do its job. Examples of tasks include \nanimal intelligew (dthough these are diffi-"
