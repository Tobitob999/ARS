    "text": "Hidden out there in the campaign world are \ngreat treasures awaiting discovery. Andent \ndragons rest on huge hordes of gold, silver, \nand gems. Orc chieftains greedily garner the \nloot from the latest raid. Mindless jellies \nooze through the bones and armor of unfor- \ntunate souls. Foul lords of darkness cun- \nningly leave small fortunes apparently \nunguarded, like spiders luring in the flies. \nStooped wizards assemble shelves of arcane \nmagical items. Some treasures, like those of \ndragons, are gathered and horded for rea- \nsons fully understood only by their collec- \ntors. Others are gathered for more mundane \nrare few troves date From eons before, their \nowners long dead and forgotten. Some trea- \nsure hordes are small, such as the pickings \nof a yellow mold. Others are enormous, \nsuch as the Tyrant King's treasury. Trea- \nsures may be free for the taking or fiercely \ntrapped and watched over. \npurpoge~--po~er, l~rmry, and security. A \nTreasure Types \nTreasure comes in \nmany different forms and sizes, ranging \nfrom the mdane to the exotic. There are \nof course coins of copper, silver, gold, elec- \ntrum, and platinum. But precious metals \ncan also be shaped into gilded cups, etched \nbowls, or even silverware. Characters know \nthe value of coins and will have no difficulty \nestablishing their worth in most cases. How- \never, ancient treasure hordes may contain \ncoins no 1- used. It may be that these \ncan be sold only by their weight. Objects \nmade of valuable metal are even more diffi- \ncult to appraise. Either the characters must \nfind a goldsmith who can value the item and \na buyer willing to pay a fair price, or these \ntoo must be melted down for their metal. In \nlarge cities this is not too difficult. There are \nalways appraisers and fences handy, \nalthough getting full value might be diffi- \ncult. (Acarsations of theft are another small \nently valuable bowl dd actually be base \nmetal plated in silver. The metal of coins \ncould be debased with copper or brass. \nWeights couM be rigged to give false prices. \nCharacters must find merchants they can \ntrust. \nGems are attother common form of trea- \nsure and here player characters are even \nmore depmdent on others. Unless the party \nhas a skilled appraiser of precious stones, \nthey're going to have to trust others. After \nall, those red stones they found in the last \ntreasure could be cheap glass, richly colored \nbut only marginally valuable quartz, semi- \nprecious garnets, or valuable rubies. Again, \nthe player characters are going to have to \nfind a jeweler they can trust and be watchful \nfor cheats and scams. However, truly tricky \nDMs minhs Dresent your characters with \nuncut gems. These are almost impossible for \nthe untrained eye to spot or appraise. Most \ncharacters (and most players) are not going \nto realize that a piece of unremarkable stone \ncan be a valuable gem when properly cut. \nPerhaps the most difficult of all treasure \nitems to appraise are objects of artistic val- \nue. While gems cut or uncut are valuable, \ntheir worth can be greatly increased when \nused in a piece of jewelry. Gold is valuable \nby weight, but even more 80 when fash- \nioned into a cup or pin. Dwarven craftsmen \nfrom hidden communities practice the finest \narts of gem-cutting, while gnomish artisans \nin earthen burrows labor away on elaborate \ngold and silver filigrees. Ancient elven carv- \nings, done in exquisitely grained woods, \nstand side by side with the purest of statues \nchineled by man. All of these have a value \nthat goes far beyond their mere materials. \nBut artistic creations seldom have a fixed \nvalue. Their price depends on the player \ncharacters fink a buyer and that person's \nwillingnem to buy. A few large cities may \nhave brokers in arts, merchants who know \nthe right people and are willing to act as go- \nbetweens. Most of the time, however, the \nplayer characters have to go to the effort of \npeddling their wares personally. This \nrequires tact and delicacy, for such items are \nseldom bought by any but the wealthy and \nthe wealthy often do not like stooping to \nbusiness negotiations. Player characters \nmust carefully avoid giving insult to the \nbarons, dukes, counts, and princes they \nmight deal with. \nFinally, there are the truly Yd things \nyour character un find--furs, exotic ani- \nmals, spices, rare spell components, or even \ntrade goods. As with art Objects, the vh \nof these items are highly subjective. Erst the \nplayer characters have to find a buyer. This \nis not too difficult for everyday things, such \nas furs or trade goods, but it can be a tre- \nmendous enterprise if you have a spell com- \nponent that is usdcll only to the most \npowerful of wizards. Next the PCs must \nhaggle about the price. Eurrieft and mer- \nchants do this as a matter of course. - \nhasgte because they hope the PCs do not \nknow the true valw of what they hold or \nbecause they themselves do not know. After \nall this, the PCs might be able to dl their \ngoods. However, if you enter into this in the \ntrue spirit of role-playing and see it as part \nof the adventure, the whole process is \nenjoyable. \nMagical Items \nThetreasure8men- \ntioned thus far are all monetary. Their use- \nfulness is immediate and obvious. They give \ncharacters wealth, and with wealth comes \npower and influence. However, there are \nother treasures, very desirable ones, that \nyour characters will not want to sell or give \n77 \naway. These are the magical items that your \ncharacters find and use. \nAlthough priests and wizards can make \nmagical items (according to the gakklhs \nyour DM has for magical nseuch), it is far \nmore common for charmem to find these \nitemsduringthecourseofadvmturrs.~- \nical items are powerful aids for charactas. \nWith them, characters can gain bonuses m \ncombat, cast spells with the mere uHrrantc \nof a word, withstand the fiercest fire, and \nperform feats impossible by any otkr \nknown means. Not all magical items are \nbenefiaal, however. Some are cursed. the \nresult of faulty magical construction or, \nvery rarely, the deliberate handiwork of \nsome truly mad or evil wizard. \nare many differen \nyour character can find, but they all fa \na few basic categories. Each type of magical \nitem has pmperties you shouki be ware of. \nMa@d Wkaponr There can be a magi- \ncal version of nearly any type of normal \nweapon, although there are admittedly few \nmagical bardiches or guisanne-voulges. By \nfar the most common magical weapons are \nswords and daggers. A magical weapon typ- \nically gives a + 1 or greater bonus to attack \nrob, increasing a character's chance to hit \nand cause damage. Perhaps magical swords \nare quicker on the attack, or maybe they're \nsharper than normal steel-the explanation \ncan be whatever the DM desires. Whatever \nthe reason, magical weapons give dts far \nbeyond those of even the hesr-craftgd non- \nmagical blade. \nA rare few weapons have even greater \nPO-. These may allow your character to \nsense danger, heal wounds, float in mid-air, \nor have the most amazing luck. The rarest \nof the rare' can actually communicate with \nyour character and are imbued with an \nother-worldly intelligence. While the most \npowerful of magical weapons, these clever \ninstruments of destruction sometimes seek \nto impose their wills on their owners. \nWhen you find a magical weapon, more \nthan likely you do not know its properties. \nSome functions, such as the advantage it \ngives you in combat, can be learned by trial \nand error. Other properties must be learned \nthrough research and spells. Ancient histo- \nries and legend lore spells can provide infor- \nmation on the properties of your weapon. \nOn rare occasions, properties are discov- \nered through blind luck. Simply command- \ning the weapon to activate one power after \nanother (hoping it will suddenly spring to \nlife) works only for the most minor \nrbilities--detecting danger, opottins secret \nI"
