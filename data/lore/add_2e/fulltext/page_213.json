The neg- \native plane protection spell opens a channel \nto the Positive Material plane, possibly off- \nsetting the effect of the negative energy \nattack. A protected creature struck by a \nnegative energy attack is allowed a saving \nthrow vs. death magic. If successful, the \nenergies cancel with a bright flash of light \nand a thunderclap. The protected creature \nsuffers only normal hit point damage from \nthe attack and does not suffer any drain of \nexperience or Strength, regardless of the \nnumber of levels the attack would have \ndrained. An attacking undead creature suf- \nfers 2d6 points of damage from the Positive \nplane energy; a draining wizard or weapon \nreceives no damage. \nThis protection is proof against only one \nsuch attack, dissipating immediately wheth- \ner or not the saving throw was successful. If \nthe saving throw is failed, the spell recipient \nsuffers double the usual physical damage, in \naddition to the loss of experience or \nStrength that normally occurs. The protec- \ntion lasts for one turn per level of the priest \ncasting the spell, or until the protected crea- \nture is struck by a negative energy attack. \nThis spell cannot be cast on the Negative \nMaterial plane. \nPlilnt Growth (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 160 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe plant growth spell enables the caster \nto choose either of two different uses. The \nfirst causes normal vegetation to grow, \nentwine, and entangle to form a thicket or \njungle that creatures must hack or force a \nway through at a movement rate of 10 feet \nper round (or 20 feet per round for larger- \nthan-man-sized creatures). Note that the \narea must have brush and trees in it in order \nfor this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, \ncreepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, \nthorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so \nthick and overgrown in the area of effect as \nto form a barrier. The area of effect is a \nsquare 20 feet on a side per level of experi- \nence of the caster, in any square or rectangu- \nlar shape that the caster decides upon at the \ntime of the spellcasting. Thus an 8th-level \ncaster can affect a maximum area of 160' \nX 160' square, a 320' X 80' rectangle, a \n640' X 40' rectangle, a 1,280' X 20' rec- \ntangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the \narea until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such \nmagical means as a dispel magic spell. \nThe second use of the spell affects a one- \nmile square area. The DM secretly makes a \nsaving throw (based on the caster's level) to \nsee if the spell takqs effect. If successful, the \nspell renders plants more vigorous, fruitful, \nand hardy, increasing yields by 20% to SO% \n([ld4+1] X lo%), given a normal growing \nseason. The spell does not prevent disaster \nin the form of floods, drought, fire, or \ninsects, although even in these cases the \nplants survive better than expected. This \neffect lasts only for the life cycle of one sea- \nson, the winter \"death marking the end of a \nlife cycle even for the sturdiest of trees. In \nmany farming communities, this spell is \nnormally cast at planting time as part of the \nspring festivals. \nPrayer (Conjuration/Summoning) \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 60-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of the prayer spell, the priest \nbrings special favor upon himself and his \nparty and causes harm to his enemies. \nThose in the area at the instant the spell is \ncompleted are affected for the duration of \nthe spell. When the spell is completed, all \nattack and damage rolls and saving throws \nmade by those in the area of effect who are \nfriendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, \nwhile those of the priest's enemies suffer - 1 \npenalties. Once the prayer spell is uttered, \nthe priest can do other things, unlike a \nchant, which he must continue to make the \nspell effective. If another priest of the same \nreligious persuasion (not merely the same \nalignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast, \nthe effects combine to +2 and -2, as long \nas both are in effect at once. \nThe priest needs a silver holy symbol, \nprayer beads, or a similar device as the \nmaterial component of this spell. \nProtection From Fire (Abjuration) \nSphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe effect of a protection from fire spell \ndiffers according to the recipient of the \nmagic-either the caster or some other crea- \nture. In either case, the spell lasts no longer \nthan one turn per caster level. \n* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers \ncomplete invulnerability to normal fires \n(torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and \nto exposure to magical fires such as fiery \ndragon breath, spells such as burning \nhands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame \nstrike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyro- \nhydra breath, etc., until the spell has \nabsorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage \nper level of the caster, at which time the spell \nis negated. \n* If the spell is cast upon another creature, it \ngives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a \nbonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs. \nfire attacks, and it reduces damage sus- \ntained from magical fires by 50%. \nThe caster's holy symbol is the material \ncomponent. \nPyrotechnics (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 160 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 10 or 100 times \nSaving Throw: Special \nA pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing \nfire source to produce either of two effects, \nat the option of the caster. \n* First, it can produce a flashing and fiery \nburst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks \nthat lasts one round. This effect temporarily \nblinds those creatures in, under, or within \n120 feet of the area that also have an unob- \nstructed line of sight to the effect, for ld4 +1 \nrounds unless the creatures roll successful \nsaving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a \nvolume ten times greater than the original \nf ire source. \n* Second, it can cause a thick, writhing \nstream of smoke to arise from the source \nand form a choking cloud that lasts for one \nround per experience level of the caster. This \ncovers a roughly hemispherical volume \nfrom the ground or floor up (or conforming \nto the shape of a confined area) that totally \nobscures vision beyond two feet. The smoke \na single fire source \n212"
