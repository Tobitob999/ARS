The \nspellcaster and any associates can simply \nwalk through. The spell causes a 5' wide x \n8' high x 10' deep opening. Several of these \nspells can form a continuing passage so that \nvery thick walls can be pierced. If dispelled, \nthe passwall closes away from the dispelling \ncaster, ejecting those in the passage. \nThe material component'of this spell is a \npinch of sesame seeds. \nSeeming (UusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 1Moot radius \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 12 hours \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 person/2 levels \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to alter the \nappearance of one person for every two \nlevels of experience he has attained. The \nchange includes clothing and equipment. \nThe caster can make the recipients appear as \nany generally man-shaped bipedal creature, \neach up to one foot shorter or taller than his \nnormal height, and thin or fat or in \nbetween. All those affected must resemble \nthe same general type of creature: human, \norc, ogre, etc. Each remains a recognizable \nindividual. The effect fails for an individual \nif the illusion chosen by the caster cannot be \naccomplished within the spell parameters \n[for example, a halfling could not be made \nto look like a centaur, but he might be made \nto look like a short, young ogre). Unwilling \npersons receive saving throws vs. spell to \navoid the effect. Affected persons resume \ntheir normal appearances if slain. The spell \nis not precise enough to duplicate the \nappearance of a specific individual. \n5ending (Evocation) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster can con- \ntact a single creature with whom he is famil- \niar and whose name and appearance are \nknown. If the creature in question is not on \nthe same plane of existence as the spellcast- \ner, there is a base 5% chance that the send- \ning does not amve. Local conditions on oth- \ner planes may worsen this chance \nconsiderably at the option of the DM. The \nsending, if successful, can be understood \neven by a creature with an Intelligence as \nlow as 1 (animal Intelligence). \nThe wizard can send a short message of 25 \nwords or less to the recipient. Also the recip- \nient can answer in like manner immediately. \nEven if the sending is received, the subject \ncreature is not obligated to act upon it in \nany manner. \nThe material component for this spell \nconsists of two tiny cylinders, each with one \nopen end, connected by a short piece of fine \ncopper wire. \nShadow Door (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \nthe illusion of a door. The illusion also per- \nmits the wizard to appear to step through \nthis \"door\" and disappear. In reality he has \ndarted aside and can flee, totally invisible, \nfor the spell duration. Creatures viewing \nthis are deluded into seeing or entering an \nempty 10' x 10' room if they open the \n\"door.\" A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, \nor similar magical means can discover the \nwizard. Certain high Hit Dice monsters \nmight also notice the wizard (see the invisi- \nbility spell), but only if making an active \nattempt to do so. \nShadow Magic (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 50 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe shadow magic spell enables the wiz- \nard to tap energy from the Shadow plane to \ncast a quasi-real wizard evocation spell of \n3rd level or less. For example, this spell can \nbe magic missile, fireball, lightning bolt, or \nso on, and has normal effects upon crea- \ntures in the area of effect if they fail their \nsaving throws vs. spell. Thus a creature fail- \ning to save against a shadow magic fireball \nmust roll another saving throw, suffering \nhalf of the normal fireball damage if suc- \ncessful and full normal fireball damage if the \nsaving throw is failed. If the first saving \nthrow was successful, the shadow magic \nnature is detected and only 20% of the \nrolled damage is received (rounding down \nbelow fractions below .4 and rounding up \nI \nfractions of .4 and above). \nStone Shape (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard can \nform an existing piece of stone into a shape \nthat suits his purposes. For example, a stone \nweapon can be made, a special trapdoor \nfashioned, or an idol sculpted. This spell \ncan also enable the spellcaster to reshape a \nstone door so as to escape imprisonment, \nproviding the volume of stone involved was \nwithin the limits of the area of effect. While \nstone coffers can be thus formed and stone \ndoors made, the fineness of detail is not \ngreat. If the construction involves small \nmoving parts, there is a 30% chance they do \nnot function. \nThe material component of this spell is \nsoft clay that must be worked into roughly \nthe desired shape of the stone object and \nthen touched to the stone when the spell is \nuttered. \nSummon Shadow \n(Conjuration/SummoninG Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard con- \njures up one shadow (see the Monstrous \nCompendium) for every three levels of \nexperience he has attained. These monsters \nare under the control of the spell& and \nattack his enemies on command. The \nshadows remain until slain, turned, or the \nspell duration expires. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nbit of smoky quartz. \nI \nTelekinesis (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto move objects by concentrating on mov- \ning them mentally. The spell can provide \neither a gentle, sustained force or a single \nshort, violent thrust. \nA sustained force enables the wizard to \nmove a weight of up to 25 pounds a distance \n171"
