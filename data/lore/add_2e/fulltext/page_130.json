    "text": "Appendix 2: Notes on Spells \nSpell Descriptions \nThe spalls are orga- \nnized according to their group (Priest or \nWizard) and level, starting an gage 131. \nWithin each level, the spells are arranged al- \nphabetically. At the start of each @ de- \nscription are the following important game \nstatistics: \nName: Each spell is identified by name. In \nparentheses after the name is the school (for \nwizard spells) to which that spell belongs. \nWhen more than one is listed, that spell is \ncommon to all schools given. \nSome spells are reversible (they can be \ncast for an effect opposite to that of the \nstandard spell). This is noted after the spell \nname. Priests with reversible spelb must \nmemorize the desired version. For example, \na priest who desires a cause fight wounds \nspell must petition for this form of the spell \nwhen meditating and praying. Note that se- \nvere penalties can result if the spell choice is \nat variance with the priest’s alignment (pos- \nsible penalties i cbde denial of specific \nspells, entire s 1 levels, or even all spells \nfor a certain pen . The exact result (if any) \ndepends on the $ eaction of the priest‘s pa- \ntron deity, as determined by the DM. \nd spells operate similarly. \nzE&g-ed, both forms are re- \ncorded in the wizard’s spell book. How- \never, the wizard must decide which version \nof thespell he desires to cast when memoriz- \ningthe spell, unless the spell description spe- \ncifically states otherwise. For example, a \nwizard who hasmemorized stone to flesh \nand desires to cast flesh to stone must wait \nuntil the latter form of the spell can be mem- \norized (i.e., rest eight hours and study). If he \ncan memorize two 6rh-level spells, he could \nmemorize each version once or one version \ntwice. \n%hook In parentheses after the spell \nname is the name of the school of magic to \nwhich the spell belongs. For wizard spells, \nthis defines which spells a wizard specialist \ncan learn, depending on the wizard’s school \nof specialization. For priest spells, the \nschool notation is used only for reference \npurposes, to indicate \nis considered to be10 \nneeds to know for \nelves’ resistance to charm spells). \nSph This entry appears only for priest \ngpells and identif‘ies the sphere or spheres \ninto which each spell falls. \nRange This lists the distance from the \ncaster at which the spell effect occurs or be- \ngins. A “0“ indicates the spell can be used on \nthe caster only, with the effect embodied \nwithin or emanating from him. Touch” \nmeans the caster can use the spell on others \nif he can physiully touch them. Unless oth- \nerwise specified, dl other spells are centered \non a point visible to the caster and within \nthe range of the spell. The point can be a \ncreature or object if desired. In general, a \nspell that affects a limited number of crea- \ntures within an area affects those closest to \nthe center first, unless there are other pa- \nrameters operating (such as level or Hit \nDice). Spells can be enst through narrow \nopenings only if both rhe caster‘s vision and \nthe spell energy can bedirected simultane- \nously through the opening. A wizard stand- \ning behind an arrow slit can cast through it; \nsending a fireball through a small peephole \nhe is peering through is another matter. \nComponents: This lists the category of \ncomponents needed, V for verbal, S for so- \nmatic, and M for material. When material \ncomponents are required, these are listed in \nthe spell description. Spell Components are \nexpended as the spell is cast, unless other- \nwise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not \nlost when a spell is cast. For cases in which \nmaterial components are expended at the \nend of the spell (free action, shapechange, \netc.), premature destruction of the compo- \nnents ends the spell. \nDuration: This lists how long the magical \nenergy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta- \nneous duration come and go the moment \nthey are cast, although the results of these \nspells may be permanent and unchangeable \nby normal means. Spells of permanent du- \nration last until the effects are negated by \nsome means, usually by a dispaf magir. \nSome spells have a variable duration. The \ncaster cannot choose the hatian of spells, \nin most cases‘ Spells with I?& dvations \n(e.g., 3 raunds/level of the wizard) must be \nkept track of by the player. Spells of varia- \nble duration (e+, 3 + ld4 rounds) are se- \naetly recorded by the DM. Your DM may \nwarn you when spell durations art ap- \npoaching expiration, but there is usually no \nsign that a spell is going to expire; check \nwith your DM to determine exactly how he \nhandles this issue. \nCertain spells can be ended at will by the \ncaster. In order to dismiss these spells, the \noriginal caster must be within range of the \nspell’s center of effect-within the same \nrange at which the spell can be cast. The \ncaster also must be able to speak words of \ndissnissal. Note that only the original caster \ncan dismiss his spells in this way. \nCasting Time: This errtry is important, if \nthe optional casting time modifier to initia- \ntive is used. If only a number is given, the \ncasting time is added to the caster‘s initiative \ndie rolls. If the spell requires a round or \nnumber of rounds to cast, it goes into effect \nat the end af the hst roundof casting time. \nIf Delsar~ra casts p spell that takes one \nround, it goes into effect at the end of the \nround in which she begins casting. If the \nspell requins three round8 to cast, it goes \n+to effect at the end of the third rod. \nSpells requiring a turn or more go into effect \nat the end of the stated turn. \nha of Effect: This lists the creatures. \nvolume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can \nbe affected by the spell. Spells with an area \nor volume that can be &aped by the caster \nwill, unless the spell description SpecifiCaMi \nstates otherwise, have a minimum dimen- \nsion of 10 feet in any direction. Thus a cloud \nthat has a 10-foot cube per caster htl \nmight, when cast by a 12th-level aster, \nhave dimensions 10’ x 10’ X 120’, 20’ x \n20‘ x m’, or any similar combination that \ntotals 12 IO-foot cubes. Combinations such \nas 5’ x 10‘ x 240’ are not possible unkss \nspecifically stated. \nSome spells (such as bless) affect the \nfriends or enemies of the caster. In all caws, \nthis refers to the perception of the caster at \nthe time the spell is cut. For example, a cha- \notic good character allied with a lawful m- \ntral cleric would receive the bendits of the \nlatter’s bless spell. \nSaving Throw This lists whether the spell \nallows the target a saving throw and ex- \nplains the effect of a surcessful save: “Neg.” \nresults in the spell having no effect; ’?2” \nmeans the character ders half the normal \namount of damage; “none” means no saving \nthrow is allowed. Wisdom adjustments to \nsaving throws apply only to enchantment/ \ncharm spells. \nSolid ph- barriers provide saving \nthrow bonuses and damage reduction. \nCover and concealment may affect slving \nthrows and damage (the DM has additional \ninformation about this). \nA creature that successfully saves against \na spell with no apparent physical effect \n(such as a charm, hold, or magic jar) may \nfeel a definite force or tingle that is charac- \nteristic of a magical attack, if the DM de- \nsires. But the exact hostile spell effect or \ncreature ability used cannot be deduced \nfrom this tingle. \nA being‘s ded equipment and posses- \nsions are assumed to make their saving \nthrows against special attacks if the creature \nmakes its saving throw, unkss the spell spe- \ncifically states otherwise. If the creature fails \nits saving throw, or if the attack form is par- \nticularly potent, saving throws may have to \nbe rolled to see if any possessions survive, \nusing either item saving throws (see the \nDMG) or the being‘s saving throw. The DM \nwill inform you when this happens. \nAny character can voluntarily forgo a \nsaving throw. This allows a spell or similar \nattack that normally grants a saving throw \nto have full effect on the character. Like- \nwise, any creature can voluntarily lower its \nmagic resistance allowing a spell to auto- \nmatically function when cast on it. Forego- \ning a saving throw or magic resistance roll \nneed not always be voluntary, If a creature \nor character can be tricked into lowring its \nresistance, the spell will have full effect, \neven if it is not the spell the victim believed \nhe was going to receive. The victim must"
