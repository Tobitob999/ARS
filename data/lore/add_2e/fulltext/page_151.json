    "text": "I1 Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nthe recipient by one year, because of sped- \nup metabolic processes. This spell is not cu- \nmulative with itself or with other similar \nmagic. \nIts material component is a shaving of lic- \norice root. \nHold Person (EnchantmenffCharm) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 persons in a \n20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell holds ld4 humans, demihu- \nmans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo- \nbile for five or more rounds. \nThe hold person spell affects any bipedal \nhuman, demihuman or humanoid of man- \nsize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, \ndwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, \nhalf-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, \nhumans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, ora, \npixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. \nThe spell is centered on a point selected \nby the caster; it affects persons selected by \nthe caster within the area of effect. If the \nspell is cast at three or four people, each gets \nan unmodified saving throw. If only two \npeople are being enspelled, each makes his \nsaving throw with a -1 penalty. If the spell \nis cast at only one person, the saving throw \nsuffers a -3 penalty. Saving throws are ad- \njusted for Wisdom. Those succeeding on \ntheir saving throws are unaffected by the \nspell. Undead creatures cannot be held. \nHeld beings cannot move or speak, but \nthey remain aware of events around them \nand can use abilities not requiring motion or \nspeech. Being held does not prevent the \nworsening of the subjects' condition due to \nwounds, disease, or poison. The caster can \nend the spell with a single utterance at any \ntime; otherwise the duration is 10 rounds at \n5th level, 12 rounds at 6th level, 14 rounds \nat 7th level, etc. \nThe spellcaster needs a small, straight \npiece of iron as the material component of \n+his spell. \nHdd Undead (Necromancy) \nRange: 60' \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: ld3 undead \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen cast, this spell renders immobile \nld3 undead creatures whose total Hit Dice \nare equal to or less than the caster's level. No \nmore than three undead can be affected by a \nsingle spell. To cast, the wizard aims the \nspell at a point within range and the three \nundead closest to this are considered to be in \nthe area of effect, provided all are within the \nfield of vision and spell range of the caster. \nUndead of a mindless nature (skeletons, \nzombies, or ghouls) are automatically af- \nfected. Other forms of undead are allowed a \nsaving throw to negate the effect. If the spell \nis successful, it renders the undead immobile \nfor the duration of the spell. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of sulphur and powdered garlic. \nIllusionary Script (hsion/Phantasm) \nRange:,Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Creature reading the script \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to write in- \nstructions or other information on parch- \nment, paper, etc. The illusionary script \nappears to be some form of foreign or magi- \ncal writing. Only the person (or people) \nwho the wizard desires to read the writing \ncan do so. An illusionist recognizes it for il- \nlusionary script. \nUnauthorized creatures glancing at the \nscript must roll saving throws vs. spell. A \nsuccessful save means the creature can look \naway with only a mild sense of disorienta- \ntion. Failure means the creature is subject to \na suggestion implanted in the script by the \ncaster at the time the illusionary script was \ncast. The suggestion cannot require more \nthan three turns to carry out. The sugges- \ntion could be to close the book and leave, or \nto forget the existence of the book, for ex- \nample. A successful dispel magic spell will \nremove the illusionary script, but an unsuc- \ncessful attempt erases all of the writing. The \nhidden writings can be read by a combina- \ntion of the true seeing spell and either the \nread magic or comprehend languages spell, \nas applicable. \nThe material component is a lead-based \nink that requires special manufacture by an \nalchemist, at a cost of not less than 300 gp \nper usage. \nInfravision (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard enables \nthe recipient to see in normal darkness up to \n60 feet without light. Note that strong \nsources of light (fire, lanterns, torches, etc.) \ntend to blind this vision, so infravision does \nnot function efficiently in the presence of \nsuch light sources. Invisible creatures are \n1 50 \nnot detectable by infravision. \nther a pinch of dried carrot or an agate. \nThe material component of this spell is ei- \nInvisibility, 10' Radius \n(Iflusion/Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius of \ncreature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell confers invisibility upon all \ncreatures within 10 feet of the recipient. \nGear carried and light sources are included, \nbut any light emitted is still visible. The cen- \nter of the effect is mobile with the recipient. \nThose affected by this spell cannot see each \nother. Any affected creature moving out of \nthe area becomes visible, but creatures mov- \ning into the area after the spell is cast do not \nbecome invisible. Affected creatures (other \nthan the recipient) that attack negate the in- \nvisibility only for themselves. If the spell re- \ncipient attacks, the invisibility, 10' radius \nspell is broken for all. \nThe material components are the same as \nfor the inaisibility spell. \nItem (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 2 cu. ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within \nthe size limit) to 1/12 of its normal size. Op- \ntionally, the caster can also change its now- \nshrunken composition to a cloth-like one. \nAn object in the possession of another crea- \nture is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Ob- \njects changed by an item spell can be \nreturned to normal composition and size \nmerely by tossing them onto any solid sur- \nface or by a word of command from the \noriginal spellcaster. Note that even a burn- \ning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this \nspell."
