    "text": "I Glossary \nAbility - any of the six natural traits that rep- \nresent the basic definition of a player char- \nacter: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, \nIntelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. A \nplayer character's abilities are determined at \nthe beginning of a game by rolling &sided \ndice (d6s). The scores continue to be used \nthroughout the game as a means of deter- \nmining success or failure of many actions. \nAbility check - a ld20 roll against one of \nyour character's ability scores (modifiers \nmay be added to or subtracted from the die \nroll). A result that is equal to or less than \nyour character's ability score indicates that \nthe attempted action succeeds. \nAC -abbreviation for Armor Class (9.u.). \nAlignment - a factor in defining a player \ncharacter that reflects his basic attitude to- \nward society and the forces of the universe. \nBasically there are nine categories demon- \nstrating the character's relationship to order \nvs. chaos and good vs. evil. A player char- \nacter's alignment is selected by the player \nwhen the character is created. \nArea of effect - the area in which a magical \nspell or a breath weapon works on any crea- \ntures unless they make a saving throw. \nArmor Class (ubbr. AC) - a rating for the \nprotective value of a type of armor, figured \nfrom 10 (no armor at all) to 0 or even -10 \n(the best magical armor). The higher the \nAC, the more vulnerable the character is to \nattack. \nAttack roll -The ld20 roll used to determine \nif an attack is successful. \nBend barsflift gates roll - the roll of percen- \ntile dice to determine whether a character \nsucceeds in bending metal bars, lifting a \nheavy portcullis, or similar task. The result \nneeded is a function of Strength and can be \nfound in Table 1. \nBonus spells - extra spells at various spell \nlevels that a priest is entitled to because of \nhigh Wisdom; shown in Table 5. \nBreath weapon - the ability of a dragon or \nother creature to spew a substance out of its \nmouth just by breathing, without making \nan attack roll. Those in the area of effect \nmust roll a saving throw. \nCha - abbreviation for Charisma (q.v.). \nChance of spell failure - the percentage \nchance that a priest spell will fail when cast. \nBased on Wisdom, it is shown in Table 5. \nChance to know spell - the percentage \nchance for a wizard to learn a new spell. \nBased on Intelligence, it is shown in Table 4. \nCharisma (ubbr. Cha) - an ability score rep- \nresenting a character's persuasiveness, per- \nsonal magnetism, and ability to lead. \nCommon - the language that all player char- \nacters in the AD&W game world speak. \nOther languages may require the use of pro- \nficiency slots. \nCon - abbreviation for Constitution (q.v.). \nConstitution (abbr. Con) - an ability score \nthat represents a character's general phy- \nsique, hardiness, and state of health. \nd - abbreviation for dice or die. A roll that \ncalls for2d6, for example, means that the \nplayer rolls two six-sided dice. \nd3 - since there is no such thing as a three- \nsided die, a roll calling for & means to use a \nd6, making 1 and 2 be a 1, 3 and 4 be a 2, \nand 5 and 6be a 3. \nd4 - a four-sided die. \nd6 - a six-sided die. \nd& - an eight-sided die. \nd1O - a ten-sided die. Two dlOs can be used \nas percentile dice (q.u.). \nd12 - a twelveaided die. \ndzo - a twenty-sided die. \ndloo - either an actual 1Wsided die or two \ndifferentcolored ten-sided dice to be rolled \nas percentile dice (q.u.). \nDMG - a reference to the Dungeon Master's \nGuide. \nDamage - the effect of a successful attack or \nother harmful situation, measured in hit \npoints. \nDemihuman - a player character who is not \nhuman: a dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, or \nhalfling. \nDex - abbreviation for Dexterity (q.u.). \nDexterity (ubbr. Dex) - an ability score rep- \nresenting a combination of a character's \nagility, reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and \nthe like. \nDual-class character - a human who \nswitches character class after having al- \nready progressed several levels. Only hu- \nmans can be dual-classed. \nEncumbrance - the amount, in pounds, that \na character is carrying. How much he can \ncarry and how being encumbered affects his \nmovement rate are based on Strength and \nare shown in Tables 47 and 48. Encum- \nbrance is an optional rule. \nEnergy drain - the ability of a creature, espe- \ncially undead, to drain energy in the form of \nclass levels from a character, in addition to \nthe normal loss of hit points. \nExperience points (ubbr. XP) - points a char- \nacter earns (determined by the Dungeon \nMaster) for completing an adventure, for \ndoing something related to his class particu- \nlarly well, or for salving a major problem. \nExperience points are accumulated, ena- \nbling the character to rise in level in his \nclass, as shown in Table 14 for warriors, Ta- \nble 20 for wizards, Table 23 for priests, and \nTable 25 for rogues. \nFollower - a non-player character who \nworks for a character for money but is ini- \ntially drawn to his reputation. \nGaze attrrck - the ability of a creature, such \nas a basilisk, to attack simply by making eye \ncontact with the victim. \nHenchmen - non-player characters who \nwork for a character mainly out of loyalty \nand love of adventure.

The DM \nand the player share control of the hench- \nmen. \nHireling - non-player characters who work \nfor a character just for money. Hirelings are \ncompletely under the control of the DM. \nHit dice - the dice rolled to determine a char- \nacter's hit points. Up to a certain level, one \nor more new Hit Dice are rolled each time a \ncharacter attains a new class level. A fighter, \nfor example, has only one IO-sided Hit Die \n(Idlo) at 1st level, but when he rises to the \n2nd level, the player rolls a second d10, in- \ncreasing the character's hit points. \nHit points - a number representing 1. how \nmuch damage a character can suffer before \nbeing killed, determined by Hit Dice (9.u.). \nThe hit points lost to injury can usually be \nregained by rest or healing. 2. how much \ndamage a specific attack does, determined \nby weapon or monster statistics, and sub- \ntracted from a player's total. \nInfravision - the ability of certain Character \nraces or monsters to see in the dark. Mra- \nvision generally works up to 60 feet in the \ndarkness. \nInitiative - the right to attack first in a com- \nbat round, usually determined by the Iowest \nroll of a 10-sided die. The initiative roll is \neliminated if surprise (q.u.) is achieved. \nInt -abbreviation for Intelligence (q.u.). \nInteUigence (ubbr. Int) -an ability score rep- \nresenting a character's memory, reasoning, \nand learning ability. \nItalic type - used primarily to indicate spells \nand magical items. \nLevel - any of several difkrent game factors \nthat are variable in degree, especially: 1. \nclass level, a measure of the character's \npower, starting at the 1st level as a begin- \nning adventurer and rising through the ac- \ncumulation of experience points to the 20th \nlevel or higher. At each level attained, the \ncharacter received new powers. 2. spell \nlevel, a measure of the power of a magical \nspell. A magic-using character can use only \nthose spells for which his class level qualifies \nhim. Wizard spells come in nine levels (\"a- \nble 21); priest spells in seven (Table 24), \nLoyalty base - a bonus added to or a penalty \nsubtracted from the probability that hench- \nmen are going to stay around when the go- \ning gets tough. Based on the character's \nCharisma, it is shown in Table 6. \nM - abbreviation for material component \n(S.U.). \nMagical defense adjustment - a bonus \nadded to or a penalty subtracted from sav- \ning throws vs. spells that attack the mind. \nBased on Wisdom, it is shown in Table 5. \nManeuverability class - a ranking for fiying \ncreatures that reflects their ability to tun \neasily in aerial combat. Each class-from a \ntop of A to a bottom rank of E-has specific \nstatistical abilities in combat. \nMaterial component (ubbr.
