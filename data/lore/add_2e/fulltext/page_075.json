The jousting lance is a heavy horse \nlance modified for use in tournaments, in \nwhich the desire is not to kill the opponent. \nThe end of the lance is fitted with a special \nblunted tip intended to lessen the chance of \nwounds. Of course, good intentions often \ngo awry, so there is still a chance of injury \nduring a joust. \nMancatcher: This item is a highly special- \nized type of polearm designed to capture \nwithout killing a victim. It consists of a long \npole with a spring-loaded set of sharpened \njaws at the end. The victim is caught \nbetween the arms, which then snap shut. \nThe mancatcher is effective only on man- \nsized matures. The target is always treated \nas AC 10, modified for Dexterity. If a hit is \nscored, the character is caught. The caught \nvictim loses all shield and Dexterity bonuses \nand can be pushed and pulled about. This \ncauses an automatic Id2 points of damage \nper round and gives a 25% chance of pulling \nthe victim to the ground. The victim can \nescape on a successful bend barsllift gates \nroll, although this results in ld2 points more \ndamage. A common tactic is to use the \nweapon to pull horsemen off their mounts, \nthen pin them to the ground. \nPolearms: A popular group of weapons \nduring the ancient and Medieval periods \nwere the polearms. Their length was a dis- \ntinct advantage and, for the peasant, they \nwere a relatively easy weapon to make. \nThus there came to be an abundance of \npolearms of different sizes and shapes. Due \nto their numbers, there is no standard sys- \ntem for naming polearms. The names used \nin the AD%P game might possibly be \napplied to other weapons elsewhere. \nBecause of their length, all polearms are \ninfantry weapons and require two hands to \nuse. They are almost always the weapon of \nthe common peasant and soldier, who, lack- \ning a horse and heavy armor, needs some \nweapon to keep the enemy's knights at bay. \nThus most polearms are intended to be used \nin close-packed formations that present a \nforest of sharp points and wicked blades to \nany knight foolish enough to charge. \nAwl Pike: Essentially this is a long spear \n12 to 20 feet long ending in a spike point of \ntapered spear head. It was a popular weap- \non during the Renaissance. Since the pike \nstuck out in front, men could be packed \nside-by-side in dense formations, and sev- \neral rows of men could fight. Large blocks \nof pikemen made formidable troops. How- \never, once the pikemen engaged in close \ncombat, they normally dropped their clum- \nsy awl pikes and fought hand-to-hand with \nshort swords. \nBardiche: One of the simplest of \npolearms, the bardiche is an elongated bat- \ntle axe. A large curving axe-head is mounted \non the end of a five- to eight-foot-long shaft. \nIt probably grew out of common peasant \ntools and was popular with them. One rela- \ntive disadvantage is that the bardiche \nrequired more space to wield than a pike or \na spear. \nBec de corbin: This was a highly special- \nized weapon of the upper classes during the \nLate Middle Ages and the early Renais- \nsance. It is an early can-opener designed \nspecifically to deal with plate armor. The \npick or beak is made to punch through \nplate, while the hammer side can be used to \ngive a stiff blow. The end is fitted with a \nshort blade for dealing with unarmored or \nhelpless foes. The weapon is about eight feet \nlong. Since the weapon relies on impact, a \ngreat deal of swinging space is needed. \nBill-guisarme: A particularly bizarre- \nlooking combination weapon, the bill- \nguisarme is an outgrowth of the common \nbill hook. Mounted on a seven- to eight- \nfoot-long pole, it has a combination of a \nheavy, cleaver blade, a jutting back spike, \nand a hook or spike on the end. Thus, it can \nbe used in several different ways. Like most \npolearms, it requires lots of room to use. \nFauchard: An outgrowth of the sickle and \nscythe, the fauchard is a long, inward curv- \ning blade mounted on a shaft six to eight feet \nlong. It can slash or thrust, although the \ninward curving point makes thrusting rath- \ner ineffective. Its advantage is that a peasant \ncan easily convert his common scythe into \nthis weapon of war. \nFauchard-fork: This is an attempted \nimprovement on the fauchard, adding a \nlong spike or fork to the back of the blade. \nSupposedly this improves the thrusting abil- \nity of the weapon. It is still an inefficient \nweapon. \nGlaive: One of the most basic polearms, \nthe glaive is a single-edged blade mounted \non a eight- to ten-foot-long shaft. While not \nthe most efficient weapon, it is relatively \neasy to make and use. Normally the blade \nturns outward to increase the cutting area \nuntil it almost resembles a cleaver or axe. \nGlaive-guisarme: Another combination \nweapon, this one takes the basic glaive and \nadds a spike or hook to the back of the \nblade. In theory, this increases the useful- \nness of the weapon although its actual appli- \ncation is somewhat questionable. \nGuisarme: Thought to have derived from \na pruning hook, this is an elaborately \ncurved heavy blade. While convenient and \nhandy, it is not very effective. \nGuisarme-voulge: This weapon has a \nmodified axe blade mounted on an eight- \nfoot-long shaft. The end of the blade tapers \nto a point for thrusting and a back spike is \nfitted for punching through armor. Some- \ntimes this spike is replaced by a sharpened \nhook for dismounting riders. \nHalberd: After the awl pike and the bill, \nthis was one of the most popular weapons of \nthe Middle Ages, Fixed on a shaft five to \neight feet long is a large axe blade, angled \nfor maximum impact. The end of the blade \ntapers to a long spear point or awl pike. On \nthe back is a hook for attacking armor or \ndismounting riders. Originally intended to \ndefeat cavalry, it is not tremendously suc- \ncessful in that role since it lacks the reach of \nthe pike and needs considerable room to \nswing. It found new life against blocks of \npikemen. Should the advance of the main \nattack stall, halberdiers issue out of the for- \nmation and attack the flanks of the enemy. \nThe pikemen with their overlong weapons \nare nearly defenseless in such close combat. \nHook fauchard: This combination weap- \non is another attempted improvement to \nfauchard. A back hook is fitted to the b \nof the blade, supposedly to dismount ho \nmen. Like the fauchard, this is not a tre \ndously successful weapon. \nthe bec de corbin. Fitted with a shaft u \nten feet long, it is usually fou \nof the common soldier. Like \nbin, its main purpose is to \narmor. The end is fitted wit \nof an awl pike to hold off e \nLucern hammer: This weapon is similar t \nlittle more than a pitchfork fixed to a longe \nshaft. With tines strengthened and strai \nened, the military fork serves well. Th \nfor cutting and cleaving eventually \nresults in combining the fork with \nweapons. \nPartisan: Shorter than the awl pike b \nlonger than the spear, the partisan is a broa \nspear-head mounted on an eight-foot-1 \nshaft. Two smaller blades project out f \nthe base of the main blade, just to incr \ndamage and trap weapons. Since it is \nthrusting weapon, it can be used in close1 \npacked formations. \nRanseur: Very much like the partisan \nranseur differs in that the main blade is t \nner and the projecting blades extended m \nlike tines of a fork. These can trap a weapo \nopponent. \nVodge: The voulge, like the bardiche, is a \nvariation on the axe and the cleaver. The \nvoulge is little more than a cleaver on the \nend of a long (seven- to eight-foot) pole. It is \na popular weapon, easy to make and simple \nto learn. It is also called the Lochaber axe. \nScourge: This wicked weapon is a short \nwhip with several thongs or tails. Each \nthong is studded with metal barbs, resulting \n74"
