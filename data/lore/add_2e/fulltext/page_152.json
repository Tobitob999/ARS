    "text": "Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nTI Leomund's Tiny Hut (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours + 1 houdlevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1.5-footdiameter sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nan unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any \ndesired color around his person. Half of the \nsphere projects above the ground, and the \nlower hemisphere passes through the \nground. Up to seven other man-sized crea- \ntures can fit into the field with its creator, \nand these can freely pass into and out of the \nhut without harming it, but if the spellcaster \nremoves himself from it, the spell dissipates. \nThe temperature inside the hut is 70\" F, if \nthe exterior temperature is between 0\" and \n100\" E An exterior temperature below Oo or \nabove 100° lowers or raises, respectively, \nthe interior temperature on a Io-for-l0 \nbasis. The tiny hut also provides protection \nagainst the elements, such as rain, dust, \nsandstorms, and the like. The hut can with- \nstand any wind of less than hurricane force \nwithout being harmed, but wind force \ngreater than that destroys it. \nThe interior of the hut is a hemisphere; \nthe spellcaster can illuminate it dimly upon \ncommand, or extinguish the light as desired. \nNote that although the force field is opaque \nfrom the outside, it is transparent from \nwithin. Missiles, weapons, and most spell \neffects can pass through the hut without \naffecting it, although the occupants cannot \nbe seen from outside the hut. The hut can be \ndispelled. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall crystal bead that shatters when the \nspell duration expires or the hut is dispelled. \nLightning Bolt (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard \nreleases a powerful stroke of electrical \nenergy that inflicts ld6 points of damage per \nlevel of the spellcaster (maximum damage of \n1Od6) to each creature within its area of \neffect. A successful saving throw vs. spell \nreduces this damage to half (round fractions \ndown). The bolt begins at a range and \nheight decided by the caster and streaks out- \nward in a direct line from the casting wizard \n(e.g., if a *foot bolt was started at 180 feet \nfrom the wizard, the far end of bolt would \nreach 220 feet (180 + 40). The lightning bolt \nmay set fire to combustibles, sunder wood- \nen doors, splinter up to % foot thickness of \nstone, and melt metals with a low melting \npoint (lead, gold, copper, silver, bronze). \nSaving throws must be rolled for objects \nthat withstand the full force of a stroke (see \nthe fireball spell). If the damage caused to an \ninterposing barrier shatters or breaks \nthrough it (i.e., the saving throw fails), the \nbolt continues. A bolt can breach one inch \nof wood or 112 inch of stone per caster level \nup to a maximum of one foot of wood or 1/z \nfoot of stone. \nThe lightning bolt's area of effect is cho- \nsen by the spellcaster: either a forked bolt \n10 feet wide and 40 feet long or a single bolt \nfive feet wide and 80 feet long. If a bolt can- \nnot reach its full length, because of an \nunyielding barrier (such as a stone wall), the \nlightning bolt rebounds from the barrier \ntoward its caster, ending only when it reach- \nes its full length. \nExample: An 80-foot-long stroke is \nbegun at a range of 40 feet, but it hits a stone \nwall at 50 feet. The bolt travels 10 feet, hits \nthe wall, and rebounds for 70 feet back \ntoward its creator (who is only 50 feet from \nthe wall, and so is caught in his own light- \nning bolt!). \nThe DM might allow reflecting bolts. \nWhen this type of lightning bolt strikes a \nsolid surface, the bolt reflects from the sur- \nface at an angle equal to the angle of inci- \ndence (like light off a mirror). A creature \ncrossed more than once by the bolt must roll \na saving throw for every time it is crossed, \nbut it still suffers either full damage (if one \nsaving throw is missed) or half damage (if \nall saving throws are made). \nThe material components of the spell are \na bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass \nrod. \nMelf's Minute Meteors \n(Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 70 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 target per meteor \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to cast small \nglobes of fire (one for each experience level \nhe has attained), each of which bursts into a \none-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, \ninflicting ld4 points of damage to the crea- \nture struck. It can also ignite combustible \nmaterials (even solid planks). The meteors \nue treated as missiles hurled by the wizard \nNith a +2 bonus to the attack rolls and with \nIO penalty for range. Misses are treated as \np-enade-like missiles that inflict 1 point of \niamage to creatures within three feet. \nThe spell can be cast in either of two \nvays: \nA) The wizard discharges five meteors \nvery round (see the \"Multiple Attacks and \nInitiative\" section, page 95). Note that this \ncarries over into at least the following \nround. \nB) The wizard discharges only one meteor \nper round. In addition to releasing the mis- \nsile, the caster can perform other actions in \nthe round, including spellcasting, melee, or \ndevice use. Spells requiring concentration \nforce the wizard to forgo the rest of the mb \ndes to maintain concentration. Also, if the \nwizard fails to maintain an exact mental \ncount of the number of missiles he has \nremaining, he has involuntarily lost the \nremaining portion of the spell. \nThe spell ends when the caster has fired \noff as many meteors as he has experience \nlevels, when he forgoes casting any still \nremaining, or when a successful dispel mag- \nic spell is thrown upon the caster. \nThe components necessary for the casting \nof this spell are nitre and sulphur formed \ninto a bead by the addition of pine tar. The \ncaster must also have a small hollow tube of \nminute proportion, fashioned from gold. \nThe tube costs no less than 1,OOO gp to con- \nstruct, so fine is its workmanahip and magi- \ncal engraving, and it can be reused. \nMonster Summ \n(ConjuraHonBu \nRange: 30 yards \n'Componeqts: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWithin one round of casting this spell, the \nwizard magically conjures 2d4 1st-level \nmonsters (selected by the DM, from his ld- \nlevel encounter tables). The monsters \nappear in an area within the spell range, as \ndesired by the wizard. They attack the spell \nuser's opponents to the best of their ability \nuntil either he commands that the attacks \ncease, the spell duration expires, or the \nmonsters are slain. These creatures do not \ncheck morale, but they vanish when slain. \nNote that if no opponent exists to fight, \nsummoned monsters can, if the wizard can \ncommunicate with them and if they are \nphysically able, perform other services for \nthe summoning wizard. \nIn rare cases, adventurers have been \nknown to disappear, summoned by power- \nful spellcasters using this spell. Those sum- \nmoned recall all the details of their trip. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \n151"
