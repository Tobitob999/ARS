It can be mag- \nically dispelled, or eliminated after receiv- \ning 6 points of damage from area-effect \nspells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. If \nthe caster attempts to ‘md it beyond the \nallowed radius, the spell ends immediately. \nThe material components of the spell are \na uiece of string and a bit of wood. \nVemtrlloqulsm (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 10 yards/lwel, maximum 90 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to make his \nvoice-or someone else’s voice-or a simi- \nlar sound seem to issue from someplace else, \nsuch as from another creature, a statue, \nfrom behind a door, down a pa-, etc. \nThe spellcaster can speak in any language \nthat he knows, or make any sound that he \ncan normally make. With respect to such \nvoices and sounds, anyone rolling a success- \nful saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty \ndetects the ruse. If cast in conjunction with \nother illusions, the DM may rule greater \npenalties or disallow an independent saving \nthrow against this spell in consideration of \nits contribution to the total effect of the \ncombined illusion. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nparchment rolled up into a small cone. \nWall of Fog (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard creates a \nbillowing wall of misty vapors in any area \nwithin the spell range. The wall of fog \nobscures all sight, normal and infravision, \nbeyond two feet. The caster may create less \nvapor if he wishes. The wall must be a \nroughly cubic or rectangular mass, at least \nten feet wide in its smallest dimension. The \nmisty vapors persist for three or more \nrounds. Their duration can be halved by a \nmoderate wind, and they can be blown \naway by a strong wind. \nThe material component is a pinch of split \ndried peas. \nWizard Muk (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Up to 1 square foot \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto inscribe, visibly or invisibly, his personal \nrune or mark, as well as up to six additional \ncharacters of smaller size. A wizard mark \nspell enables the caster to etch the rune upon \nstone, metal, or any softer substance with- \nout harm to the material upon which the \nmark is placed. If an invisible mark is made, \na detect magic spell will cause it to glow and \nbe visible (though not necessarily under- \nstandable). Detect invisibility, true seeing, a \ngem of seeing, or a robe of eyes will likewise \nexpose an invisible wizard mark. A read \nmagic spell will reveal the maker’s words, if \nany. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it \ncan be removed by the caster or by an eruse \nspell. If cast on a living being, normal wear \ngradually causes the mark to fade. \nThe material components for this spell are \na pinch of diamond dust (about 100 gp \nworth) and a pigment or pigments for the \ncoloration of the mark. If the mark is to be \ninvisible, the pigments are still used, but the \ncaster uses a stylus of some sort rather than \nhis finger. \n139 \nSecond-Level Spells \nAlter Self (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3d4 rounds + 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can \nalter his appearance and form-including \nclothing and equipment-to appear taller or \nshorter; thin, fat, or in between; human, \nhumanoid, or any other generally man- \nshaped bipedal creature. The caster‘s body \ncan undergo a limited physical alteration \nandhissizecanbech~edupto509b.Ifthe \nform selected has wings, the wizard can \nactually fly, but at only 1/3 the speed of a \ntrue creature of that type, and with a loss of \ntwo maneuverability classes (to a minimum \nof E). If the form has gills, the caster can \nbreathe underwater as long as the spell lasts. \nHowever, any multiple attack routines or \nadditional damage allowed to an assumed \nform are not gained by the caster. \nThe caster’s attack rolls, Annor Class, \nand saving throws do not-change. The spell \ndoes not confer special abilities, attack \nforms, or defenses. Once the new form is \nchosen, it remains for the duration of the \nspell. The caster can change back into his \nown form at will; this ends the spell immedi- \nately. A caster who is slain automatically \nreturns to his normal form. \nMnd (Enchantment) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is employed, the wizard \ncan command any non-living ropelike \nobject, including string, yarn, cord, line, \nrope, or wen a cable. The spell affects 50 \nfeet of normal rope (one-inch diameter), \nplus five feet per caster level. This length is \nreduced by 50% for wery additional inch of \nthickness and increases by 50% for each ’/a \ninch less. The possible commands are Coil \n(form a neat, coiled stack), Coil & Knot, \nLoop, Loop & Knot, Tie 8t Knot, and the \nreverses of all of the above (Uncoil, etc.). \nOne command can be given each round. \nThe rope can only enwrap a creature or \nan object within one foot of it-it does not \nsnake outward-so it must be thrown or \nhurled near the intended target. Note that \nthe rope itself, and any knots tied in it, are \nnot magical. A typical rope might be AC 6 \nand take 4 points of slashing damage before \nbreaking. The rope does not inflict damage"
