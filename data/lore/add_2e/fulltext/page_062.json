    "text": "Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nThus the character could catch a dagger or a \ndart before it hits. If this attack roll fails, \nhowever, the character automatically suf- \nfers damage (sticking your hand in the path \nof a dagger is likely to hurt). \nJumping: The character can attempt \nexceptional leaps both vertically and hor- \nizontally. If the character has at least a 20- \nfoot running start, he can leap (broad jump) \n4d6 + his level in feet. No character can \nbroad jump more than six times his height, \nhowever. With the same start, he can leap \nvertically (high jump) Id3 plus half his level \nin feet. No character can high jump more \nthan 1% times his own height. \nFrom a standing start, a character with \nthis proficiency can broad jump ld6 plus \nhalf his level in feet and high jump only \nthree feet. \nThe character can also attempt vaults \nusing a pole. A vault requires at least a 30- \nfoot running start. If a pole is used, it must \nbe four to 10 feet longer than the character’s \nheight. The vault spans a distance equal to \n1% times the length of the pole. The charac- \nter can clear heights equal to the height of \nthe pole. He can also choose to land on his \nfeet if the vault carries him over an obstacle \nno higher than Vz the height of his pole. \nThus, using a 12-foot pole, the character \ncould either vault through a window 12 feet \noff the ground (tumbling into the room \nbeyond), land on his feet in an opening six \nfeet off the ground, or vault across a moat \n18 feet wide. In all cases, the pole is dropped \nat the end of the vault. \nLanguages, Ancient: The character has \nmastered a difficult and obscure tongue, \nnow primarily found in the writings of \npedantic sages and sorcerers. The main use \nof the language is to read tomes of ancient \nsecrets written by longdead mystics. This \nproficiency enables the character to either \nread and write or speak the language (his \nchoice). \nLanguages, Modem: The character has \nlearned to speak a language of the known \nworld. To do so, there must be a teacher \navailable. This could be another player \ncharacter, an NPC hireling, or simply a \nlocal townsman. \nLeathemorking. This proficiency enables \na character to tan and treat leather and to \nmake clothing and other leather objects. \nThe character can make leather armor, as \nwell as backpacks, saddlebags, saddles, and \nall sorts of harnesses. \nLocal History: The character is a store- \nhouse of facts about the history of a region \nthe size of a large county or a small prov- \nince. The character knows when the ruined \ntower on the hill was built and who built it \n(and what happened to him), what great \nheroes and villains fought and fell at the old \nbattlefield, what great treasure is supposed \nto be kept in a local temple, how the mayor \nof the next town miraculously grew hair on \nhis balding pate, and more. \nThe DM will provide information about \nlocal sites and events as the character needs \nto know them. Furthermore, the character \ncan try to retell these events as entertaining \nstories. Once the subject is chosen, he can \neither make a proficiency check and, if suc- \ncessful, add that tale to his repertoire, or \nactually tell the story to other characters. If \nthe character succeeds in entertaining them, \nthe player need not make a proficiency roll \nfor the character, since he has succeeded. \nThe character can tell these stories to enter- \ntain others, granting him a +2 bonus to his \nCharisma for the encounter. But telling sto- \nries to hostile beings is probably not going \nto do any good. \nMining. A character with mining profi- \nciency is needed to site and supervise the \noperations of any mine. First, the character \ncan attempt to determine what types of ores \nor gems can be found in a given area. To do \nthis, he must spend at least a week searching \na four-square-mile area. The DM may rule \nthat more area must be searched to find any- \nthing of value and may thus increase the \namount of time required. At the end of the \nsearch, the character can say what is likely \nto be found in this area. After this, the char- \nacter can site the mine. On a successful pro- \nficiency check (made secretly by the DM), \nthe character has found a good site to begin \nmining for any minerals that may be in the \narea. The check does not guarantee a suc- \ncessful mine, only that a particular site is the \nbest choice in a given area. The DM must \ndetermine what minerals, if any, are to be \nfound in the region of the mine. On a failed \ncheck, the character only thinks he has \nfound a good site. Much effort is spent \nbefore the character is proved wrong, of \ncourse. \nOnce the mine is in operation, a character \nwith mining proficiency must remain on- \nsite to supervise all work. Although this is a \nsteady job, most player characters will find \nit better to hire an NPC for this purpose. \nMountaineerins A character with this \nproficiency can make difficult and danger- \nous climbs up steep slopes and cliffs with the \naid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with \nmountaineering proficiency leads a party, \nplacing the pitons (spikes) and guiding the \nothers, all in the party can gain the benefit \nof his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide \na party up a cliff face it could not otherwise \nclimb. A character with this proficiency \ngains a 10 percent bonus per proficiency slot \nspent to his chance to climb any surface. \nNote that mountaineering is not the same as \nthe thief‘s climbing ability, since the latter \ndoes not require aids of any sort. \nMusical Instrument: The character can \nplay a specific musical instrument. An addi- \ntional instrument can be added for every \nextra slot devoted to this proficiency. The \ncharacter plays quite well, and no proficien- \n61 \ncy check is normally requ \ndirect the character to-make a proficiency \ncheck in what he feels are extraordinary cir- \ncumstances. \nNavigation: The character has learned the \narts of navigating by the stars, studying cur- \nrents, and watc for telltale signs of \nland, reefs, and hid 9 en danger. This is not \nparticularly useful on land. At sea, a suc- \ncessful proficiency check by the navigator \nreduces the chance of getting lost by 20 per- \ncent. \nPottery: A character with this proficiency \ncan create any type of clay vessel or con- \ntainer commonly used in the campaign \nworld. The character requires a wheel and a \nkiln, as well as a supply of clay and glaze. \nThe character can generally create two \nsmall- or medium-sized items or one large- \nsized item per day. The pieces of pottery \nmust then be fired in the kiln for an addi- \ntional day. \nThe raw materials involved cost three cp \nto make a small item, five cp to make a \nmedium-sized item, and one sp to make a \nlarge item. \nReading Lips: The character can under- \nstand the speech of those he can see but not \nhear. When this proficiency is chosen, the \nplayer must specify what language the char- \nacter can lip read (it must be a language the \ncharacter can already speak). To use the \nproficiency, the character must be within 30 \nfeet of the speaker and be able to see him \nspeak. A proficiency check is made. If the \ncheck fails, nothing is learned. If the check is \nsuccessful, 70 percent of the conversation is \nunderstood. Since certain sounds are impos- \nsible to differentiate, the understanding of a \nlip-read conversation is never better than \nthis. \nReadinglWriting. The character can read \nand write a modern language he can speak, \nprovided there is someone available to teach \nthe character (another PC, a hireling, or an \nNPC). This proficiency does not enable the \ncharacter to learn ancient languages (see \nLanguages, Ancient). \nReligion: Characters with religion profi- \nciency know the common beliefs and cults \nof their homeland and the major faiths of \nneighboring regions. Ordinary information \n(type of religious symbol used, basic atti- \ntude of the faith, etc.) of any religion is \nautomatically known by the character. Sp- \ncial information, such as how the clergy is \norganized or the significance of particular \nholy days, requires a proficiency check. \nAdditional proficiencies spent on religion \nenable the character either to expand his \ngeneral knowledge into more distant \nregions (using the guidelines above) or to \ngain precise information about a single \nfaith. If the latter is chosen, the character is \nno longer required to make a proficiency \ncheck when answering questions about that \nreligion. Such expert knowledge is highly"
