    "text": "tial list of your skills: \nEnglish reading and writing \nGeometry, algebra, and trigonometry \nBasic chemistry \nBasic Dhvsics a. \nMusic (playing an instrument, singing, or \nboth) \nSpanish reading and writing (or French, \nBasic Shop or Home Economics \nTyping \nDriving \nHistory \nBasic biology \nIn addition to the things learned i \nschool, you have also learned things fror \nyour parents, friends, scouts, or othe \ngroups. You might be able to add any of th \nfollowing to your list. \nGerman, etc.) \n- \nSwimmimz \nI \nHunting \nFishing \n, Sailing \nCanoeing \n' Horseback riding \nFirst aid \nAnimal training \ncooking \nSewing \nEmbroidery \nDancing \nIf you consider all your hobbies and all \nthe things you have done, you probably \nknow many more skills. In fact, if you make \na list, you probably will be surprised by the \nlarge number of basic skills you have. And, \nat this point, you are (or were) still young1 \nNow, having graduated from school, you \nget a job. Are you just a carpenter, mechan- \nic, electrician, salesman, or secretary? Of \ncoursenot; you are a lot more than just your \njob. All those things you learned in school \nand elsewhere are part of what you are. \nShouldn't it be the same for your player \ncharacter? \nFor a really complete role-playing charac- \nter, you should know what your character \ncan do. There are three different ways to do \nthis: using what you know, using second- \nary skills, and using nonweapon proficien- \ncies. Each of these is optional, but,each \ninaeases the amount of detail that rounds \nout your character. \nUsing What You Know \nIf your DM decides \nnot to use secondary skills or nonweapon \nproficiencies, situations will arise in which \nyou'll have to determine whether your char- \nacter has certain skills. For example, \nDelsenora the mage slips at the edge of a \nsteep riverbank and tumbles into the water. \nThe current sweeps her into the middle of \nthe river. To escape, she must swim to \nsafety. But does Delsenora know how t \nswim? \nOne way to answer this is to pretend tha \nyour character knows most of the thing \nthat you know. Do you know how to swim \nIf you do, then your character can swim. 1 \nyou know a little about mountain climbing \nhorseback riding, carpentry, or sewing \nyour character knows these things, too \nThis also applies to things your characte \nmight want to build. Perhaps your charac \nter decides he wants to build a catapult. I \nyou can show your DM how to make such i \ndevice, then the DM may allow your char. \nacter the same knowledge. Indeed, yor \nmight visit the local library just to gain this \ninformation. \nThere are real advantages to this method. \nYou can learn something at the library 01 \nschool and bring it into your game. Also, \nthere are fewer rules to get in the way of \nyour fun. Since there are fewer rules, your \nDM has a lot of flexibility and can play out \nall the drama inherent in a scene. \nThere,are also problems with this meth- \nod. First, you probably know a lot of things \nyour character should not-basic electron- \nics, the components of gunpowder, or calcu- \nlus, for instance. You have a lot of \nknowledge that is just not available to \nsomeone in a medieval world (even a fanta- \nsy medieval world). Likewise, there are \nthings that a typical person in a medieval \nworld would know that you, as a modem \nperson, have never needed to learn. Do you \nknow how to make armor? Skin a deer? Salt \nmeat away for the winter? Turn flax into lin- \nm? Thatch a roof? Read heraldry? You \nnight, but there is no way you can consider \n:hese common skills anymore. But in a \nnedieval world they would be common. \nAlso, knowing something about a skill or \nrade doesn't mean you know a lot, and \nhere is a big difference between the two. \n&en Delsenora fell into the raging river, \nhe had to swim out. But was she a strong \nnough swimmer to pull free of the current? \n'he DM must make up a rule on the spot to \niandle the situation. Perhaps you can swim, \nvt can you swim well enough to escape a \naging torrent? \nThe biggest drawback to this method is \n?at there are no rules to resolve tricky situ- \ntions. The DM must make it up during \nlay. Some players and DMs enjoy doing \nus. They think up good answers quickly. \nlany consider this to be a large part of the \nin. This method is perfect for them, and \nley should use it. \nOther players and DMs like to have clear \ndes to prevent arguments. If this is the case \nI your group, it is better to use secondary \n  ills or nonweapon proficiencies. \n53 \nRoll \n01-02 \n03-04 \n05-10 \n11-14 \n15-20 \n21-23 \n14-27 \nB-32 \n53-34 \n15-57 \n18-39 \n,042 \n3-44 \n5-46 \n7-49 \n0-51 \n2-53 \n54-56 \n57-59 \n60-62 \n63-66 \n67-68 \n69-7l \n72-85 \n86-00 \nSecondary Skills \nfor determining what your character know \nis to assign secondary skills. Secondvy \nskills are broad areas of expertise. Most cor- \nrespond to occupations that your character \nmay have been apprenticed in or otherwise \npicked up before besinning his adventuriF- \nlife. Secondary skills are much more germ \nthan nonweapon profiaencies. They should \nnot be used in combination with non- \nweapon proficiencies, which are \nlater. \nEvery player character has a \nsecondary skill. Ether choose one from \nTable 36 or take a chance and roll randomly. \nA random roll may result in one, two, or no \nsecondary skills. \nTable 36: SECONDARY SKULS \nDlOO \nSecondary Skill \nArmorer (make, rep, , - ____ \nate armor and weapons) \nn \nI \nI \nFisher (swimming, nets, and srna \nboat handling) \nForester (basic wood lore, lmh. \ning) \nGambler (knowledge of gam&% \ngames) \nGroom (animal handiirilc) \nHunter (basic wood lore, but€ \ning, basic tracking) \nJeweler (appraisa€ of gems and \njewelry) \nLeather worker lskinnine tm= \nnind \nLimnerIPainter \nappraisal of art < \nI \n_- \nI \nMason (stone-cutthg) \nMiner (stone-cutting, asspyinn) \nNavigator (astronomy, M - \nswimming, navigation) - \nSailor (sailing, swimming \nScribe (reading, writing, ba&- 1 \nmath) \nTailor/Weaver (weaving, sewir,, \nembroidery) \nTeamster/Freiehter (animal ban- \nshipwright (sailing, carpentry) \nv \ndling, wagon-repair) \nTrader/ Barterer (appraisal \ncommon goods) \nTrapper/Furrier (basic w \nskinning) \nWeaponsmith (make, repair, & \nevaluate weapons) \nWoodworker/Carpenter \ntry, carving) \nNO skill of measureable wnrth \nRoll twice (reroll any result of \n86-00)"
