As these powers resent \nsuch contact, only brief answers are given. \n(The DM answers all questions with \"yes,\" \n\"no,\" \"maybe,\" \"never,\" \"irrelevant,\" etc.) \nAny questions asked are answered by the \npower during the spell's duration. The char- \nacter can contact an elemental plane or \nsome plane farther removed. For every two \nlevels of experience of the wizard, one ques- \ntion may be asked. Contact with minds far \nremoved from the plane of the wizard \nincreases the probability of the spellcaster \ngoing insane or dying, but the chance of the \npower knowing the answer, as well as the \nprobability of the being telling the correct \nanswer, are likewise increased by moving to \ndistant planes. Once the outer planes are \nreached, the Intelligence of the power con- \ntacted determines the effects. \nThe random table given here is subject to \nDM changes, development of extraplanar \nNPC beine, and so on. \nIf insanity occurs, it strikes as soon as the \nfirst question is asked. This condition lasts \nfor one week for each removal of the plane \ncontacted (see the DMG or Manual of the \nPlanes), to a maximum of ten weeks. There \nis a 1 % chance per plane that the wizard dies \nbefore recovering, unless a remove curse \nspell is cast upon him. A surviving wizard \ncan recall the answer to the question. \nOn rare occasions, this divination may be \nblocked by the action of certain lesser or \ngreater powers. \ncific outer plane to be contacted (s \nManual of ;he Planes); in this case, \ndifference in alignment between the c \ner and the plane contacted alters \nmaximum Intelligence that can \ncontacted-each difference in moral \nethical alignment lowers the maxim \nIntelligence that can be contacted by \n(e.g., an 18th-level lawful good cast \ncould contact the plane of the Seven \nHeavens (LG) on the \"Intelligence 20\" \nline, or the plane of Elysium (NG) on the \n\"Intelligence 19\" linl \nDemi-Shadow Monsters \n(IllusiodPhantasrn) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to the 4th-level spell, \nshadow monsters, except that the monsters \ncreated are effectively 40% of normal hit \npoints. If the saving throw is made, their \ndamage potential is only 40% of normal \nand their Armor Class is 8. The monsters \nhave none of the special abilities of the real \ncreatures, although victims may be deluded \ninto believing this to be so. \nChance of Chance of Chance of \nemental \nmer Plar \no.P., Intelligence 20 \n0.P..

If the chance of veracity is made, the being will \nanswer \"unknown.\" \nPercentages in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate elemental \nplane. \n167 \nDismissal (Abjuration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, a wizard on the \nPrime Material plane seeks to force or to \nenable a creature from another plane of \nexistence to return to its proper plane. Mag- \nic resistance, if any, is checked if this spell is \nused to force a being home. If the resistance \nfails, the caster's level is compared to the \ncreature's level or Hit Dice. If the wizard's \nlevel is higher, the difference is subtracted \nfrom the creature's die roll for its saving \nthrow vs. spell. If the creature's level w Hit \nDice is higher, the difference is added to the \nsaving throw roll. \nIf the creature desires to be returned to its \nhome plane, no saving throw is necessary (it \nchooses to fail the roll). \nIf the spell is successful, the creature is \ninstantly whisked away, but the spell has a \n20% chance of actually sending the subject \nto a plane other than its own. \nThe material component is any item that \nis distasteful to the subject creature. \nDistance Distortion (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration! 2 turns/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube per lrvd \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast only in an area \npletely surrounded or enclosed by ea&, \nrock, sand, or similar materials. The wizard \nmust also cast a conjure elemental spell to \nsummon an earth elemental. The elemental \nserves without attempting to break free \nwhen the spellcaster announces that his \nintent is to cast a distance distortion spell. \nThe spell places the earth elemental in the \narea of effect, and the elemental then causes \nthe area's dimensions to be either doubled or \nhalved for those traveling over it (spellcud- \ner's choice of which). Thus a 10' x 100' cor- \nridor could seem to be either five feet wide \nand 50 ket long or 20 feet wide and 200 fegt \nlong. When the spell duration has elapsed, \nthe elemental returns to its own plane. \nThe true nature of an area affected by die \ntance distortion is undetectable to any crea- \nture traveling along it, but the area dimly \nradiates magic, and-a true seeing spell can \nreveal that an earth elemental is spread \nwithin the area. \nThe material needed for this spell is a \nsmall lump of soft clay."
