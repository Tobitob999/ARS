    "text": "I Time and Movement (Climbing) I \nHolding Your Breath \nUnder normal cir- \ncumstances (with a good gulp of air and not \nperforming strenuous feats), a character can \nhold his breath up to l/3 his Constitution \nscore in rounds (rounded up). If the charac- \nter is exerting himself, this time is halved \n(again rounded up). Characters reduced to \nV3 or less of their normal movement be- \ncause of encumbrance are always consid- \nered to be exerting themselves. If unable to \nget a good gulp of air, these times are re- \nduced by l/2. All characters are able to hold \ntheir breath for one round, regardless of cir- \ncumstances. \nWhile attempting to hold his breath be- \nyond this time, the character must roll a \nConstitution check each round. The first \ncheck hasno modifiers, but each subsequent \ncheck suffers a -2 cumulative penalty. \nOnce a check is failed, the character must \nbreathe (if he cannot reach the surface, he \nowns). \nDiving: All characters can dive to a depth \nf 20 feet in a single round. For each encum- \nrance category above unencumbered (or \nfor each point of movement below the char- \nacter‘s normal rate, if this optional system is \nused-see page 76), two feet is added to this \ndepth (the additional weight helps pull the \ncharacter down). A short run or a few feet \nof height adds 10 feet of depth to the first \nround of a dive. For every 10 feet of height \nabove the water, an additional five feet of \ndepth is added, up to a maximum addition \nof 20 feet. Thus, with a run and from a \nheight of 40 feet or more, an unencumbered \nman can dive 50 feet in a single round. \nSurfacing: A character can normally rise \nat the rate of 20 feet per round. This rate is \nreduced by two feet for every encumbrance \ncategory above unencumbered or for every \npoint of current movement below the char- \nacter’s normal rate (if this optional system is \nused). Note that, under the optional encum- \nbrance system, heavily loaded characters \n(those who have lost 10 or more points off \ntheir normal movement rate because of their \ncurrent encumbrance) cannot even swim to \nthe surface. Those simply floating to the \nsurface (unconscious characters, for exam- \nple) rise at a rate that is five feet per round \nslower than someone similarly encumbered \nwho is actively swimming up to the surface. \nIt is quite possible for a moderately \nwe&eddown character to sink if he makes \nno effort to stay on the surface. \nClimbing \nAlthough thieves \nhave specialized climbing abilities, all char- \nacters are able to climb to some degree or \nanother. Climbing ability is divided into \nthree categories: thief, mountaineer, and \nunskilled. \nThieves are the most skilled at climbing. \nThey are the only characters who can climb \nvery smooth, smooth, and rough surfaces \nwithout the use of ropes or other equip- \nment. They are the fastest of all climbers \nand have the least chance of falling. \nMountaineers are characters with moun- \ntaineering proficiency or those the DM \ndeems to possess this skill. They have a bet- \nter climbing percentage than unskilled char- \nacters. Mountaineers with proper equip- \nment can climb very smooth, smooth, and \nrough surfaces. They can assist unskilled \ncharacters in an types of climbs. \nUnskilled climbers are the vast majority \nof characters. While they are able to scram- \nble over rocks, they cannot use climbing \nequipment or negotiate very smooth, \nsmooth, and rough surfaces. They have the \nlowest climbing success rate of all charac- \nters. \nCalculatlng Success \nThe chance of suc- \ncess of a climb is calcuIated by taking the \ncharacter’s skill level (given as a percentage) \nand modifying it for his race, the condition \nof the surface, and situational modifiers. Ta- \nble 65 lists the percentages for the different \ncategories of climbers. \nThe chance of success given in Table 65 is \nmodified by many factors. Some of these re- \nmain the same from climb to climb (such as \na character’s race) and can be figured into \nthe character’s base score. Others depend on \nthe conditions of a given climb. All of these \nare listed on Table 66. \nTable 65: BASE CLIMBING SUCCESS RATES \n-eeorY Success Rate Thief with mountaineering proficiency * \nThief Climb walls % \nMountaineering proficiency \nUnskilled climber 40 % \n* Only if optional proficiency system is used. \nClimb walls % + 10% \n40% + 10% per proficiency slot \nMountaineer (decided by DM) 50% \nTable 66: CLIMBING MODIFIERS \nSituation Modifier \nAbundant handholds \nRope and wall ** +55% \n+40% \nSloped inward +25% \nArmor \nBanded, splint -25% \n-50% Plate armors (all types) \n-15% Scale, chain \nStudded leather, padded -5% \nCharacter race * \nDwarf -10% \nGnome -15% \nHalfling -15% \n(brush, trees, ledges) \n-5%/t Encumbrance \nSurface condition: \nSlightly slippery \nSlippery (icy, slimy) -40% \n- 10% \n(wet or crumbling) -25% \nClimber wounded below 1/z hp \n* These are the same as the modifiers \ngiven in Table 27. Make sure that thief char- \nacters are not penalized twice for race. \nRope and wall applies in most climbing \nsituations in which the character is able to \nbrace his feet against the surface being \nclimbed and use a rope to assist in the task. \nt This is - 5 % per encumbrance category \nabove unencumbered, or per movement \nrate point lost off normal movement rate. \nThe final result of Tables 65 and 66 is the \nnumber the character uses for Climbing \n:becks. A Climbing check is made by rolling \npercentile dice. If the number rolled is equal \nto or less than the number found from Ta- \ndes 65 and 66, the character succeeds with \n:he Climbing check. Rolls above this num- \nxr indicate failure. \nA Climbing check must be made any time \n1 character tries to climb a height of 10 feet \n>r more. This check is made before the char- \nicter ascends the first 10 feet of the climb. If \nhe check is passed, the character can con- \ninue climbing. If the check is failed, the \n:haracter is unable to find a route and can- \nlot even attempt the climb. No further at- \nempts can be made by that character until a \nnhange occurs. This is either a significant \nphange in locati \ndong the face of \nn the character’s \nan unskilled climber. \niuccess is 25% (40% - 15% far being a \npome). She has been cut offfrom the rest of \nhe party by a rugged cliff, 50 feet high. For- \nunately, the cliff is dry and the rock seems \nolid. She makes an attempt, but a 49 is \nolled on the percentile dice. She cannot \n-limb the cliff. Then one of her fnends up \nibove remembers to lower a rope. With the \nope, Brondvrouw can again try the climb, \nince her percentage chance is now 80%. A \n’7 is rolled and she makes the ascent. \nFor example, Bron"
