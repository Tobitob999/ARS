    "text": "I Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nWhispering Wind \n(Alteration, Phantasm) \nRange: 1 mile/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 2-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto either send a message or cause some de- \nsired sound effect. The whispering wind can \ntravel as many miles above ground as the \nspellcaster has levels of experience, to a spe- \ncific location within range that is familiar to \nthe wizard. The whispering wind is as gentle \nand unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches \nthe location. It then delivers its whisper- \nquiet message or other sound. Note that the \nmessage is delivered regardless of whether \nanyone is present to hear it. The wind then \ndissipates. The wizard can prepare the spell \nto bear a message of up to 25 words, cause \nthe spell to deliver other sounds for one \nround, or merely have the whispering wind \nseem to be a faint stirring of the air that has \na susurrant sound. He can likewise cause the \nwhispering wind to move as slowly as a mile \nper hour or as quickly as a mile every turn. \nWhen the spell reaches its objective, it swirls \nand remains until the message is delivered. \nAs with the magic mouth spell, no spells \nmay be cast via the Whispering wind. \nWlzud Lock (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 30 square feet/level \nSaving Throw: None \nA wizard lock spell cast upon a door, \nhest, or portal magically locks it. The \naster can freely pass his own lock without \nffecting it; otherwise, the wizard-locked \nor or object can be opened only by break- \nthe one casting the spell. Note \nother planes cannot burst a wizard lock as \nthey can a held portal (see the hold portal \nspell). \nThird-Level Spells \nBlink (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes \nhis material form to \"blink directly from \none point to another at a random time and \nin a random direction. This means that me- \nlee attacks against the wizard automatically \nmiss if initiative indicates they fall after he \nhas blinked. \nEach round the spell is in effect, the wiz- \nard rolls 2d8 to determine the timing of the \nblink-the result of the dice roll is used as \nthe wizards initiative for that round. The \nwizard disappears and instantaneously re- \nappears 10 feet distant from his previous po- \nsition. (Direction is determined by roll of \nld8: 1 = right ahead, 2 = right, 3 = right \nbehind, 4 = behind, 5 = left behind, 6 = \nleft, 7 left ahead, 8 = ahead.) The caster \ncannot blink into a solid object; if such is in- \ndicated, reroll the direction. Movable ob- \njects of size and mass comparable to the \ncaster are shoved aside when the caster \nblinks in. If blinking is impossible except \ninto a fixed, solid object, the caster is then \ntrapped on the Ethereal plane. \nDuring each round that he blinks, the \nspellcaster can be attacked only by oppo- \nnents who win initiative or by those who are \nable to strike both locations at once (e.g., \nwith a breath weapon, fireball, or similar \nwide-area attack forms). Opponents with \nmultiple attacks, or those operating under \nhaste or similar effects, can often strike \nearly enough to have at least one attack \nagainst the caster. \nIf the spellcaster holds off his attack (if \nany) until after the blink, the 2d8 delay until \nthe blink is added to his normal ldl0 initia- \ntive roll (thus he probably attacks last in the \nround). Or the spellcaster can try to get his \nattack in before he blinks (he must an- \nnounce his intent before rolling the 2de for \nblink timing and the Id10 for initiative). In \nthis case, the caster compares the two dice \nrolls, hoping that his initiative roll is lower \nthan his blink roll (the two rolls are not \nadded if he is trying to attack before he \nblinks). If so, he attacks according to his ini- \ntiative roll, then blinks according to the \nblink roll. If his blink roll is lower than his \ninitiative roll, however, he blinks out, then \nhe attacks in whatever direction he's facing \n(he must go through with his attack, even if \nhe is facing in the wrong direction to affect \nanyone). \nCldraudlencc (Divination) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe clairaudience spell enables the wizard \nto concentrate upon some locale and hear in \nhis mind any noise within a &foot radius \nof the spell's casting point. Distance is not a \nfactor, but the locale must be known-a \nplace familiar to the spellcaster or an obvi- \nous one (such as behind a door, around a \ncorner, in a copse of trees, etc.). Only \nsounds that are normally detectable by the \nwizard can be heard by use of this spell. \nLead sheeting or magical protections pre- \nvent the operation of the spell, and the wiz- \nard has some indication that the spell is so \nblocked. Note that it functions only on the \nwizard's current plane of existence. The \nspell creates an invisible sensor that can be \nmagically dispelled. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall horn of at least 100 gp value. \nClairvoyance (Mvination) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nSimilar to the clairaudience spell, the \nclairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to \nsee in his mind whatever is within sight \nrange from the spell locale chosen. Distance \nfrom the wizard is not a factor, but the lo- \ncale must be known-familiar or obvious. \nFurthermore, light is a factor, as the spell \ndoes not enable the use of infravision or \n147"
