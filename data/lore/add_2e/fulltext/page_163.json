    "text": "Wizard Spells (4th Level) \nJoes it run the risk of changing personality \nand mentality. \nWhen the polymorph occurs, the caster‘s \nequipment, if any, melds into the new form \n(in particularly challenging campaigns, the \nDM may allow protective devices, such as a \nring of protection, to continue operating \neffectively). The caster retains all mental \nabilities, including spell use, assuming the \nnew form allows completion of the proper \nverbal and somatic components and the \nmaterial components are available. A caster \nnot used to a new form might be penalized \nat the DMs option (e.g., -2 penalty to \nattack rolls) until he practices sufficiently to \nmaster it. \nThus a wizard changed into an owl could \nfly, but his vision would be human; a \nchange to a black puddw wodd enable \nmovement under doors or along halls and \nceilings, but not the pudding’s offensive \n(acid) or defensive capabilities. Naturally, \nthe strength of the new form is sufficient to \nenable normal movement. The spellcaster \ncan change his form as often as desired for \nthe duration of the spell, each change \nrequiring a round. The wizard retains his \nown hit points, attack rolls, and saving \nthrows. The wizard can end the spell at any \ntime; when voluntarily returning to his own \nform and ending the spell, he regains Id12 \nhit points. The wizard also will return to his \nown fonn when slain or when the effect is \ndispelled, but no hit points are restored in \nthese cases. \nRillnbow Pattern \n(Alteration, Illusion/Phaatasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizari. Zreates \na glowing, rainbow-hued band of inter- \nweaving patterns. Any creature caught in it \nmay become fascinated and gaze at it as \nlong as the effect lasts. The spell can capti- \nvate a maximum of 24 levels, or Hit Dice, of \ncreatures-24 creatures with 1 Hit Die each, \n12 with 2 Hit Dice, etc. All creatures affect- \ned must be within the area of effect, and \neach is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. \nAn attack on an affected creature that \ncauses damage frees it from the spell imme- \ndiately. Creatures that are restrained and \nremoved from the area still try to follow the \npattern. \nOnce the rainbow pattern is cast, the wiz- \nard need only gesture in the direction he \ndesires, and the pattern of colors moves \nslowly off in that direction, at the rate of 30 \nfeet per round. It persists without further \nattention from the spellcaster for ld3 \nrounds. All affected creatures follow the \nmoving rainbow of light. If the pattern leads \nits subjects into a dangerous area (through \nflame, off a cliff, etc.), allow a second sav- \ning throw. If the view of the lights is com- \npletely blocked (by an obscurement spell, \nfor instance), the spell is negated. \nThe wizard need not utter a sound, but he \nmust gesture appropriately while holding a \ncrystal prism and the material component, a \npiece of phosphor. \nRq’s Mnemonic Enhancer \n(Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto memorize, or retain the memory of, three \nadditional spell levels (three 1st-level spells, \nor one 1st and one 2nd, or one 3rd-level \nspell). The wizard has two options: \nA) Memorize additional spells. This \noption is taken at the time the spell is cast. \nThe additional spells must be memorized \nnormally and any material components \nmust be acquired. \nB) Retain memory of any spell (within the \nlevel limits) cast the round prior to starting \nto cast this spell. The round after a spell is \ncast, the enhancer must be successfully cast. \nThis restores the previously cast spell to \nmemory. Any material components must be \nacquired by the caster, however. \nThe material components of the spell are \na piece of string, an ivory plaque of at least \n100 gp value, and ink consisting of squid \nsecretion with either black dragon’s blood \nor giant slug digestive juice. These disap \npear when the spell is cast. \nRemove Curse (Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard is usu- \nally able to remove a curse-whether it is on \nan object, or a person, or in the form of \nsome undesired sending or evil presence. \nNote that the remove curse spell cannot \naffect a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of \narmor, for example, although it usually \nenables a person afflitted with a cursed item \nto be rid of it. Certain special curses may not \nbe countered by this spell, or may be coun- \ntered only by a caster of a certain level or \n162 \nmore. A caster of 12th level or more can \ncure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it \non the animal form. The were-creature \nreceives a saving throw vs. spell and, if suc- \ncessful, the spell fails and the wizard must \ngain a level before attempting the remedy \nagain. \nThe reverse of the spell is not permanent; \nthe bestow cum lasts for one turn for every \nexperience level of the wizard casting the \nspell. It causes one of the following effects \n(roll percentile dice): \nDlOO \nRoll Result \n1-50 Lowers one ability of the subject to \n3 (the DM determines which by \nrandom selection) \n51-75 Worsens the subject’s attack rolls \nand saving throws by -4 \n76-00 Makes the subject 50% likely per \nturn to drop whatever it is holding \n(or simply do nothing, in the case \nof creatures not using tools) \nIt is possible for a wizard to devise his \nown curse, and it should be similar in power \nto those given (the DM has final say). The \nsubject of a bestow curse spell must be \ntouched. If the subject is touched, a saving \nthrow is still applicable; if it is successful, \nthe effect is negated. The bestowed curse \ncannot be dispelled. \nShadow Monsters (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nA wizard casting the shadow monsters \nspell uses material from the plane of \nShadow to shape semi-real illusions of one \nor more monsters. The total Hit Dice of the \nshadow monster or monsters thus created \ncannot exceed the level of experience of the \nwizard; thus a 10th-level wizard can create \none creature that has 10 Hit Dice, two that \nhave 5 Hit Dice, etc. All shadow monsters \ncreated by one spell must be of the same \nsort. The actual hit point total for each \nmonster is 20% of the hit point total it \nwould normally have. (To determine ’this, \nroll the appropriate Hit Dice and multiply \nthe hit points by .2. Any remainder less than \n.4 is dropped-in the case of monsters with \n1 or fewer Hit Dice, this indicates the mon- \nster was not successfully created-and \nscores between .4 and 1 are rounded up to 1 \nhit point.) \nThose viewing the shadow monsters are \nallowed to disbelieve as per normal illu- \nsions, although there is a -2 penalty to the \nattempt. The shadow monsters perform as \nthe real monsters with respect to Armor \ni \ni"
