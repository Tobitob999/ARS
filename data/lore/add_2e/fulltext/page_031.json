    "text": "Wizard \nThe wizard group \nencompases all spellcasters working in the \nvarious fields of magic-both those who spe- \ncialize in speafic schools of magic and those \nwho study a broad range of magical theories. \nSpending their lives in pursuit of arcane wis- \ndom, wizards have little time for physical \nendeavors. They tend to be poor fighters with \nlittle knowledge of weapoq. However, they \ncommand powerful and dangerous enaes \nwith a few simple gestures, rare components, \nand mystical words. \nSpells are the tools, weapons, and armor \nof the wizard. He is weak in a toe-to-toe \nfight, but when prepared he can strike down \nhis foes at a distance, vanish in an instant, \nbecome a wholly different creature, or even \ninvade the mind of an enemy and take con- \ntrol of his thoughts and actions. No secrets \nare safe from a wizard and no fortress is \nsecure. His quest for knowledge and power \noften leads him into realms where mortals \nwere never meant to go. \nWid cannot wear any armor, for several \nmasons. Firstly, most spells require complicated \n-and oddposturingsby the caster and \namor reshicts the wds ability to do these \n(andwill spend most of his life) learning arcane \nhguages, poring through old books, and prac- \nticing his spells. This leaves no time for learning \notha things (like how to wear armor properly \nand wit effectively). If the wizard had spent \nhis time leaming about armor, he would not \nhave even the meager skills and powers he \n~with.Then?areevenunfoundedtheories \nthadrim thematerialsin most armors disrupt \ntkllrlirdr fabric of a spell as it gakenergy; \ntkiwo cannot exist side by side in harmony. \nWhile this idea is popular with the common \npeople, true wizarck know this is simply not \nhu~.Ifitwem, howwouldtheyeverbeableto \ncast spells mquking iron braziers or metal \nw \nrestricted in the weapons they can use. They \narelimited to those that areeasy to learn or are \nsometimes useful in their own research. \nHence, a wizard can use a dagger or a staff, \nitems that are traditionally useful in magical \nstudies. Other weapons allowed are darts, \nknives, and @ (weapons that require little \nskill, little strength, or both). \nWizards can use more magical items than \nany other characters. These include \npotions, rings, wands, rods, scrolls, and \nmost miscellaneous magical items. A wizard \ncan use a magical version of any weapon \nallowed to his class but cannot use magical \narmor, because no armor is allowed. \nBetween their spells and magical items, \nhowever, wizards wield great power. \nFinally, all wizards khether mages or spe- \ncialists) can create new magical items, ranging \nfrom simple scrolls artd potions to powerful \nprope!rly. ssondly, the wizard spent his youth \nFor simh reasons, wizards are severely \nstaves and magic swords. Once he reaches 9th \nlevel, a wizard can pen magical scrolls and \nbrew potions. He can construct more power- \nful magical items only after behaslearned the \nappropriate spells (or works with someone \nwho knows them). Your DM should codt \nthe Spell Resear& and Magical Items sections \nof the DMG for more information. \nNo matter what school of magic the wiz- \nard is involved in, Intelligence is his prime \nrequisite (or one of several prime requi- \nsites). Characters must have an Intelligence \nscore of at least 9 to qualify to be a wizard. \nAll wizards use Table 20 to determine \ntheir advancement in level as they earn \nexperience points. They also use Table 21 to \ndetermine the levels and numbers of spells \nthey can cast at each experience level. \nAll wizards gain one four-sided Hit Die \n(ld4) per level from 1st through 10th levels. \nAfter loth level, wizards earn 1 hit point per \nlevel and they no longer gain additional hit \npoint bonuses for high Constitution scores. \nTable 21: WIZARD SPELL PROGRESSION \nTable 2(k WIZARD €XPEMENCE LEVELS \nLevel Ma@Spedist €HtDice(rIl) \n1 0 1 \n2 2,500 2 \n3 \n7 60,000 7 \n8 8 \n,---,- \n14 i.SOO.ooO 10+4 \n19 3,375,000 10+9 \n20 3,750,000 lO+lO \n13 5 5 5 4 4 2 - - \n14 5 5 5 4 4 2 1 - - \n- \n20 5 5 5 5 5 4 3 3 2 \nLearning and casting spells require long \nstudy, patience, and research. Once his \nadventuring life begins, a wizard is largely \nresponsible for his own education; he no \nlonger has a teacher looking over his shoul- \nder and telling him which spell to learn next. \nThis freedom is not without its price, how- \never. It means that the wizard must find his \nown source for magical knowledge: \nlibraries, guilds, or captured books and \nscrolls. \nWhenever a wizard discovers instructions \nfor a spell he doesn't know, he can try to \nread and understand the instructions. The \nplayer must roll percentile dice. If the result \nis equal to or less than the percentage chance \nto learn a new spell (listed on Table 4, page \n16), the character understands the spell \n30 \nand how to cast it. He can enter the spell in \nhis spell book (unless he has already learned \nthe maximum number of spells allowed for- \nthat level). If this die roll is higher than the \ncharacter's chance to learn the spell, he \ndoesn't understand the spell. Once a spell is \nlearned, it cannot be unlearned. It remains \npart of that character's repertoire forever. \nThus a character cannot choose to \"forget\" a \nspell so as to replace it with another. \nA wizards spell book can be a single \nbook, a set of books, a bundle of scrolls, or \nanything else your DM allows. The spell \nhook is the wizards diary, laboratory jour- \nnal, and encyclopedia, containing a record \nof everything he knows. Naturally, it is his \nmost treasured possession; without it he is \nalmost helpless."
