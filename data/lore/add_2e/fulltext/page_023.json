If the \nelf must open a door or screen to attack, this \npenalty is reduced to -2. \nElven infravision enables them to see up \nto 60 feet in darkness. \nSecret doors (those constructed so as to \nbe hard to notice) and concealed doors \n(those hidden from sight by screens, cur- \ntains, or the like) are difficult to hide from \nelves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a \nconcealed door gives an elven character a \none-in-six chance (roll a 1 on ld6) to notice \nit. If actively searching for such doors, elven \ncharacters have a one-in-three chance (roll a \n1 or 2 on ld6) to find a secret door and a \none-in-two chance (roll a 1, 2, or 3 on ld6) \nto discover a concealed portal. \nAs stated previously, elven characters \nadd 1 to their initial Dexterity scores. Like- \nwise, as elves are not as sturdy as humans, \nthey deduct 1 from their initial Constitution \nscores. \nGnomes \nKin to dwarves, \nsomes are noticeably smaller than their \ndistant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly \nmaintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. \nTheir noses, however, are significantly \nlarger. Most gnomes have dark tan or \nbrown skin and white hair. A typical gnome \nlives for 350 years. \nGnomes have lively and sly senses of hu- \nmor, especially for practical jokes. They \nhave a great love of living things and finely \nwrought items, particularly gems and jew- \nelry. Gnomes love all sorts of precious \nstones and are masters of gem polishing and \ncutting. \nGnomes prefer to live in areas of rolling, \nrocky hills, well wooded and uninhabited \nby humans. Their diminutive stature has \nmade them suspicious of the larger races- \nhumans and elves-although they are not \nhostile. They are sly and furtive with those \nthey do not know or trust, and somewhat \nreserved even under the best of circum- \nstances. Dwelling in mines and burrows, \nthey are sympathetic to dwarves, but find \ntheir cousins’ aversion to surface dwellers \nfoolish. \nA gnome character can elect to be a \nfighter, a thief, a cleric, or an illusionist. A \ngnome can have two classes, but not three: \nfighter/ thief, illusionist / thief, etc. \nDue to his upbringing, a beginning gnome \ncharacter can choose to know the following \nlanguages, in addition to any others allowed \nby the DM: common, dwarf, gnome, half- \nling, goblin, kobold, and the simple com- \nmon speech of burrowing mammals (moles, \nbadgers, weasels, shrews, ground squirrels, \netc.). The actual number of languages a \ncharacter begins with depends upon his In- \ntelligence score (see Table 4) or the profi- \nciency slots he allots to languages (if that \noptional system is used). \nLike their cousins the dwarves, gnomes \nare highly magic resistant. A gnome player \ncharacter gains a bonus of + 1 for every 3% \npoints of Constitution score, just as \ndwarves do (see Table 9). This bonus ap- \nplies to saving throws against magical \nwands, staves, rods, and spells. \nGnomes also suffer a 20 percent chance \nfor failure every time they use any magical \nitem except weapons, armor, shields, illu- \nsionist items, and (if the character is a thief) \nitems that duplicate thieving abilities. This \ncheck is made each time the gnome attempts \nto use the device or, in the case of \ncontinuous-use devices, each time the de- \nvice is activated. Like dwarves, gnomes can \nsense a cursed item if the device fails to func- \ntion. \nIn melee, gnome characters add 1 to their \nattack rolls to hit kobolds or goblins. When \ngnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, ogre magi, \ngiants, or titans attack gnomes, these mon- \nsters must subtract 4 from their attack rolls \nbecause of the gnomes’ small size and their \ncombat skills against these much larger \ncreatures. \nGnomish infravision enables them to see \nup to 60 feet in the dark. \nBeing tunnelers of exceptional merit, \ngnomes are able to detect the following \nwithin 10 feet (exception: They can deter- \nmine their approximate depth or direction \nunderground at any time.). They must stop \nand concentrate for one round to use any of \nthese abilities. \nDetect grade or slope \nDetect unsafe walls, ceiling, \nDetermine approx. depth \nDetermine approx. direction \nin passage 1-5 on ld6 \nand floors 1-7 on ld10 \nunderground 1-4 on ld6 \nunderground 1-3 on ld6 \nGnome characters gain a +1 bonus to \ntheir Intelligence scores, to reflect their \nhighly inquisitive natures. They suffer a - 1 \npenalty to Wisdom because their curiosity \noften leads them unknowingly into danger. \nHalf-Elves \nHalf-elves are the \nmost common mixed-race beings. The rela- \ntionship between elf, human, and half-elf is \ndefined as follows: 1) Anyone with both el- \nven and human ancestors is either a human \nor a half-elf (elves have only elven ances- \ntors). 2) If there are more human ancestors \nthan elven, the person is human; if there are \nequal numbers or more elves, the person is \nhalf-elven. \nHalf-elves are usually much like their el- \nven parent in appearance. They are hand- \n22 \nsome folk, with the good features of each of \ntheir races. They mingle freely with either \nrace, being only slightly taller than the aver- \nage elf (5 feet 6 inches on average) and \nweighing about 150 pounds. They typically \nlive about 160 years. They do not have all \nthe abilities of the elf, nor do they have the \nflexibility of unlimited level advancement of \nthe human. Finally, in some of the less- \ncivilized nations, half-elves are viewed with \nsuspicion and superstition. \nIn general, a half-elf has the curiosity, in- \nventiveness, and ambition of his human an- \ncestors and the refined senses, love of \nnature, and artistic tastes of his elven ances- \ntors. \nHalf-elves do not form communities \namong themselves; rather, they can be \nfound living in both elven and human com- \nmunities. The reactions of humans and elves \nto half-elves ranges from intrigued fascina- \ntion to outright bigotry. \nOf all the demihuman races, half-elves \nhave the greatest range of choices in charac- \nter class. They tend to make good druids \nand rangers. A half-elf can choose to be a \ncleric, druid, fighter, ranger, mage, special- \nist wizard, thief, or bard. In addition, a half- \nelf can choose from the following \nmulti-class combinations: cleric (or druid)/ \nfighter, cleric (or druid)/fighter/mage, \ncleric (or druid)/ranger, cleric (or druid)/ \nmage, fighter/mage, fighterhhief, fighter/ \nmage/thief, and magelthief. The half-elf \nmust abide by the rules for multi-class char- \nacters. \nHalf-elves do not have a language of their \nown. Their extensive contact with other \nraces enables them to choose any of the fol- \nlowing languages (plus any other allowed \nby the DM): common, elf, gnome, halfling, \ngoblin, hobgoblin, orc, and gnoll. The ac- \ntual number of languages the character \nknows is limited by his Intelligence (see Ta- \nble 4) or by the number of proficiency slots \nhe allots to languages (if that optional sys- \ntem is used). \nHalf-elven characters have a 30 percent \nresistance to sleep and all charm-related \nspells. \nHalf-elven infravision enables them to see \nup to 60 feet in darkness. \nSecret or concealed doors are difficult to \nhide from half-elves, just as they are from \nelves. Merely passing within 10 feet of a \nconcealed door (one hidden by obstructing \ncurtains, etc.) gives the half-elven character \na one-in-six chance (roll a 1 on ld6) of spot- \nting it. If the character is actively seeking to \ndiscover hidden doors, he has a one-in-three \nchance (roll a 1 or 2 on ld6) of spotting a se- \ncret door (one constructed to be undetect- \nable) and a one-in-two chance (roll a 1,2, or \n3 on ld6) of locating a concealed door."
