    "text": "Priest Spells (1 st Level) \n- -mand (Enchantment/Charm) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: 30 yards \nComponent: V \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Tithe: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the priest to command \nanother creature with a single word. The \ncommand must be uttered in a language un- \nderstood by the creature. The subject will \nobey to the best of hidits ability only as \nlong as the command is absolutely clear and \nunequivocal; hence, a command of “Sui- \ncide!” is ignored. A command to ”Die!” \ncauses the creature to fall in a faint or cata- \nleptic state for one round, but thereafter the \ncreature revives and is alive and well. Typi- \ncal commands are back, halt, flee, run, \nstop, fall, go, leave, surrender, sleep, rest, \netc. No command affects a creature for \nmore than one round; undead are not af- \nfected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of \n13 (high) or more, or those with 6 or more \nHit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to \na saving throw vs. spell, adjusted for Wis- \ndom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelli- \ngence and 6 Hit DiceAevels get only one \nsaving throw!) \nCreate Water (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Water) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Up to 27 cubic feet \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the priest casts a create water spell, \nup to four gallons of water are generated for \nevery experience level of the caster (e.g., a \n2nd-level priest creates up to eight gallons of \nwater, a 3rd-level up to 12 gallons, etc.). \nThe water is clean and drinkable (it is just \nlike rain water). The created water can be \ndispelled within a round of its creation, oth- \nerwise its magic fades, leaving normal water \nthat can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc. \nReversing the spell, destroy water, obliter- \nates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or \nsteam) a like quantity of water. Water can \nbe created or destroyed in an area as small \nas will actually contain the liquid, or in an \narea as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard). \nThe spell requires at least a drop of water \nto create, or a pinch of dust to destroy, water. \nNote that water can neither be created \nnor destroyed within a creature. For refer- \nence purposes, water weighs about 8 % \npounds per gallon, and a cubic foot of water \nweighs approximately 64 pounds. \nCure Light Wounds (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen casting this spell and laying his \nhand upon a creature, the priest causes Id8 \npoints of wound or other injury damage to \nthe creature’s body to be healed. This heal- \ning cannot affect creatures without corpo- \nreal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of \ncreatures not living or of extraplanar origin. \nThe reversed spell, cause light wounds, \noperates in the same manner, inflicting Id8 \npoints of damage. If a creature is avoiding \nthis touch, an attack roll is needed to deter- \nmine if the priest’s hand strikes tht oppo- \nnent and causes such a wound. \nCuring is permanent only insofar as the \ncreature does not sustain further damage; \ncaused wounds will heal-or can be cured- \njust as any normal injury. \nDetect Evil (Divination) \nReversible \nSphere: All \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 10-foot path \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell discovers emanations of evil, or \nof good in the case of the reverse spell, from \nany creature, object, or area. Character \nalignment, however, is revealed only under \nunusual circumstances: characters who are \nstrongly aligned, who do not stray from \ntheir faith, and who are of at least 9th level \nmight radiate good or evil if intent upon ap- \npropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such \nas rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emana- \ntions of evil or good, even if polymorphed. \nAligned undead radiate evil, for it is this \npower and negative force that enable them \nto continue existing. An evilly cursed object \nor unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden \ntrap or an unintelligent viper does not. \nThe degree of evil (faint, moderate, \nstrong, overwhelming) and possibly its gen- \neral nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, \netc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelm- \ning, the priest has a 10% chance per level of \ndetecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, \nchaotic). The duration of a detect ail (or \ndetect good) spel1 is one turn plus five \nrounds per level of the priest. Thus a priest \nof 1st experience level can cast a spell with a \n15-round duration, at 2nd level he can cast a \n20-round duration spell, etc \n1 99 \ni.0 \npath of detection 10 feet wide in the direc- \ntion in which the priest is facing. The priest \nmust concentrate-stop, have quiet, and in- \nDetect Magic (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 30 yards \nCotlnponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 10-foot path \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the detect magic \nate, strong, overwhelming). The caster has \na 10% chance per level to determine the \nsphere of the magic, but unlike the wiwd \nthickness, solid metal of \nholy symbol. \nDetect Polson (Divjnatlon) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 roun \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \npoison is present."
