    "text": "Wizard Spells (2nd Level) \nStr teration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Person touched \nSaving Throw: None \nApplication of this spell increases the \nStrength of the character by a number of \npoints-or tenths of points after 18 Strength \nis attained (only if the character is a war- \nrior). Benefits of the strength spell last for \nthe duration of the magic. The amount of \nadded Strength depends upon the spell re- \ncipient‘s group and is subject to all restric- \ntions on Strength due to race and class. \nMulti-class characters use the best die. \nClaSS Strength Gain \nPriest ld6 points \nRogue ld6 points \nWarrior ld8 points \nWizard ld4 points \nIf a warrior has an 18 Strength already, \nfrom 10% to 80% is added to his extraordi- \nnary Strength roll. The spell cannot confer a \nStrength of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative \nwith other magic that adds to Strength. Be- \nings without Strength scores (kobolds, liz- \nard men, etc.) receive a +1 to attack and \ndamage rolls. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nfew hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a partic- \nularly strong animal-ape, bear, ox, etc. \nSummon Swum \n(ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe swarm of small animals (roll on fol- \nlowing table to determine type, or the DM \ncan assign an appropriate creature) drawn \nby the summon mum spell will viciously \nattack all creatures in the area chosen by the \ncaster. Creatures actively defending against \nthe swarm to the exclusion of other activi- \nr 1 point of damage for each round \nthe swarm. Those taking other \nincluding leaving the swarm, re- \ne equal to ld4 points + 1 point \nvels of the caster, every round. \nlcasting ’within the swarm is \nDice Roll Swarm Type \n01-40 Rats \n41-70 Bats \nn-80 Spiders \n81-90 Centipededbeetles \n91-100 Flying insects \nThe swarm cannot be fought effectively \nwith weapons, but fire and area effects can \nforce it to disperse by inflicting damage. \nThe swarm disperses when it has taken a to- \ntal of 2 hit points per caster level from these \nattacks. A protection from evil spell keeps \nthe swarm at bay, and certain area-effect \nspells, such as gust of wind and stinking \ncloud, disperse a swarm immediately, if ap- \npropriate to the swarm summoned (e.g., \nonly flyers are affected by a gust of wind). \nThe caster must remain stationary and un- \ndisturbed to control the swm; if his con- \ncentration lapses or is broken, the swarm \ndisperses in two rounds. The swarm is sta- \ntionary once conjured. \nThe material component is a square of red \ncloth. \nTasha’s Uncontrollable Hideous \nLaughter (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a \n%foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe victim of this spell perceives every- \nthing as hilariously funny. The effect is not \nimmediate, and the creature feels only a \nslight tingling on the round the spell is cast. \nOn the round immediately following, the \nvictim begins smiling, then giggling, chuck- \nling, tittering, snickering, guffawing, and fi- \nnally collapsing into gales of \nuncontrollable, hideous laughter. Although \nthis magical mirth lasts only a single round, \nthe affected creature must spend the next \nround regaining its feet, and it loses 2 points \nfrom its Strength (or -2 to attack and dam- \nage rolls) for all remaining rounds of the \nspell. \nThe saving throw vs. spell is modified by \nthe Intelhgence of the creature. Creatures \nwith Intelligences of 4 or less (semi- \nintelligent) are totally unaffected. Those \nwith Intelligences of 5-7 (low) save with -6 \npenalties. Those with Intelligences of 8-12 \n(average to very) save with -4 penalties. \nThose with Intelligences of 13-14 (high) save \nwith -2 penalties. Those with Intelligences \nof 15 or greater (exceptional) have unmodi- \nfied saving throws. \nThe caster can affect one creature for ev- \nery three levels attained-e.g., one at 3rd \nlevel, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, etc. \nAll affected beings must be within 30 feet of \neach other. \nThe material components are a small \nfeather and minute tarts. The tarts are \nhurled at the subjects, while the feather is \nwaved in one hand. \nWeb (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 turndlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. or */z \nA web spell creates a many-layered mass \nof strong, sticky strands similar to spider \nwebs but far larger and tougher. These \nmasses must be anchored to two or more \nsolid and diametrically opposed points- \nfloor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc., or the \nweb collapses upon itself and disappears. \nThe we& spell covers a maximum area of \neight 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cubes and the webs must \nbe at least 10 feet thick, so a mass 40 feet \nhigh, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet deep may be \ncast. Creatures caught within webs, or sim- \nply touching them, become stuck among the \ngluey fibers. \nAnyone in the area when the spell is cast \nmust roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 \npenalty. If the saving throw is successful, \ntwo things may have occurred. If the crea- \nture has room to escape the area, then it is \nper round. If the webs \nthese rates are doubled \nto great strength in thi \nof large mass hardly notice webs.) Strong \nand huge creatures can break through 10 \nfeet of webs per round. \nFurthermore, the strands of a we& spell \nare flammable. A magical flaming sword \ncan slash them away as easily as a hand \nbrushes away cobwebs. Any fire-torch, \nflaming oil, flaming sword, etc.-can set \nthem alight and burn them away in a single \nround. All creatures within flaming webs \nsuffer 2d4 points of damage from the \nflames, but those free of the strands are not \nharmed. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nbit of spider web. \n146"
