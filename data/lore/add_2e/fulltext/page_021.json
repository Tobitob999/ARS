    "text": "I Chapter 2: Player Character Races \nAfter creating your character's ability \nscores, you must select a player character \nrace. This is not a race in the true sense of \nthe word: Caucasian, black, asian, etc. It is \nactually a fantasy species for your \ncharacter-human, elf, dwarf, gnome, half- \nelf, or halfling. Each race is different. Each \npossesses special powers and has different \nlists of classes to choose from. \nAll six of the standard races are described \nin detail in this chapter. In many cases, \nbroad statements are made concerning the \nrace in general. Players are not bound by \nthese generalities. For example, the state- \nment that \"dwarves tend to be dour and tac- \niturn\" does not mean that your character \ncannot be a jolly dwarf. It means that the \ngarden-variety dwarf is dour and taciturn. \nIf player characters were just like everyone \nelse, they wouldn't be adventurers. Make \nyour character unique and he will be more \nfun to play. \nMinimum and Maximum \nAbility Scores \nAll non-human PC \nraces (also called \"demihuman\" races) have \nminimum and maximum requirements for \ntheir ability scores. If you want to have a de- \nmihuman character, the character's ability \nscores must be within the allowable range. \nThe minimums and maximums for each race \nare listed on Table 7 (the minimums are \nlisted before the slash; the maximums are \nlisted after the slash). Your character's sex \nhas no effect on these minimums or maxi- \nmums. \nConsult Table 7 before making any racial \nadjustments to your character's ability \nscores. If the basic scores that you rolled up \nmeet the requirements for a particular race, \nyour character can be of that race, even if \nlater modifications change the ability scores \nso they exceed the maximums or don't meet \nthe minimums. Once you satisfy the re- \nquirements at the start, you never have to \nwony &aut dmn again. \nTable 7 gives the minimum and maximum \nscores a newly created character must have \nto be a member of a demihuman race. Any \ncharacter can be a human, if the player so \ndesires. \nRacial Ability AdJustments \nIf you chose to \nmake your character a dwarf, elf, gnome, or \nhalfling, you now have to adjust some of \nyour character's ability scores. The adjust- \nments are mandatory; all characters of these \nraces receive the adjustments. Even if ad- \njustments raise or lower your character's \nability scores beyond the minimums and \nmaximums shown on Table 7, you do not \nhave to pick a new race. The adjustments \ncan also raise a score to 19 or lower it to 2. \nTable 8: RACIAL ABILITY \nRace Adjustments \nDwarf + 1 Constitution; - 1 Charisma \nElf +1 Dexterity; -1 Constitution \nGnome + 1 Intelligence; - 1 Wisdom \nHalfling +1 Dexterity; -1 Strength \nADJUSTMENTS \nClass Restrlctions and Level Limits \nThe human race \nhas one special ability in the AD&D@ game: \nHumans can choose to be of any class- \nwarrior, wizard, priest, or rogue-and can \nrise to great level in any class. The other \nraces have fewer choices of character classes \nand usually are limited in the level they can \nattain. These restrictions reflect the natural \ntendencies of the races (dwarves like war \nand fighting and dislike magic, etc.). The \nlimits are high enough so a demihuman can \nachieve power and importance in at least \none class. A halfling, for example, can be- \ncome the best thief in the land, but he can- \nnot become a great fighter. \nThe limits also exist for play balance. The \nability of humans to assume any role and \nreach any level is their only advantage. The \ndemihuman races have other powers that \nmake them entertaining to play- \nparticularly the ability to be multi-classed \n(see Glossary). These powers balance the \nenjoyment of play against the ability to rise \nin level. Ask your DM for the level limits \nimposed on non-human characters. \nTable 7: RACIAL ABILITY REQUIREMENTS \nAbility Dwarf Elf Gnome Half-Elf Halfling \nStrength 8/18 3/18 6/18 3/18 7/18 \nDexteritv 3/17 6/18 3/18 6/18 7/18 \n10/18 \n6/18 \n3/17 \n3/17 8/18 3/18 3/18 3/18 \nHalfling fighters do not roll for exceptional Strength. \n20 \nLanguages \nRacial languages \nfor demihumans can be handled in either of \ntwo ways, depending on whether or not \nyour DM uses the optional proficiency sys- \ntem. Either way, your character automati- \ncally knows his native language. \nWithout the proficiency system, your \ncharacter starts adventuring already know- \ning a number of additional languages (the \nnumber depends on his Int score, see Table \n4). The additional languages must be chosen \nfrom among those listed in his race's de- \nscrip tion. \nHuman PCs generally start the game \nknowing only their regional language-the \nlanguage they grew up speaking. The DM \nmay decide to allow beginning PCs addi- \ntional languages (up to their Int score limit \nor proficiency slot limit), if he feels the PCs \nhad the opportunity to learn these as they \ngrew up. Otherwise, human PCs may learn \nadditional languages as they adventure. \nDwarves \nDwarves are short, \nstocky fellows, easily identified by their size \nand shape. They average 4 to 4% feet tall. \nThey have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and \ndark hair. Dwarves generally live for 350 \nyears. \nDwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. \nThey are given to hard work and care little \nfor most humor. They are strow and brave. \nThey enjoy beer, ale, mead, and even \nstronger drink. Their chief love, however, is \nprecious metal, particularly gold. They \nprize gems, of course, especially diamonds \nand opaque gems (except pearls, which they \ndo not like). Dwarves like the earth and dis- \nlike the sea. Not overly fond of elves, they \nhave a fierce hatred of orcs and goblins. \nTheir short, stocky builds make them ill- \nsuited for riding horses or other large \nmounts (although ponies present no diffi- \nculty), so they tend to be a trifle dubious \nand wary of these creatures. They are ill- \ndisposed toward magic and have little talent \nfor it, but revel in fighting, warcraft, and \nscientific arts such as engineering. \nThough dwarves are suspicious and ava- \nricious, their courage and tenacity more \nthan compensate for these shortcomings. \nI \nI"
