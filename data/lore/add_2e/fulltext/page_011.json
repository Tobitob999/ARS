    "text": "I The Real Basics \nup your character record. \nMiniature figures are handy for keeping \ntrack of where everyone is in a confusing sit- \nuation like a battle. These can be as elabo- \nrate or simple as you like. Some players use \nminiature lead or pewter figures painted to \nresemble their characters. Plastic soldiers, \nchess pieces, boardgame pawns, dice, or \nbits of paper can work just as well. \nAn Example of Play \nTo further clarify \nwhat really goes on during an AD&W \ngame, read the following example. This is \ntypical of the sort of action that occurs dur- \ning a playing session. \nShortly before this example begins, three \nplayer characters fought a skirmish with a \nwererat (a creature similar to a werewolf \nbut which becomes an enormous rat instead \nof a wolf). The wererat was wounded and \nfled down a tunnel. The characters are in \npursuit. The group includes two fighters \nand a cleric. Fighter 1 is the group’s leader. \nDM: You’ve been following this tunnel for \nabout 120 yards. The water on the floor \nis ankle deep and very cold. Now and \nthen you feel something brush against \nyour foot. The smell of decay is getting \nstronger. The tunnel is gradually filling \nwith a cold mist. \nFighter 1: I don’t like this at all. Can we see \nanything up ahead that looks like a door- \nway, or a branch in the tunnel? \nDM: Within the range of your torchlight, \nthe tunnel is more or less straight. You \ndon‘t see any branches or doorways. \nCleric: The wererat we hit had to come this \nway. There’s nowhere else to go. \nFighter 1: Unless we missed a hidden door \nalong the way. I hate this place; it gives \nme the creeps. \nFighter 2: We have to track down that were- \nrat. I say we keep going. \nighter 1: OK. We keep moving down the \ntunnel. But keep your eyes open for any- \nthing that might be a door. \nM: Another 30 or 35 yards down the tun- \nyou find a stone block on the floor. \n1: A block? I take a closer look. \ns a cut block, about 12 by 16 inches, \n18 inches or so high. It looks like a \nerenf kind of rock than the rest of the \nghter 2: Where is it? Is it in the center of \nthe tunnel or off to the side? \n: It’s right up against the side. \nFighter 1: Can I move it? \nDM (checking the character’s Strength \nscore): Yeah, you can push it around \nwithout too much trouble. \nFighter 1: Hmmm. This is obviously a \nmarker of some sort. I want to check this \narea for secret doors. Spread out and \nexamine the walls. \nDM (rolls several dice behind his rule book, \nwhere players can’t see the results): \nNobody fiids anything unusual along \nthe walls. \nFighter 1: It has to be here somewhere. \nWhat about the ceiling? \nDM: You can’t reach the ceiling. It‘s about a \nfoot beyond your reach. \nCleric: Of course! That block isn’t a marker, \nit’s a step. I climb up on the block and \nstart prodding the ceiling. \nDM (rolling a few more dice): You poke \naround for 20 seconds or so, then sud- \ndenly part of the tunnel roof shifts. \nYou‘ve found a panel that lifts away. \nFighter 1: Open it very carefully. \nCleric: I pop it up a few inches and push it \naside slowly. Can I see anything? \nDM: Your head is still below the level of the \nopening, but you see some dim light \nfrom one side. \nFighter 1: We boost him up so he can get a \nbetter look. \nDM: OK, your friends boost you up into the \nroom. . . \nFighter 1: No, no! We boost him just high \nenough to get his head through the open- \ning. \nDM: OK, you boost him up a foot. The two \nof you are each holding one of his legs. \nCleric, you see another tunnel, pretty \nmuch like the one you were in, but it \nonly goes off in one direction. There‘s a \ndoorway about 10 yards away with a \nsoft light inside. A line of muddy \npawprints leads from the hole you‘re in \nto the doorway. \nCleric: Fine. I want the fighters to go first. \nDM: As they‘re lowering you back to the \nblock, everyone hears some grunts, \nsplashing, and clanking weapons coming \nfrom further down the lower tunnel. \nThey seem to be closing fast. \nCleric: Up! Up! Push me back up through \nthe hole! I grab the ledge and haul myself \nup. I’ll help pull the next guy up. \n(All three characters scramble up through \nthe hole.) \nDM: What about the panel? \nFighter 1: We push it back into place. \nDM: It slides back into its slot with a nice, \nloud ”clunk.” The grunting from below \ngets a lot louder. \nFighter 1: Great, they heard it. Cleric, get \nover here and stand on this panel. We’re \ngoing to check out that doorway. \nDM: Cleric, you hear some shouting and \nshuffling around below you, then there’s \na thump and the panel you’re standing \non lurches. \n3eric: They’re trying to batter it open! \n3M (t4 the, fighters): When you peer around \nthedoorway, you see a small, dirty room \nall cot, a table, and a couple of \nstools with On the cot is a wererat curled up \ninto a ball. Its back is toward you. \nThere‘s another door in the far wall and a \n10 \nsmall gong in the corner. \nFighter 1: Is the wererat moving? \nDM: Not a bit. Cleric, the panel just \nthumped again. You can see a little crack \nin it now. \nCleric: Do something quick, you guys. \nWhen this panel starts coming apart, I’m \ngetting off it. \nFighter 1: OK already! I step into the room \nand prod the wererat with my shield. \nWhat happens? \nDM: Nothing. You see blood on the cot. \nFighter 1: Is this the same wererat we fought \nbefore? \nDM: Who knows? All wererats look the \nsame to you. Cleric, the panel thumps \nagain. That crack is looking really big. \nCleric: That’s it. I get off the panel. I’m mov- \ning into the room with everybody else. \nDM: There‘s a tremendous smash and you \nhear chunks of rodc banging around out \nin the corridor, followed by kits of snarl- \ning and squeaking. You see flashes of \ntorchlight and wererat shadows through \nthe doorway. \nFighter 1: All right, the other fighter and I \nmove up to block the doorway. That’s \nthe narrowest area, they can only come \nthrough it one or two at a time. Cleric, \nyou stay in the room and be ready with \nyour spells. \nFighter 2: At last, a decent, stand-up fight! \nDM: As the first wererat appears in the \ndoorway with a spear in his paws, you \nhear a slam behind you. \nCleric: I spin around. What is it? \nDM: The door in the back of the room is \nbroken off its hinges. Standing in the \ndoorway, holding a mace in each paw, is \nthe biggest, ugliest wererat you’ve ever \nseen. A couple more pairs of red eyes are \nshining through the darkness behind \nhim. He’s licking his chops in a way that \nyou find very unsettling. \nCleric: Aaaaarrrgh! I scream the name of \nmy deity at the top of my lungs and then \nflip over the cot with the dead wererat on \nit so the body lands in front of him. I’ve \ngot to have some help here, guys. \nFighter 1 (to fighter 2): Help him, I’ll handle \nthis end of the room. (To DM): I’m \nattacking the wererat in the doorway. \nDM: While fighter 2 is switching positions, \nthe big wererat looks at the body on the \nfloor and his jaw drops. He looks back \nup and says, ”That‘s Ignatz. He was my \nbrother. You killed my brother.” Then he \nraises both maces and leaps at you. \nAt this point a ferocious melee breaks \nout. The DM uses the combat rules to play \nout the battle. If the characters survive, they \ncan continue on whatever course they \nchoose. \nI 1"
