The recipient \nof the spell remains in the new plane until \nsent forth by some like means. If several \npersons link hands in a circle, up to eight \ncan be affected by the plane shift at the same \ntime. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall, forked metal rod-the exact size and \nmetal type dictating to which plane of exist- \nence (including sub-planes and alternate \ndimensions) the spell sends the affected \ncreatures. (Your DM will determine specifics \nregarding how and what planes are \nreached.) \nAn unwilling victim must be touched \n(successful attack roll) in order to be sent; in \naddition, the creature is also allowed a sav- \ning throw. If the saving throw is successful, \nthe effect of the spell is negated. Note that \npinpoint accuracy is rarely achieved; arriv- \ning a random distance from an intended des- \ntination is common. \nThc metal rod is not expended when the \nspell is cast. Forked rods keyed to certain \nD~WS mav be difficult to come bv, as decid- \nQuest (EnebnnhnenVChann) \nSphere: Charm \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Until fulfilled \nCasring Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe quest spell enables the priest to \nrequire the affected creature to perform a \nservice and return to the priest with proof \nthat the deed was accomplished. The quest \ncan, for example, require that the creature \nlocate and return some important or valu- \nable object, rescue a notkble person, release \nsome creature, capture a stronghold, slay a \nperson, deliver some item, and so forth. If \nthe quest is not properly followed, due to \ndhmgard, delay, or perversion, the creature \naffected by the spell loses 1 from its saving \nthrow rolls for each day of such action. This \npenalty is not removedantil the quest is \nproperly pursued or the priest cancels it. \nmre are certain circumstances that will \ntemporarily suspend a quest, and others \nthat will discharsx or cancel it: vour DM \nRall$e: 60 yards \nneed to know arises.) \nIf cast upon an unwilling subject, the vic- \ntim is allowed a saving throw. However if \nthe person quested agrees to a task, even if \nthe agreement is gained by force or trickery, \nno saving throw is allowed. If a quest is just \nand deserved, a creature of the priest’s reli- \ngion cannot avoid it, and any mature of the \npriest’s alignment saves with a -4 penalty \nto the saving throw, in any case. A quest \ncannot be dispelled but can be removed by a \npriest of the same religion or of higher level \nthan the caster. Some artifacts and relics \nmight negate the spell, as can direct inter- \nvention by a deity. Likewise, an unjust or \nundeserved quest grants bonuses to its sav- \ning throws, or might even automatically \nfail! \nThe material component of this spell is \nthe priest’s holy symbol. \nRainbow (Evocation, Alteration) \nSphere: Weather, Sun \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nIn order to cast this spell, the priest must \nbe in sight of a rainbow of any sort, or have \na special component (see below). The rain- \nbow spell has two applications, and the \npriest can choose the desired one at the time \nof casting. These applications are as fol- \nlows: \nBow The spell creates a shimmering, \nmulti-layered short composite bow of rain- \nbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that \nany character can use it without penalty for \nnon-proficiency. It is magical: Each of its \nshimmering missiles is the equivalent of a \n+2 weapon, including attack and damage \nbonuses. Magic resistance can negate the \neffect of any missile fired from the bow. The \nbow fires seven missiles before disappear- \ning. It can be fired up to four times per \nround. Each time a missile is fired, one hue \nleaves the bow, corresponding to the color \nof arrow that is released. Each color of \narrow has the ability to cause double dam- \nage to certain creatures, as follows: \nRed-firedwellerdusers and fire elementals \nOrange-creatures or constructs of clay, \nsand, earth, stone or similar mate- \nrials, and earth elementals \nYellow-vegetable opponents (including \nfungus creatures, shambling \nmounds, treants, etc.) \nGreen-aquatic creatures and water ele- \nmentals \nBlue-aerial creatures, electricity-using \ncreatures, and air elementals. \nIndigo-acid-using or poison-using crea- \ntures \n224 -7 \nViolet-metallic or regenerating creatures \nWhen the bow is drawn, an arrow of the \nappropriate color magically appears, \nnocked and ready. If no color is reqwsted, \nor a color that has already been used is \nasked for, then the next arrow (in the order \nof the spectrum) appears. \nBridge: The caster causes the rainbow to \nform a seven-hued bridge up to three feet \nwide per level of the caster. It must be at \nleast 20 feet long syld can be as long as 1u) \nyards, according to the caster‘s desire. It \nlasts as long as the spell duration or until \nordered out of existence by the caster. \nThe components for this spell are the \npriest’s holy symbol and a vial of holy \nwater. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the \ncaster can substitute a diamond of not less \nthan LOO0 gp value, specially prepared with \nbless and prpyer spells while in sight of a \nrainbow. The holy water and diamond dis- \nappear when the spell is cast. \nRaise Dead (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Necromantic \nR-w: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration; Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 person \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen the priest casts a raise dud spdl, he \ncan restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-&, \nhalfling, or human (other creatures may be \nallowed, at the DMs option). The length of \ntime that the person has been dead is of \nimportance, as the priest can raise persons \ndead only up to a limit of one day for each \nexperience level of the priest (i.e., a 9th- \nlevel priest can raise a person who has been \ndead for up to nine days). \nNote that the body of the person must be \nwhole, or otherwise missii parts are still \nmissing when the person is brought back to \nlife. Likewise, other ills, such as poison and \ndisease, are not negated. The raised person \nmust roll a SUU resurrection survival \ncheck to Survive the ordeal (see Table 3: \nConstitution) and loses 1 point of Constitu- \ntion. Furthermore, the raised puson \nand helpless in any event, and he needs a \nminimum of one full day of rest in bed for \neach day or fraction he was dead. The per- \nson has but 1 hit point when raised and must \nregain the rest by natural healing or curative \nmagic. \nNote that a character’s starting Constitu- \ntion is an absohte limit to the number of \ntimes the character can be revived by this \nmeans. \nThe somatic component of the spell is a \npointed finger. \nThe reverse of the spell, slay living,"
