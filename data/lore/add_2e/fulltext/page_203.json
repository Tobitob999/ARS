    "text": "I.f.2 Priest Spells (2nd Level) \nattacks require touching the protected crea- \nture. Animals or monsters summoned or \nconjured by spells or similar magic are like- \nwise hedged from the character. This pro- \ntection ends if the protected character \nmakes a melee attack against or tries to \nforce the barrier against the blocked crea- \nture. \nTo complete this spell, the priest uses holy \nwater or burning incense. \nThis spell can be reversed to become pro- \ntection from good; the second and third \nbenefits remain unchanged. \nThe material components forsthe reverse \nare a circle of unholy water or smoldering \ndung. \nMty Food b Mnk (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: All \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level, \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen cast, this spell makes spoiled, rot- \nten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated \nfood and water pure and suitable for eating \nand drinking. Up to bne cubic foot of food \nand drink per level can be thus made suit- \nable for consumption. This spell does not \nprevent subsequent natural decay or spoil- \nage. Unholy water and similar food and \ndrink of significance is spoiled by purify \nfood and drink, but the spell has no effect on \ncreatures of any type nor upon magical \npotions. \nThe reverse of the spell is putrefy food \nand drink. This spoils even holv water. It \n1Ckfoot-square area \nlikewise has no r \npotions. \nRemove Fear (Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Charm \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, 5 \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature/4 levels \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe priest instills courage in the spell \nredpient, raising the creature‘s saving throw \nrolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for \none turn. If the recipient has recently (that \nday) failed a saving throw against such an \nattack, the spell immediately grants another \nsaving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die \nroll. For every four levels of the caster, one \ncreature can be affected by the spell (one \ncreature at levels 1 through 4, two creatures \nat levels 5 through 8, etc.). \nThe reverse of the spell, cause fear, causes \none creature to flee in panic at maximum \nmovement speed away from the caster for, \nld4 rounds. A successful saving throw \nagainst the reversed effect negates it, and \nany Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of \ncourse, cause fear can be automatically \ncountered by remove fear and vice versa. \nNeither spell has any effect on undead of \nany sort. \nSanctuary (Abjuration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the priest casts a sanctuary spell, \nany opponent attempting to strike or other- \nwise directly attack the protected creature \nmust roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the sav- \ning throw is successful, the opponent can \nattack normally and is unaffected by that \ncasting of the spell. If the saving throw is \nfailed, the opponent loses track of and total- \nly ignores the warded creature for the dura- \ntion of the spell. Those not attempting to \nattack the subject remain unaffected. Note \nthat this spell does not prevent the opera- \ntion of area attacks (fireball, ice storm, \netc.). While protected by this spell, the sub- \nject cannot take direct offensive action with- \nout breaking the spell, but may use \nnon-attack spells or otherwise act in any \nway that does not violate the prohibition \nagainst offensive action. This allows a \nwarded priest to heal wounds, for example, \nor to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a \nlight in the area (not upon an opponentl), \nand so on. \nThe components of the spell include the \npriest’s holy symbol and a small silver mir- \nror. \nShillelagh (Alteration) \nSphere: Combat, Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration:. 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 normal oaken club \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to change his \nown oaken cudgel or unshod staff into a \nmagical weapon that gains a + 1 bonus to its \nattack roll and inflicts 2d4 points of damage \non opponents up to man-sized, and Id4 + 1 \npoints of damage on larger opponents. The \nspell infIicts no damage to the staff or cud- \ngel. The caster must wield the shillelagh, of \n202 \ncourse. \nThe material components of this spell are \na shamrock leaf and the caster’s holy sym- \nbol. \nSecond-Level Spells \nAid (Necromancy, Conjuration) \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe recipient of this spell gains the benettt \nof a bless spell ( + 1 to attack rolls and saving \nthrows) and a special bonus of Id8 addition- \nal hit points for the duration of the spell. \nThe aid spell enables the recipient to actu- \nally have more hit points than his full nor- \nmal total. m bonus hit points are lost first \nwhen the recipient takes damage; they can- \nnot be regained by curative magic. Exam- \nple; A 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, \nsuffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), and \nthen receives an aid spell that gives 5 addi- \ntional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit \npoints, 5 of which are temporary. If he is \nthen hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit \npoints and all 5 temporary hit points are \nlost. He then receives a cure light wounds \nspell that heals 4 points of damage, restor- \ning him to his original 8 hit points. \nNote that the operation of the spell is \nunaffected by permanent hit point losses \ndue to energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss \nof a familiar, or the operation of certain arti- \nfacts; the temporary hit point gain is fii \nfrom the new, lower total. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky sub- \nstance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus \nthe priest’s holy symbol."
