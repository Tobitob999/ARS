    "text": "useful to priest characters when dealing \nwith their own and rival faiths. \nRiding, Airborne: The character is trained \nin handling a flying mount. The particular \ncreature must be chosen when the proficien- \ncy is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can \nbe used to learn how to handle other types of \nmounts. Unlike land-based riding, a charac- \nter must have this proficiency (or ride with \nsomeone who does) to handle a flying \nmount. In addition, a proficient character \ncan do the following: \n* Leap onto the saddle of the creature \n(when it is standing on the ground) and spur \nit airborne as a single action. This requires \nno proficiency check. \n* Leap from the back of the mount and \ndrop 10 feet to the ground or onto the back \nof another mount (land-based or flying). \nThose with only light encumbrance can \ndrop to the ground without a proficiency \ncheck. In all other situations, a proficiency \ncheck is required. A failed roll means the \ncharacter takes normal falling damage (for \nfalling flat on his face) or misses his target \n(perhaps taking large amounts of damage as \na result). A character who is dropping to the \nground can attempt an immediate melee \nattack, if his proficiency check is made with \na -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure has \nthe consequences given above. \nSpur his mount to greater speeds on a \nsuccessful check, adding ld4 to the move- \nment rate of the mount. This speed can be \nmaintained for four consecutive rounds. If \nthe check fails, an attempt can be made \nagain the next round. If two checks fail, no \nattempt can be made for a full turn. After \nthe rounds of increased speed, its movement \ndrops to 2/3 its normal rate and its Maneu- \nverability Class (see Glossary) becomes one \nclass worse. These conditions last until the \nmount lands and is allowed to rest for at \nleast one hour. \n* The rider can guide the mount with his \nknees and feet, keeping his hands free. A \nproficiency check is made only after the \ncharacter suffers damage. If the check is \nfailed, the character is knocked from the \nsaddle. A second check is allowed to see if \nthe character manages to catch himself (thus \nhanging from the side by one hand or in \nsome equally perilous position). If this fails, \nthe rider falls. Of course a rider can strap \nhimself into the saddle, although this could \nbe a disadvantage if his mount is slain and \nplummets toward the ground. \nRiding, Land-Based: Those skilled in land \nriding are proficient in the art of riding and \nhandling horses or other types of ground \nmounts. When the proficiency slot is filled, \nthe character must declare which type of \nmount he is proficient in. Possibilities \ninclude griffons, unicorns, dire wolves, and \nvirtually any creatures used as mounts by \nhumans, demihumans, or humanoids. \nA character with riding proficiency can \nperform all of the following feats. Some of \nthem are automatic, while others require a \nproficiency check for success. \nThe character can vault onto a saddle \nwhenever the horse or other mount is stand- \ning still, even when the character is wearing \narmor. This does not require a proficiency \ncheck. The character must make a check, \nhowever, if he wishes to get the mount mov- \ning during the same round in which he lands \nin its saddle. He must also make a proficien- \ncy check if he attempts to vault onto the sad- \ndle of a moving mount. Failure indicates \nthat the character falls to the ground- \npresumably quite embarrassed. \nThe character can urge the mount to \njump tall obstacles or leap across gaps. No \ncheck is required if the obstacle is less than \nthree feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet \nwide. If the character wants to roll a profi- \nciency check, the mount can be urged to \nleap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump \nacross gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success \nmeans that the mount has made the jump. \nFailure indicates that it balks, and the char- \nacter must make another proficiency check \nto see whether he retains his seat or falls to \nthe ground. \n* The character can spur his steed on to \ngreat speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the \nanimal's movement rate for up to four \nturns. This requires a proficiency check \n62"
