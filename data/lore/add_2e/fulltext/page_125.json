Megarran, immediately above \nn, and Drelb, following him, must roll \nimbing checks. Megarran passes her \neck. But Drelb fails and is snapped off the \nill. Now Megarran must make another \neck with a -10 penalty (for two falling \naracters), and Targash, who's bringing up \nrear, must also roll a check with a - 10 \nualty.

Failure for a roped charac- \nter means he spends a round regaining his \nbalance; an unroped character falls if he \nTools are an inte- \npart of any mountaineer's equipment \nall climbs can profit from the use of \ns. Mountaineering tools include rope, \ntons (spikes), and ice axes. However, it is \nstaken belief that the main function of \n01s is to aid in a climb. The main purpose \npitons, rope, and the like is to prevent a \ndisastrous fall. Climbers must rely on their \nown skills and abilities, not ropes and \nspikes, when making a climb. Accidents \nhappen when people forget this basic rule \nand trust their weight to their ropes and \nTherefore, aside from ropes, other tools \ndo not increase the chance of climbing suc- \ncess. However, in the case of a fall, climbing \ntools can reduce the distance fallen. When a \ncharacter falls, he can fall only as far as the \nrope allows, if being belayed, or as far as \ntwice the distance to the last piton set (if the \npiton holds-a piton pulls free 15% of the \ntime when a sudden stress occurs). The dis- \ntance fallen depends on how far apart the \npitons have been set. Falling characters fall \ntwice the distance to the last spike that \nFor example, Ruth is 15 feet above his last \nton. Suddenly he slips. He falls the 15 feet \nhis piton, plus another 15 feet past his \nton since therek 15 feet of rope between \nand the piton, for a total of 30 feet \nand 3d6 points of falling damage. \nRoping characters together increases indi- \nvidual safety, but it also increases the chance \nthat more than one person falls. When a \ncharacter falls, the character(s) on either \nside of the falling climber must roll Climb- \ning checks (a penalty of - 10 is applied for \neach falling character after the first one to \nfall). If all checks are successful, the fall is \nstopped and no one suffers any damage. If a \ncheck is failed, that character also falls and \nClimbing checks must be repeated as before. \nClimbing checks are made until either the \nfall is stopped (the climbers on either side of \nthe falling characterls] successfully roll \nClimbing checks or the last nonfalling \nclimber succeeds with his check), or all the \nroped-together characters fall. \nskilled mountaineer to set up the rappel and \nto hold the rope at the bottom.
