Confused creatures react as fol- \nlows (roll Idlo): \nDIO \nRoll Reaction \n1 Wander away (unless prevented) for \nduration of spell \n2-6 Stand confused one round \n(then roll again) \n7-9 Attack nearest creature for one round \n(then roll again) \n10 Act normally for one round \n(then roll again) \nThe spell lasts one round for each level of \nthe caster. Those who fail their saving \nthrows are checked by the DM for actions \neach round, for the duration of the spell, or \nuntil the \"wander away for the duration of \nthe spell\" result occurs. \nWandering creatures move as far from the \ncaster as possible in their most typical mode \nof movement (characters walk, fish swim, \nbats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. \nWandering creatures also have a 50% \nchance of using any special innate move- \nment abilities (plane shift, burrowing, \nflight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are \nchecked at the beginning of each round. \nAny confused creature that is attacked per- \nceives the attacker as an enemy and acts \naccording to its basic nature. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nset of three nut shells. \nNote: If there are many creatures \ninvolved, the DM may decide to assume \navep.age results. For example, if there are 16 \norcs affected and 25% could be expected to \nsuccessfully roll the saving throw, then four \nare assumed to have succeeded, one wan- \nders away, four attack the nearest creature, \nsix stand confused and the last acts normal- \nly but must check next round. Since the orcs \nare not near the party, the DM decides that \ntwo who are supposed to attack the nearest \ncreature attack each other, one attacks an \norc that saved, and one attacks a confused \norc, which strikes back. The next round, the \nbase is 11 orcs, since four originally saved \nand one wandered off. Another one wan- \nders off, five stands confused, four attack, \nand one acts normally. \nConjrem- \n(Conjt~ratio&ummoning) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Earth), Summoning \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nA caster who performs a conjure earth \nelemental spell summons an earth elemental \nto do his bidding. The elemental is 60% \nlikely to have 12 Hit Dice, 35% likely to \nhave 16 Hit Dice, and 5% likely have 21 to \nto 24 Hit Dice (20 + ld4). Furthermore, the \ncaster needs but to command it, and it does \nas desired, for the elemental regards the \ncaster as a friend to be obeyed. The elemen- \ntal remains until destroyed, dispelled, sent \naway by dismissal or a holy word spell (see \nthe conjure fire elemental spell), or the spell \nduration expires. \nRange: 40 yards \nControl Weather (Alteration) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4d12 hours \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 4d4 square miles \nSaving Throw: None \nThe control weuther spell enables a priest \nto change the weather in the local area. The \nspell affects the weather for 4d12 hours in an \narea of 4d4 square miles. It requires one turn \nto cast the spell, and an additional ld4 turns \nfor the effects of the spell to be felt. The cur- \nrent weather conditions are decided by the \nDM, depending on the climate and season. \nWeather conditions have three components: \nprecipitation, temperature, and wind. The \nspell can change these conditions according \nto the following chart: \nThe upper-case headings represent exist- \ning weather conditions. The lower-case \nheadings below each upper-case heading are \nthe new conditions to which the caster can \nchange the existing conditions. Further- \nmore, the caster can control the direction of \nthe wind. For example, a day that is clear, \nwarm, and with moderate wind can be con- \ntrolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con- \ntradictions are not possible-fog and strong \nwind, for example. Multiple control weath- \ner spells can be used only in succession. \nThe material components for this spell are \nthe priest's religious symbol, incense, and \nprayer beads or similar prayer object. Obvi- \nwhere there are appropriate dimatic condi- \ntions. \nIf Weather is a major sphere for the priest \n(as it is for druids), duration and area are \ndoubled, and the caster can change the pre- \nvailing weather by two places (e.g., he can \ncause precipitation to go from partly cloudy \nto heavy sleet, temperature to go from cool \nto arctic, and wind to go from calm to \nstrong). \nously, this spell functions only in areas \nCreeplng boom \n(Conjur&on/Sllmmoning) \nSphere: Animal, Summoning \n-0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the caster utters the spell of creep- \ning doom, he calls forth a mass of from 500 \nto 1,OOO ([ ld6 + 41 x 100) venomous, biting \nand stinging arachnids, insects, and myria- \npods. This urpet-like mam swarms in an \narea 20 feet square.
