    "text": "Beyond 15th level, a druid never gains \nany new spells (ignore the Priest Spell Pro- \ngression table from this point on). Casting \nlevel continues to rise with experience. \nRather than spells, spell-like powers are \nacquired. \n16th level: At 16th level, the hierophant \ndruid gains four powers: \n* Immunity to all natural poisons. Natu- \nral poisons are ingested or insinuated ani- \nmal or vegetable poisons, including monster \npoisons, but not mineral poisons or poison \ngas. \nVigorous health for a person of his age. \nThe hierophant is no longer subject to the \nability score adjustments for aging. \n* The ability to alter his appearance at \nwill. Appearance alteration is accomplished \nin one round. A height and weight increase \nor decrease of 50 percent is possible, with an \napparent age from childhood to extreme old \nage. Body and facial features can resemble \nany human or humanoid creature. This \nalteration is not magical, so it cannot be \ndetected by any means short of true seeing. \n17th Level: The character gains the bio- \nlogical ability to hibernate. His body func- \ntions slow to the point where the character \nmay appear dead to a casual observer; aging \nceases. The character is completely uncon- \nscious during hibernation. He awakens \neither at a preordained time (\"I will hiber- \nnate for 20 days\") or when there is a signifi- \ncant change in his environment (the weather \nturns cold, someone hits him with a stick, \netc.). \nA 17th-level hierophant druid can also \nenter the elemental plane of Earth at will. \nThe transference takes one round to com- \nplete. This ability also provides the means \nto survive on that plane, move around, and \nreturn to the Prime Material plane at will. It \ndoes not confer similar abilities or immuni- \nties on the Prime Material plane. \n18th level: The character gains the ability \nto enter and survive in the elemental plane \nof Fire. \n19th level: The character gains the ability \nto enter and survive in the elemental plane \nof Water. \n20th level: The character gains the ability \nto enter and survive in the elemental plane \nof Air. \nRogue \nRogues are people \nwho feel that the world (and everyone in it) \nsomehow owes them a living. They get by \nday by day, living in the highest style they \ncan afford and doing as little work as possi- \nble. The less they have to toil and struggle \nlike everyone else (while maintaining a com- \nfortable standard of living), the better off \nthey think they are. While this attitude is \nneither evil nor cruel, it does not foster a \ngood reputation. Many a rogue has a ques- \ntionable past or a shady background he'd \nprefer was left uninvestigated. \nRogues combine a few of the qualities of \nthe other character classes. They are \nallowed to use a wide variety of magical \nitems, weapons, and armor. \nRogues have some special abilities that \nare unique to their group. All rogues tend to \nbe adept at languages and thus have a per- \ncentage chance to read strange writings they \ncome across. All are skilled in climbing and \nclinging to small cracks and outcroppings- \neven more skilled than the hardy men of the \nmountains. They are aIert and attentive, \nhearing things that others would miss. \nFinally, they are dextrous (and just a little \nbit light-fingered), able to perform tricks \nand filch small items with varying degrees \nof success. \nRogues have a number of special abilities, \nsuch as picking pockets and detecting noise, \nfor which they are given a percentage \nchance of success (this chance depends on \nthe class, level, Dexterity score, and race of \nthe rogue). When a rogue tries to use a spe- \ncial ability, a percentile dice roll determines \nwhether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the \ndice roll is equal to or less than the special \nability score, the attempt succeeds. Other- \nwise, it fails. (See this page and page 39 for \nmore details.) \nAll rogues use Table 25 to determine their \nadvancement in levels as they gain experi- \nence points. \nAll rogues gain one six-sided Hit Die \n(ld6) per level from 1st through 10th. After \nloth level, rogues earn 2 hit points per level \nand no longer receive additional hit point \nbonuses for high Constitution scores. \nTable 25: ROGUE EXPERIENCE LEVELS \nLevel ThiefIBard Hit Dice (d6) \n1 0 1 \n2 1,250 2 \n8 70,000 8 \n9 11o.Ooo 9 \n14 880,OOO 10+8 \n.. \n19 1,980,000 10 + 18 \nThief \nAbility Requirement: Dexterity 9 \nPrime Requisite: Dexterity \nRaces Allowed: All \nThieves come in all sizes and shapes, \nready to live off the fat of the land by the \neasiest means possible. In some ways they \nare the epitome of roguishness. \nprofession of thief is not honorable, \nheroes have been more \nous-Reynard the Fox, \nand Ali Baba are but a \nthief is a romantic hero \nThe thief's prime requisite is Dexterity; a \ncharacter must have a minimum score of 9 \nto qualify for the class. While high numbers \nin other scores (particularly Intelligence) are \ndesirable, they are not necessary. The thief \ncan have any alignment except lawful good. \nMany are at least partially neutral. \nA thief with a Dexterity score of 16 or \nmore gains a 10 percent bonus to the experi- \nence points he earns. \nThieves have a limited selection of weap- \nons. Most of their time is spent practicing \nthieving skills. The allowed weapons are \nclub, dagger, dart, hand crossbow, knife, \nlasso, short bow, sling, broad sword, long \nsword, short sword, and staff. A thief can \nwear leather, studded leather, padded leath- \ner, or elven chain armor. When wearing aqy \nallowed armor other than leather, the thief's \nabilities are penalized (see Table 29). \nTo determine the initial value of each \nskill, start with the base scores listed on \nTable 26. To these base scores, add (or sub- \ntract) any appropriate modifiers for race, \nDexterity, and armor worn (given on Tables \n27, 28, and 29, respectively). \nThe scores arrived at in the preceding par- \nagraph do not reflect the effort a thief has \nspent honing his skills. To simulate this \nextra training, all thieves at 1st level receive \n60 discretionary percentage points that they \ncan add to their base scores. No more than \n30 points can be assigned to any single skill. \nOther than this restriction, the player can \ndistribute the points however he wants. \nEach time the thief rises a level in experi- \nence, the player receives another 30 points \nto distribute. No more than 15 points per \nlevel can be assigned to a single skill, and no \nskill can be raised above 95 percent, includ- \ning all adjustments for Dexterity, race, and \narmor. As an option, the DM can rule that \nsome portion of the points earned must be \napplied to skills used during the course of \nihe adventure. \n38 \nI."
