(See Tables 2 and 5. ) \nMagical items like cloaks and rings of \nprotection give bonuses to a character’s sav- \ning throw (these are listed in the item \ndescriptions in the DMG). \nMagical armor allows a saving throw \nbonus only when the save is made necessary \nby something physical, whether normal or \nmagical; magical armor never gives a saving \nthrow bonus against gas (which it cannot \nblock), poison (which operates internally), \nand spells that are mental in nature or that \ncause no physical damage. \nFor example, magical armor would not \nhelp a character’s saving throw against the \nsting of a giant scorpion, the choking effects \nof a stinking cloud spell, or the transforma- \ntion effect of a polymorph others spell. \nMagical armor does extend its protective \npower to saving throws against acid sprays \nor splashes, disintegration, magical and \nnormal fires, spells that cause damage, and \nfalls (if any saving throw is allowed in this \ncase). Other situations must be handled on a \ncase-by-case basis by the DM. \nSpecific spells and magical items have \neffects, both good and ill, on a character’s \nsaving throws. Often, spells force the victim \nto save with a penalty, which makes even \nthe most innocuous spell quite dangerous. \n(Specific information can be found in the \nspell descriptions, for spells, or in the \nDMGs Magical Items section, for magical \nitems.) \n&or poisons of verminous creatures \nsuch as giant centipedes, while dangerous, \nare weak and unlikely to bring about death \nin a healthy man. To recreate this effect in \nthe game, a saving throw bonus is allowed \nfor anyone affected by these poisons. The \nDM has this information. \nUnpredicteble situations are sure to crop \nup. When this happens, the DM must deter- \nmine whether saving throw modifiers are \nappropriate. As a guideline, modifiers for \nsituations should range from -4 to +4. An \nevil cleric attacked in his shrine could very \nwell have a +3 bonus to all his saving \nthrows and a - 3 penalty applied to those of \nhis enemies. The powerful evil of the place \ncould warrant the modifier. \nMagic Resistance \nSome creatures or \nitems strongly resist the effects of magic (or \nimpart such resistance to others). This \nmakes them more difficult to affect with \nmagical energy than ordinary creatures or \nitems. \nA rare few creatures are extremely anti- \nmagical-magic rolls off them like water off \na duck‘s back. More common are creatures, \nespecially from the outer planes of exist- \nence, that live in enchanted or sorcerous \nlands and are filled with powerful magical \nenergies. These creatures eat and breathe \nthe vapors of wizardry, and they have a \nhigh tolerance against arcane power. \nMagic resistance is an innate ability-that \nis, the possessor does not have to do any- \nthing special to use it. The creature need not \neven be aware of the threat for his magic \nresistance to operate. Such resistance is part \nof the creature or item and cannot be sepa- \nrated from it. (Creatures, however, can vol- \nuntarily lower their magic resistance at \nwill.) \nMagic resistance is also an individual \nability. A creature with magic resistance \ncannot impart this power to others by hold- \ning their hands or standing in their midst. \nOnly the rarest of creatures and magical \nitems have the ability to bestow magic \nresistance upon another. \nMagic resistance is given as a percentile \nnumber. For a magical effect to have any \nchance of success, the magic resistance must \nbe overcome. The target (the one with the \nmagic resistance) rolls percentile dice. If the \nroll is higher than the creature’s magic resist- \nance, the spell has a normal effect. If the roll \nis equal to or less than the creature’s magic \nresistance, the spell has absolutely no effect \non the creature. \nEffects of Magic Resistance \nMagic resistance en- \nables a creature to ignore the effects of spells \nand spell-like powers. It does not protect the \ncreature from magical weapon attacks or \nfrom natural forces that may be a direct or \naccidental result of a spell. Nor does it pre- \nvent the protected creature from using his \nown abilities or from casting spells and \nusing magical items. It can be effective \nagainst both individually targeted spells \nand, within limits, area-effect spells. \nIf a magic resistance roll fails, and the \nspell has normal effect, the target can make \nall saving throws normally allowed against \nthe spell. \nWhen Magic Resistance Applies \nMagic resistance ap- \nplies only if the successful casting of a spell \nwould directly affect the resistant creature \nor item. Thus, magic resistance is effective \nagainst magic missile (targeted at a creature \nor item) or fireball (damaging the area the \ncreature or item is in) spells. \nMagic resistance is not effective against \nan earthquake caused by a spell. While the \ncreature may suffer injury or death falling \ninto a chasm the spell opens under its feet, \nthe magical energy of the spell was directed \nat the ground, not the creature. Magic \nresistant creatures are not immune to events \nthat occur as the consequence of spells, only \ntothedirectenergycreatedorrekasedbya \nSpell. \nPlayer characters do not normally have \nmagic resistance (though they still get sav- \ning throws vs. magical spells and such); this \nability is reserved mainly for special mon- \nsters. \nSuccessful Magic Redstance Rolls \nA successful magic \nresistance check can have four different \nresults, depending on the nature of the spell \nbeing resisted: \nIndividugV Targeted Spells By defini- \ntion, these spells affect just one creature, \nand only the targeted creature rolls for mag- \nic resistance (if it has any). If a spell of this \ntype is directed at several targets, each rolls \nindependently of the others. (An example of \nthis would be a hold person spell aimed at \nfour creatures, with each creature getting a \nmagic resistance roll, if they have magic \nresistance.) \nIf the magic repistance roll is successful, \nthe spell has no effect on that creature. If the \nspell is targeted only at the creature, the \nspell fails completely and disappears. If sev- \neral targets are involved, the spell may still \naffect*others who fail their magic resistance \nroll. \nArea-Effect Spells: These spells are not \ntargeted on a single creature, but on a point. \nThe spell’s effect encompasses everything \nwithin a set distance of that point. A suc- \ncessful magic resistance check enables the \ncreature to ignore the effect of the spell. \nHowever, the spell is not negated and still \napplies to all others in the area of effect. \nIn-PIace Spelle: These spells operate con- \ntinuously in a particular place or on a par- \nticular creature, character, or item. Pro- \ntection from evil is one example of this kind \nof spell. \nMagic resistance comes into play only if a \ncreature or item finds himself (or itself) in \nthe place where the spell is in operation. \nEven then, magic resistance may not come \ninto play-nothing happens if the spell isn’t \nof a type that affects the character. Thus, a \npart water spell would not collapse simply \nbecause a magic resistant creature walked \nthrough the area. A protection from evil \nspell, which could affect the creature, would \nbe susceptible to magic resistance. \nIf the DM determines that a magic mist- \nance roll is appropriate, and the roll, suc- \nceeds, the in-place spell collapses (u+mlly \nwith a dramatic thunderclap and pqff of \nsmoke). \nPermanent SpeS: Magic resistanre is \ninsufficient to destroy a permanent spell. \nInstead, the spell is negated (within the wme \nguidelines given for in-place spells) for as \nlong as the magic resistant creature is ip the \narea of effect. \nThus, a magic-resistant creature mi&t be \ni \n1 \n102"
