    "text": "Vision and Light (Light) \nI \nthough on a clear day woods may hide a \nbear until he is 30 yards away, it is still a \nclear day for visibility. The bear, once seen, \ncan be quickly and easily identified as a \nbear. The DM has more information on spe- \ncific terrain effects on sighting. \nAs a final caveat, the ranges in Table 62 \nassume Earth-like conditions. Sighting con- \nditions on one of the Lower Planes, or the \nhorizon distance on another world, could be \nentirely different. If your DM feels he must \ntake this into account, he will have to learn \nmore about the subject at his local library or \nmake it up. \nLight \nMost characters can- \nnot see much without light. Some night con- \nditions (those for the ou~oors) are given in \nTable 62, But all of these mume some small \namount of light. In totally lightless condi- \ntions, normal vision is impossible, unless a \nsource of light is ded by the party. \nLight sources vary in the area they affect. \nTable 63 gives the radius of light and burn- \ning time for the most common types of light \nSOWCes. \nTable 63; LIGHT SOURCES \nsource \nBeacon lantern \nBonfire \nBullseye lantern \nCandle \nContinual light \nHooded lantern \nLi&t spell \nTorch \nWcppon' \ncampfire \nRadius \n240 ft.' \n50 ft. \n60 ft.\" \n35 fi. \n5 ft. \n60 ft. \n30 ft. \n20 ft. \n15 ft. \n5 ft. \nBurningtime \n30 rninutedpint \n=/a hour/armload \n2 howdpint \n1 hour/doad \n10 minutes/inch \nIndefinite \n2 hours/pint \nVariable \n30 minutes \nAs desired \nLight from these is not cast in a radius, \nbut a rather in a cone-shaped beam. At its \nfar end, the cone of light from a beacon lan- \ntern is 90 feet wide. A bdseye lantern has a \nbeam 20 feet wide at its far end. \n** Magical weapons shed light if your \nDM allows this optional rule. \nOf course, while a lantern or fire enables \ncharacters to see, it does have some disad- \nvantages. The greatest of these is that it is \nhard to sneak up on someone if he can see \nyou coming. It is hard to remain inconspicu- \naus when you have the only campfire on the \nplain, or you are canying the only torch in \nthe dungeon. Furthermore, not only do \ncreatures know you are coming, they can \ngenerally see you before you see them (since \nthe light source illuminates the area around \nyou, those outside this area can see into the \narea). Characters should always bear these \nrisks in mind. \ntnfravision \nSome characters \nand monsters have the power of infrmision. \nThis can mean one of two things, depending \non whether the standard or the optional rule \nis used (this is discussed in detail in the \nDungeon Master's Guide). The choice is left \nto the DM and he must tell the players how \nhe wants infravision to work. Regardless of \nhow the power functions, the range of infra- \nvision is at most 60 feet unless otherwise \nnoted. \nAt times it is use4u.l \nfor characters to look at objects or creatures \nvia reflections in a mirror. This is particular- \nly true of those creatures so hideous (such as \na medusa} that gazing directly upon them \nmight turn the viewer to stone. When using \na mirror, a light source must be present. Sec- \nond, attempting to direct your actions by \nlooking in a mirror is very disorienting (try \nit and see). Thus, all actions requiring an \nability or proficiency check or an attack roll \nsuffer a -2 penalty. The character also loses \nall Dexterity bonws to Armor Class if \nfighting an opponent seen only in a mirror. \n118"
