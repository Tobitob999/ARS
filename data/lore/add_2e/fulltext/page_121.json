    "text": "Time and Movement (Jogging and Running) \nCharacters can also move faster than the \nnormal walking pace. In the dungeon (or \nanytime the character is using his dungeon \nmovement rate) the character can automati- \ncally increase his movement to that of his \nnormal walking pace. In doing so, however, \nhe suffers a -1 penalty to his chance of \nbeing surprised and gives a +1 bonus to \nothers on their chance of being surprised by \nhim (the rapidly moving character is not \ntaking care to conceal the noise of his pas- \nsage in the echoing confines of the under- \nground). Furthermore the character does \nnot notice traps, secret doors, or other unu- \nsual features. \nIt is also certainly possible for a character \nto jog or run-an especially useful thing \nwhen being chased by creatures tougher \nthan he cares to meet. The simplest method \nfor handling these cases is to roll an initia- \ntive die. If the fleeing character wins, he \nincreases the distance between himself and \nhis pursuers by 10 times the difference in the \ntwo dice (in feet or yards, whichever the \nDM feels is most appropriate). This is \nrepeated each turn until the character \nescapes or is captured. (If this seems unreal- \nistic, remember that fear and adrenaline can \ndo amazing things!) \nJogging and Runnir \n(Optional Rule) \nwants greater precision in a chase, th \nspeeds of those-involved in the chase \nbe calculated exactlv. (But this is ti \nconsuming and can slow down an excit. \ning chase.) Using this optional rule, \ncharacter can always double his norm \nlmovement rate (in yards) to a jog. Thus \ncharacter with a movement rate of 12 \nican jog 240 yards in a round. While 1 \nging, a character can automatically k \ngoing for the number of rounds equa \nhis Constitution. After this limit \nbeen reached, the player must roll a \ncessful Constitution check at the en \neach additional round spent jogging. \nThere are no modifiers to this check. \nbnce a Constitution check is failed, the \ncharacter must stop and rest for as man \nrounds as he spent jogging. After this, \nan resume his jogging pace with no p \nlties (although the same limitations \nuration apply). \nIf a jogging pace isn’t fast enough, a \nzharacter can also run. If he rolls a suc- \nzessful Strength check, he can move at \nthree times his normal rate; if he rolls a \nStrength check with a -4 penalty, he can \nquadruple his normal rate; if he rolls a \nStrength check with a - 8 penalty, he can \nquintuple his normal rate. Failing a \nlgth check means only that the char- \nJ \nof running, hecannot try to reach th \nlevel again in the same run. \nContinued running requires \ntution check every round, with \nthat depend on how long and \nthe character has been running. \na - 1 penalty for each round of \nat triple speed, a -2 penalty \nround of running at quadruple sp \nand a - 3 penalty for each round of run \nning at quintuple speed (these penaltie \nare cumulative).

Hc \ndecides to speed up. The player rolls L \nStrength check, rolling a 7. Ragnar pour! \non the speed, increasing up to 360 ya \nper round (triple speed). Some of \nguardsmen drop out of the race, b \nfew hold in there. Ragnar now has a \npenalty to his Constitution check.

Next round another \n-heck is necessary, with a \nThe player rolls an 18. \nRamar collames in a shadowy alley, tak \n1- :r* \nCroskcountry Movement ’+$ \nA normal day’s \nmarch= lasts for ten hours, including rea- \nsonable stops for rest and meals. Under nor- \nmal conditions, a character can walk twice \nhis movement rate in miles in those ten \nhours. Thus an unencumbered man can \n120 \nwalk 24 miles across clear terrain. \nCharacters can also force march, inten- \ntionally hurrying along, at the risk of \nexhaustion. Force marching enables a char- \nacter to travel 2 % times his movement rate \nin miles (thus a normal man could force \nmarch 30 miles in a day). At the end of each \nday of the march, the character or creature \nmust roll a Constitution check. Large par- \nties (such as army units) make the check at \nthe average Constitution of the group \n(weaker members are supported, encour- \naged, and goaded by their peers). Creatures \nmust roll a saving throw vs. death at the end \nof each day’s force marching (since they lack \n.Constitution scores). A -1 penalty is \napplied to the check for each consecutive \nday spent force mardung. If the check is \npassed, the force marching pace can be con- \ntinued the next day. If the check fails, no \nmore force marching attempts can be made \nuntil the characters have completely recov- \nered from the ordeal. Recovery requires 1/z \nday per day of force marching. \nEven if the Constitution check fails, the \ncharacter can continue overland movement \nat his normal rate. \nOne drawback of force mardung is that \neach day of force marching results in a -1 \npenalty to all attack rolls. This modifier is \ncumulative. Half a day’s rest is required to \nremove one day’s worth of force maTdljng \npenalty. Characters who have managed to \nforce march for eight straight days suffer a -8 \npenalty to their attack rolls; it takes four days \nof rest to return to no attack roll penalty. \nOverland movement rates can be \nincreased or decreased by many factors. \nTerrain can speed or slow movement. Well- \ntended roads allow faster marching, while \ntrackless mountains slow marches to a \nsnail’s pace. Lack of food, water, and sleep \nweaken characters. Poor weather slows \ntheir pace. All these factors are detailed in \nthe DMG. \nSwimming \nAll characters are \neither untrained swimmers or proficient \nswimmers. \nWhen the DM determines the swimming \nability of characters, the decision should be \nbased on his campaign. If the campaign is \ncentered around a large body of water, or if \na character grew up near the sea, chances \nare good that the character knows how to \nswim. However, being a sailor does not \nguarantee that a character can swim. Many \na medieval mariner or black-hearted pirate \nnever learned how to swim and so devel- \noped a morbid fear of the water! This is one \nof the things that made ”walking the plank \nsuch a fearful punishment. Furthermore, \nsome character races are normally suspi- \ncious of water and swimming. While these \nmay vary from campaign to campaign, \n*"
