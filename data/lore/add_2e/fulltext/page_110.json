    "text": "I /- \nTreasure (Dividing and Storing) I \nacter discovers his wand is drained only \nwhen it no longer functions or suddenly \ncrumbles into useless dust. \nMiscellaneous Magic: Miscellaneous \nmagical items are where the true variety of \nmagical treasures lies. Each item possesses \nsomeunique power. There are horseshoes to \nmake your horse go faster, brooms to ride, \nsacks that hold more than they should, \npaints that create real things, girdles that \ngrant great strength, caps to make your \ncharacter smarter, books that increase abili- \nty scores, and much, much more. Each item \nis different and not all can be identified in \nthe same way. The effects of some become \nobvious the instant the item is handled, \ndonned, or opened. Others require research \nand questioning to learn the command word \nneeded to activate them. All are quite valu- \nable and rare. \nArtifacts and Relics: Finally, there are \nartifacts and relics. Don't count on your PC \never finding one of these rarest of all magi- \ncal items. Even if your character does find \none, think carefully before you decide to let \nhim keep it permanently. Artifacts are the \nmost powerful magical items in the game. \nIndeed, many are powerful enough to alter \nthe course of history! They are all unique \nand have unique histories. You can never \nfind more than one Hand of Vecna in a \nworld. Because it is so unique, each artifact \nhas special and significant powers. Artifacts \nnever appear by accident; they are always \nplaced by the DM. \nFinding artifacts is always the result of a \nvery special adventure. Your DM has placed \nthat artifact for a reason. It is not likely that \nhe really intends for your characters to keep \nit. Instead, he has something arranged in \nwhich you need that artifact for a specific \npurpose. The problem with keeping arti- \nfacts is that they are too powerful. Not only \ndo they unbalance your character in the \nshort run, they also eventually corrupt and \ndestroy him. The magical power of artifacts \nis such that they destroy their owners soon- \ner or later. There is a price to be paid for \npower, and it is not a cheap one. \nDividing and \nStoring-Treasure \nOnce your group \ncompletes a successful adventure, it is \nalmost certain to have collected some trea- \nsure. Therefore, it helps to have some prear- \nranged agreement about how this treasure is \nto be divided among the different player \ncharacters and their henchmen. This is a \ntrue role-playing decision that must be \nreached among all the players at the table. \nThere are no rules about how your charac- \nters should divide treasures. \nHowever, there are some suggested meth- \nods and reasons to make or not make some \nagreements. If you bear these in mind, you \nwill have fewer arguments and bad feelings \nbetween the different players and their char- \nacters in your group. \nCash treasure is the easiest. The most \ndirect and simplest method is equal shares \nfor all player characters and full or half \nshares for all henchmen. A player may \nargue that his character's contribution was \ngreater than that of other characters, but \nthese things average out in the long run. \nBesides, that player has no real idea of the \ncontribution of others. A character who \nguarded the rear may have discouraged hid- \nden opponents from springing an ambush \non the group, something that only the DM \nknows. \nAdditional considerations include ex- \ntraordinary costs. Some adventuring \ngroups establish a special fund to pay the \ncosts (if there are any) of healing, resurrect- \ning, or restoring fellow player characters. \nAgain this works on the principle that all \nfaced the danger and therefore all should \nshare equally in the expenses. Other groups \nmake allowances for differing character \nlevels (higher level characters assumedly \nshouldered more of the burden of the \nadventure, and so should be rewarded pro- \nportionately.) Some parties give special \nrewards to those who took greater chances \nor saved others. These encourage everyone \nin the group to take part. \nMagical treasure is more difficult to \ndivide up, since there is rarely enough to \ngive a useful item to every character, nor are \nall items of equal value or power. Here you \nmust rely more on your sense of fairness if \nyou wish to maintain party harmony. Since \nmagical items are worthwhile to a party \nonly if they can be used, your first concern \nshould normally be to get the right item into \nthe right hands. A magical sword in the pos- \nsession of a wizard is not nearly as useful as \nit would be in the hands of a fighter. Like- \nwise, a wand does a fighter little good but \ncould be a potent addition to a wizard. \nTherefore it is a good idea to match items to \ncharacters. \nAlternatively, your party could deter- \nmine the price an item would sell for, and \nthen make it available to any PC who is \nwilling to give the rest of the party that \namount of money. If more than one player is \nwilling to pay the price, the interested play- \ners could roll dice to see who gets the item. \nOr, for items that several characters could \nall use equally well (such as a potion of heal- \ning that is useful to all), the characters can \nbargain with each other and roll dice for \nchoices. A player character may relinquish \na claim on one magical item in exchange for \nanother. A character who has already \nreceived a magical item may not be allowed \nanother choice if there are not enough pieces \nto go around. If no other agreement can be \nreached, the players can roll dice and have \n1 09 \ntheir characters pick in descending order. It \nis a fair method (since people cannot right- \nfully complain about a random roll), but it \ncan create imbalances. One or two charac- \nters could wind up with the bulk of the mag- \nical items over the course of several \nadventures. At this point, they would be \nwise to voluntarily withdraw from the selec- \ntion process. \nThere are tactical issues to think about \nwhen distributing treasure. It is simply not \nwise for one or two characters to carry the \nbulk of the party's magical items. Successful \nadventurers spread their gear throughout \ntheir party. (This holds true even for explor- \ners and special forces in the real world.) This \nway, if one character falls off the cliff and \ndisappears forever or is spirited away by an \ninvisible stalker, the party has not lost ev- \nerything. To illustrate another consider- \nation, you are better off to have the fighters, \nthieves, and mages carry the healing potions \nrather than let the cleric do it, since he has \nhealing spells. If he has both the healing \nspells and the potions and should disappear \ninto the mist, your party has lost all its heal- \ning ability. If it is spread around through the \ngroup, at worst you might lose the potions \nor the spells, but not both (unless disaster \nreally strikes, in which case there is no way \nto prevent it anyway). In the end, you will \nfind that it does not pay to be too greedy. \nOnce your characters have assembled a \nsizeable amount of treasure, they have to \nfind some place to keep it. If your DM is \nrunning a fairly medieval campaign, one \nthing PCs are not going to find is a bank like \ntoday's. Instead, your characters must find \nother ways to keep their money secure. \nChests with strong locks are a good start, \nbut there are still better methods. One \nchoice is to make the treasure small enough \nthat you can carry it with you at all times. \n(Of course, one good mugging and you're \nbroke.) There is also the difficulty of buying \na drink with a 1,ooO-gp gem. A second \nchoice is to place your money in the hands \nof someone you think you can trust. We all \nknow what the risks are there. You could \nhave your character give his fortune to a \nlocal lord or church and then hope to call in \nfavors at a future date. This is not quite as \nfoolish as it sounds. If the beneficiary of \nyour largess refuses to honor your agree- \nment, you'll never give him money again \nand neither will anyone else, most likely. If \nno one gives him any money, where will he \nfind the funds to support his life-style? No, \nsuch a person must seriously try to honor \nhis commitments. Of course, he may not do \nas much as you would like. The best solu- \ntion is that used throughout history-buy \ngoods and chattels. Land, livestock, and \ntrade goods are harder to steal and harder to \nlose. If you must keep a large fortw, it is \nbest to keep it in something that can be car- \nried easily and is unlikely to be stolen."
