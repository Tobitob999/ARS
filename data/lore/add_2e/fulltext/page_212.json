Multi- \nple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; \nalthough if a cabinet had three drawers, \neach could be separately warded. \nWhen the spell is cast, the priest weaves a \ntracery of faintly glowing lines around the \nwarding sigil. For every five square feet of \narea to be protected, one round is required \nto trace the warding lines of the glyph. The \ncaster can affect an area equal to a square \nthe sides of which are the same as his level, \nin feet. The glyph can be placed to conform \nto any shape up to the limitations of the \ncaster‘s total square footage. Thus a 6th- \nlevel caster could place a glyph on a 6’ x 6’ \nsquare, shape it into a rectangle 4‘ x 9‘, a \nband 2‘ by 18‘, or a sipgle strip 1’ by 36’. \nWhen the spell is completed, the glyph and \ntracery become invisible. \nThe priest traces the glyph with incense, \nwhich, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, \nmust be sprinkled with powdered diamond \n(at least 2,OOO gp worth). \nTypical glyphs shock for ld4 points of \nelectrical damage per level of the spellcaster, \nexplode for a like amount of fire damage, \nparalyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The \nDM may allow any harmful priest spell \neffect to be used as a glyph, provided the \ncaster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. \nSuccessful saving throws either reduce \neffects by one-half or negate them, accord- \ning to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot \nbe affected or bypassed by such means as \nphysical or magical probing, though they \ncan be dispelled by magic and foiled by \nhigh-level thieves using their find-and- \nremove-traps skill. \nThe DM may decide that the exact glyphs \navailable to a priest depend on his religion, \nand he might make new glyphs available \naccording to the magical research rules. \nHold Animal (EnchantmenffCharm) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/levei \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 animals in a \nSaving Throw: Neg. \n4(rfOOt Cube \nBy means of this spell, the caster holds \none to four animals rigid. Animals affected \nare normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, \nor reptiles, but not monsters such as cen- \ntaurs, gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. Apes, \nbears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant \nbeavers, and similar animals are subject to \nthis spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per \ncaster level. The caster decides how many \nanimals can be affected, but the greater the \nnumber, the better chance each has to suc- \ncessfully save against the spell. Each animal \ngets a saving throw: if only one is the subject \nPriest Spells (3rd level) \nof the spell, it has a penalty of - 4 to its roll; \nif two are subject, each receives a penalty of \n-2 to its roll; if three are subject, each \nreceives a penalty of -1 to its roll; if four \nare subject, each gets an unmodified saving \nthrow. \nA maximum body weight of 400 pounds \n(100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal \nper caster level can be affected-e.g., an \n8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200- \npound mammals or a like number of 800- \npound nonmammals, such as birds or \nreptiles. \nLocate Object (Divination) \nReversible \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yd./level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 8 hours \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell helps locate a known or famil- \niar object. The priest casts the spell, slowly \nturns, and will sense when he is facing in the \ndirection of the object to be located, provid- \ned the object is within range-e.g., 90 yards \nfor 3rd-level priests, 100 yards for 4th, 110 \nyards for 5th. etc. The spell locates such \nobjects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, tools, \nweapons, or even a ladder or stairway. \nOnce the caster has fixed in his mind the \nitem sought, the spell locates only that item. \nAttempting to find a specific item, such as a \nkingdom’s crown, requires an accurate men- \ntal image. If the image is not close enough to \nthe actual item, the spell does not work; in \nshort, desired but unique objects cannot be \nlocated by this spell unless they are known \nby the caster. The spell isblocked by lead. \nThe casting requires the use of a piece of \nlodestone. \nThe reversal, obscure object, hides an \nobject from location by spell, crystal ball, \nor similar means for eight hours. The caster \nmust touch the object being concealed. \nNeither application of the spell affects liv- \ning creatures. \nMagical Vestment (Enchantment) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enchants the caster’s vestment, \nproviding protection at least the equivalent \nof chain mail (AC 5). The vestment gains a \n+1 enchantment for each three levels of the \npriest beyond 5th level, to a maximum of \nAC 1 at 17th level. The magic lasts for five \nrounds per level of the caster, or until the \ncaster loses consciousness. If the vestment is \nworn with other armors, only the best AC \n(either the armor or the vestment) is ud- \nthis protection is not cumulative with any \nother AC protection. \nment to be enchanted and the pri \nsymbol, which are not expended. \nMeld Into Stone (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Earth) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 8 rounds + Id8 rounds \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the priest to \nbody and possessions into a single \nstone. The stone must be lar \naccommodate his body in all t \nsions. When casting is complete, the priest \nand not more than 100 pounds of nonliving \ngear merge with the stone. If either con&- \ntion is violated, the spell fails and is wasted. \nWhile in the stone, the priest remains in \ncontact, however tenuous, with the face of \nthe stone through which he melded. The \npriest remains aware of the passage of time. \nNothing that goes on outside the stone can \nbe seen or heard, however. Minor physical \ndamage to the stone does not harm the \npriest, but its partial destruction, if enough \nso that the caster no longer fits, expels the \npriest with 4d8 points of damage. The \nstone’s destruction expels the priest and \nslays him instantly, unless a successful saw- \ning throw vs. spell is rolled. \nThe magic lasts for ld8+8 rounds, the \nvariable part of the duration rolled secredy \nby the DM. At any time before the duration \nexpires, the priest can step out of thetatme \nthrough the stone surface he entered. If the \nduration runs out, or the effect is dispelled \nbefore the priest exits the stone, then he is \nviolently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of \ndamage. \nThe following spells harm the priest if \ncast upon the stone that he is occupying: \nThe material components are t"
