Once the item is enchanted, \nthe wizard must give it willingly to an indi- \nvidual, at the same time informing him of a \ncommand word to be spoken when the item \nis to be used. To make use of the item, the \nrecipient must speak the command word at \nthe same time that he rends or breaks the \nitem. When this is done, the individual and \nall that he is wearing and carrying are \ninstantly transported to the abode of the \nwizard. No other creatures can be affected. \nThe reversed application of the spell \ntransports the wizard to the immediate \nvicinity of the possessor of the spelled item, \nwhen it is broken and the command word \nsaid. The wizard will have a general idea of \nthe location and situation of the item pos- \nsessor, but has no choice whether or not to \ngo (making this a rare casting indeed! ) . \n?he material components used include \ngemstones totaling not less than 5,000 gp \nvalue; whether it is a faceted gem or not is \nimmaterial. The components can be \nenchanted only once per month (usually on \na night of a clear, full moon). At that \ntime,the object is set for the type of succor \nand its final destination (either the location \nof the spellcasting or an area well known to \nthe wizard). \nTemporal Stasis (Alteration) \nRwemible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: One creature \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting this spell, the wizard places \nthe recipient creature into a state of sus- \npended animation. This cessation of time \nmeans that the creature does not grow older. \nIts body functions virtually cease. This state \npersists until the magic is removed by a dis- \npel magic spell or the reverse of the spell \nltemporul reinstatement) is uttered. Note \nthat the reverse requires only a single worc \nand no somatic or material components. \nThe material component of a temporu \nstasis spell is a powder composed of dia. \nmond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust, \neach crushed stone of at least 100 gp value \nTime Stop (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting a time stop spell, the wizard \ncauses the flow of time to stop for one round \nin the area of effect. Outside this area the \nsphere simply seems to shimmer for an \ninstant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free \nto act for ld3 rounds of apparent time. The \nwizard can move and act freely within the \narea where time is stopped, but all other \ncreatures, except for those of demigod and \ngreater status or unique creatures, are fro- \nzen in their actions, for they are literally \nbetween ticks of the time clock. (The spell \nduration is subjective to the caster.) Notlung \ncan enter the area of effect without being \nstopped in time also. If the wizard leaves the \narea, the spell is immediately negated. \nWhen the spell duration ceases, the wizard \nis again operating in normal time. \nNote: It is recommended that the DM use \na stop watch or silently count to time this \nspell. If the caster is unable to complete the \nintended action before the spell duration \nexpires, he will probably be caught in an \nembarrassing situation. The use of a tele- \nuort spell before the expiration of the time \nitop spell is permissible. \nWeird WusionlPhantasrn) \nRange: 30 yards \nZomponents: V, S \nhration: Concentration \nZasting Time: 9 \nkea of Effect: 2Gfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell confronts those affected by it \nvith phantasmal images of their most feared \naemies, forcing an imaginary combat that \nems real, but actually occurs in the blink \npf an eye. When this spell is cast, the wizard \nnust be able to converse with the victim to \niring the spell into being. During the cast- \nng, the wizard must call out to the creatures \nD be affected, informing one or all that their \ninal fate, indeed their doom, is now upon \nhem. \nThe force of the magic is such that even if \nle creatures make their saving throws vs. \nwll, fear will paralyze them for a full \nround, and they will lose ld4 Strength \npoints from this fear (the lost Strength will \nreturn in one turn). Failure to save vs. spell \ncauses the creature or creatures to face their \nnemeses, the opponents most feared and \ninimical to them. Actual combat must then \ntake place, for no magical means of escape is \npossible. The foe fought is real for all intents \nand purposes. Affected creatures that lose, \ndie. If a creature’s phantasmal nemesis from \nthe weird spell is slain, then the creature \nemerges with no damage, no loss of items \nseemingly used in the combat, and no loss of \nspells likewise seemingly expended. Ejcperi- \nence for defeating the weird is gained if \napplicable. Although each round of combat \nseems normal, it takes but 1/10 of a round. \nDuring the course of the spell, the caster \nmust concentrate fully upon maintaining it. \nIf the combat goes beyond ten rounds, thaw \nwho saved against the spell can take action. \nIf the caster is disturbed, the weird spdl \nends immediately. Creatures attacked while \nparalyzed with fear are free of the paralysis \nimmediately. \nWish (ConjurationSummonjng) \nRange: Unlimited \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe wish speN is a more potent version a \na limited wish. If it is used to alter nrlity \nwith respect to damage sustained by a party, \nto bring a dead creature to lik, or to escape \nfrom a difficult situation by lifting the spell- \ncaster (and his party) from one place to \nanother, it will not cause the wizard any die \nability. Other forms of wishes, however, \ncause the spellcaskr to weaken (-3 on \nStrength) and require a days of bed rest \ndue to the stresse6 the wish places upan \ntime, space, and his body. Regarb of \nwhat is wished for, the exact terminology of \nthe wish spell is likely to be carried out. \nCasting a wish spell ages the caster five \nyears. \nThis discretionary power of the DM js \nnecessary in order to maintain &arm bd- \nmce. As wishing another c~hllc dead \nwould be grossly unfair, for example, yoon \nDM might well advance the spelkpsta to a \n:uture period in which the creature is no \nonger alive, effectively putting the wishing \n:haracter out of the campainn. \n/"
