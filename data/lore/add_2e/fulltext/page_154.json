    "text": "Wizard Spells (3rd Level) -- \nIf the sepia snake misses its target, it dissi- \npates in a flash of brown light, with a loud \nnoise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that \nis 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one \nround. \nThe spell cannot be detected by normal \nobservation, and detect magic reveals only \nthat the entire text is magical. A dispel mag- \nic can remove it; an erase spell destroys the \nentire page of text. It can be cast in combina- \ntion with other spells that hide or garble \ntext. \nThe components for the spell are 100 gp \nworth of powdered amber, a scale from any \n' cube, 1 creature/level \naving Throw: Neg. \nA slow spell causes affected creatures to \nve and attack at 1/z of their normal rates. \ntes a haste spell or equivalent, but \nnot otherwise affect magically speeded \nslowed creatures. Slowed creatures have \ncenter of the spell outward. Saving \nws against the spell suffer a -4 penalty. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nSpectral Force (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 60 yards + 1 yard/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 40' cube + a 10' cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe spectral force spell creates an illusion \nin which sound, smell, and thermal illusions \nare included. It is otherwise similar to the \nimproved phantusrnal force spell. The spell \nlast for three rounds after concentration \nceases. \nkrggcstioa (Enrhanme!nKh) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast by the wizard, he \ninfluences the actions of the chosen recipient \nby the utterance of a few words-phrases or \na sentence or two-suggesting a course of \naction desirable to the spellcaster. The crea- \nture to be influenced must, of course, be \nable to understand the wizards sug- \ngestion-it must be spoken in a language \nthat the spell recipient understands. \nThe suggestion must be worded in such a \nmanner as to make the action sound reason- \nable; asking the creature to stab itself, \nthrow itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or \ndo some other obviously harmful act auto- \nmatically negates the effect of the spell. \nHowever, a suggestion that a pool of acid \nwas actually pure water and that a quick dip \nwould be refreshing is another matter. Urg- \ning a red dragon to stop attacking the wiz- \nards party so that the dragon and party \ncould jointly loot a rich treasure elsewhere \nis likewise a reasonable use of the spelI's \npower. \nThe course of action of a suggestion can \ncontinue in effect for a considerable dura- \ntion, such as in the case of the red dragon \nmentioned above. Conditions that will trig- \nger a special action can also be specified; if \nthe condition is not met before the spell \nexpires, then the action will not be per- \nformed. If the target successfully rolls its \nsaving throw, the spell has no effect. Note \nthat a very reasonable suggestion causes the \nsaving throw to be made with a penalty \n(such as -1, -2, etc.) at the discretion of \nthe Dungeon Master. Undead are not sub- \nject to suggestion. \nThe material components of this spell are \na snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- \ncomb or a drop of sweet oil. \nTongues (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to speak and \nunderstand additional languages, whether \nthey are racial tongues or regional dialects. \nThis does not enable the caster to speak with \nanimals. The spell enables the caster to be \nunderstood by all creatures of that type \nwithin hearing distance, usually 60 feet. \nThis spell does not predispose the subject \ntoward the caster in any way. \nThe wizard can speak one additional \ntongue for every three levels of experience. \nThe reverse of the spell cancels the effect of \nthe tongues spell or confuses verbal com- \nmunication of any sort within the area of \neffect. \nThe material component is a small day \nmodel of a ziggurat, which shatters when \nthe spell is pronounced. \nVampiric Touch (Necromancy) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: One touch \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the caster touches an opponent in \nmelee with a successful attack roll, the \nopponent loses Id6 hit points for every two \ncaster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for \na 12th-level caster. The spell is expended \nwhen a successful touch is made or one turn \npasses. The hit points are added to the cast- \ner's total, with any hit points over the cast- \ner's normal total treated as temporary \nadditional hit points. Any damage to the \ncaster is subtracted from the temporary hit \npoints first. After one hour, any extra hit \npoints above the caster's normal total are \nlost. The creature originally losing hit \npoints through this spell can regain them by \nmagical or normal healing. Undead mea- \ntures are unaffected by this spell. \nl \nWater Breathing (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level + ld4 hours \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe recipient of a water breathing spell is \nable to breathe water freely for the duration \nof the spell. The caster can touch more than \none creature with a single casting; in this \ncase the duration is divided by the number \nof creatures touched. The reverse, air \nbreathing, enables water-breathing ma- \ntures to comfortably survive in the atmos- \nphere for an equal duration. \nThe material commnent of the spell is a \nshort reed or piece 01 straw."
