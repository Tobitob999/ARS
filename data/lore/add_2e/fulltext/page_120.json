    "text": "I \nAs in the real world, time passes in all \nAD&W game worlds. Weeks slip away as \nwizards research spells. Days go by as char- \nacters ride across country. Hours pass while \nexploring ruins. Minutes flash by during \nbattles. All of these are passages of time. \nThere are two different types of time that \nare talked about in rhm rules. Game time is \nthe imaginary time that passes for the char- \nacters in the game. Real time is the time in \nthe real world, the time that passes for the \nplayers and DM as they play the AD&D \ngame. The two times are very different; \nplayers and DMs should be careful to distin- \nguish game time from real time. \nFor example, when the character \nDelsenora researches a spell for three weeks, \nthis is three weeks of game time. Delsenora \nis out of action as three weeks passes in the \ncampaign world. Since nothing interesting \nat all happens to Delsenora during this \nresearch time, it should require only a min- \nute or two of real time to handle the situa- \ntion. The exchange in real time is something \nlike this: \nLouise (Delsenora's player): \"Delsenora's \ngoing to research her new spell.\" \nDM: \"Okay, it'll take three weeks. Nothing \nhappens to her. While she's doing that, \nthe rest of you get a chance to heal your \nwounds and do some stuff that you've \nbeen ignoring. Johann [pointing at \nanother player], you'd better spendsome \ntime at the church. The patriarch's been a \nlittle upset that you haven't been attend- \ning ceremonies.\" \nlon (Johann's player): \"Can't I go out and \nem some more experience?\" \nDM (Not wanting to deal with a split-up \ngroup): \"The patriarch mumbles some- \nthing about failing in your duties to your \ndeity, and he rubs his holy symbol a lot. \nYou know, it's not very often that low \nlevels like you have personal audiences \nwith the patriarch. What do you think?\" \nJon: \"Marvelous. Subtle hint. I'll stay and \nbe a good boy.\" \nDM: \"Well, great! The three weeks pass. \nNothing happens. Del, make your roll \nfor the spell research.\" \nAnd so three weeks of game time flash by \nin brief minutes of real time. \nThe importance of game time is that as a \ncampaign progresses, characters tend to \nbecome involved in different time- \nconsuming projects. Three characters may \nset off on a four-week overland journey, \nwhile a mage researches for six weeks. At \nthe inn, a fighter rests and heals his wounds \nfor two weeks. It is important to note how \nmuch time passes on different tasks, so the \nactivities of different characters can be fol- \nlowed. \nCampaign time is measured just as it is in \nChapter 14: Time and Movement \nreal life: years, months, weeks, days, hours, \nminutes, and seconds. But, since this is a \nfantasy game, the DM can create entirely \ndifferent calendars for his world. There may \nbe only ten months in the year or 63 days to \na month. When begnning play, these things \nare not tremendously important, so players \nneed not worry about them right away. \nWith-continued adventuring, players even- \ntually become familiar with the calendar of \nthe campaign. \nRounds and turn are units of time that \nare often used in the ADkD game, particu- \nlarly for spells and combat. A round is \napproximately equal to a minute (it is not \nexactly one minute, so as to grant the DM \nsome flexibility during combat). A turn is \nequal to ten minutes of game time. Tvns are \nnormally used to measure specific tasks \n(such as searching) and certain spells. Thus \na spell that lasts ten huns is equal to 100 \nminutes or 1% hours. \nMovement \nClosely related to \ntime is movement. Clearly your character is \nable to move, otherwise adventures would \nbe rather static and boring. But how fast can \nhe move? If a large, green camon crawler is \nscuttling after Rath, is the redoubtable \ndwarf fast enough to escape? Could Rath \noutrun an irritated but heavily loaded elf? \nSooner or later these considerations become \nimportant to player characters. \nAll characters have movement rates that \nare based on their race. Tab€e 64 lists the \nmovement rates for unencumbered charac- \n-- \nters of different races. \nTable 64: BASE MOVEMENT RATES \nRace Rate \nHuman 12 \nDwarf 6 \nElf 12 \nHalf-elf 12 \nGnome 6 \nHalfling 6 \nA character can narmally walk -.is moue- \nment rate in tens of yards m a single rod. \nAn unencumbered human can walk I20 \nyards (360 feet), slightly more than a foot- \nball field, in one minute. A dwarf, SimiIarly \nequipped, can walk 60 yards in the same \ntime. This walk is at a fairly brisk, though \nnot strenuous, pace that can be kept up for \nlong periods of time. \nHowever, a character may have to move \nslower than this pace. If the chcter & car- \nrying equipment, he may move slower \nbecause of the encumbrance (see page 76), if \nthis optional rule is used. As the character \ncarries more gear, he gradually slows doon\\ \nuntil he reaches the point where he can bue \nly move at all. \nWhen a character is moving through a \ndungeon or similar setting, his movement \nrate corresponds to tens of feet per rd \n(rather than the tens of yards per lound of \noutside movement). It is assumcd that tfre \ncharacter is moving more cautioudy, pay- \ning attention to what he sees and hears while \navoiding traps and pitfalls. Again, this rate \ncan be lowered if the optional encumbt.pmee \nsystem is used. \nc \n119"
