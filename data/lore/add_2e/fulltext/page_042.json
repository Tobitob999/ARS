At 10th level, a thief gains a \nlimited ability to use magical and clerical \nscrolls. A thief's understanding of magical \nwritings is far from complete, however. The \nthief has a 25 percent chance to read the \nscroll incorrectly and reverse the spell's \neffect. This sort of malfunction is almost \nalways detrimental to the thief and his par- \nty. It could be as simple as accidentally cast- \ning the reverse of the given spell or as \ncomplex as a foul-up on a fireball scroll, \ncausing the ball of flame to be centered on \nthe thief instead of its intended target. The \nexact effect is up to the DM (this is the sort \nof thing DMs enjoy, 80 expect the unexpect- \ned). \nThieves do not build castles or fortresses \nin the usual sense. Instead, they favor small, \nfortified dwellings, especially if the true pur- \npose of the building can easily be disguised. \nA thief might, for example, construct a well- \nprotected den in a large city behind the \nfacade of a seedy tavern or old warehouse. \nNaturally, the true nature of the place will \nbe a closely guarded secret! Thieves almost \nalways build their strongholds in or near cit- \nies, since that is where they ply their trades \nmost lucratively. \nThis, of course, assumes that the thief is \ninterested in operating a band of thieves out \nof his stronghold. Not all thieves have larce- \nny in their hearts, however. If a character \ndevoted his life to those aspects of thieving \nthat focus on scouting, stealth, and the intri- \ncacies of locks and traps, he could build an \nentirely different sort of stronghold-one \nfilled with the unusual and intriguing \nobjects he has colkcted during his adventur- \nous life. Like any thief's home, it should \nblend in with its surroundings; after all, a \nscout never advertises his whereabouts. It \nmight be a formidable maze of rooms, secret \npassages, sliding pads, and mysterious \nparaphernalia from across the world. \nOnce a thief reaches loth level, his repu- \ntation is such that he can attract followem- \neither a gang of scoundrels and scal?wags or \na group of scouts eager to learn from a \nreputed master. The thief attracts 4d6 of \nthese fellows. They are generally loyal to \nhim, but a wise thief is always suspicious of \nhis comrades. Bble 31 can be used to deter- \nmine the type and level of followers, or the \nDM can choose followers appropriate to his \ncmpaign. \nTable 31: THIFE'S FOWWERS \nDlW Level \nRoll Follower Ronsc \n0143 Dwarf fighterkhief 1-4 \n04-08 Dwarfthief 1-6 \n09-13 Elfthief 1-6 \n14-15 Elf thief/fiiter/mage 1-3 \n16-18 Elfthief/mage 1-4 \n19-24 Gnomethief 1-6 \n25-27 Gnome thief/fighter 1-4 \n28-30 Gnome thief/illusionist 1-4 \n31-35 Half-dfthief 1-6 \n36-38 Half-elf thief/fighter 1-4 \n39-41 Half-elfthief/fighber/mage 1-3 \n42-46 Halflinsthief 1-8 \n47-50 Halflins thief/fighter 1-6 \n51-98 Humanthief 1-8 \n99 Human dual-class thief/? 14/14 \n00 Other (DM selection) - \nThieves tend to be very jealous of their \nterritory.
