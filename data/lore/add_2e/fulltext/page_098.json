Second, \ncharging characters gain no Dexterity bo- \nnuses to Armor Class and they suffer an AC \npenalty of 1. Finally, if the defend@r is using \na spear or polearm weapon and sets it \nagainst the charge (bracing the butt against \na stone or his foot), he inflicts double dam- \nage on a successful hit. \nTo get out of a com- \nbat, characters can make a careful with- \ndrawal or they can simply flee. \nWithdrawing: When making a with- \ndrawal, a character carefully backs away \nfrom his opponent (who can chow to fol- \nlow). The character moves up to 1/3 his nor- \nmal movement rate. \nIf two characters are fighting a single op- \nponent and one of them decides to with- \ndraw, the remaining character can block the \nadvance of the opponent. This is a useful \nmethod for getting a seriously injured man \nout of a combat. \nFleeing: To flee from combat, a character \nsimply turns and runs up to his full move- \nment rate. However, the fleeing character \ndrops his defemes and turns his back to his \nopponent. \nThe e~lgmy is allowed a free attack (or \nmultiple attacks if the creature has several \nattacks per round) at the rear of the fleeing \ncharacter. This attack is made the instant \nthe character flees: It doesn't count against \nthe number of attacks that opponent is al- \nlowed during the round, and initiative is ir- \nrelevant. \nThe fleeing character can be pursued, un- \nless a companion blocks the advance of the \nenemy. \nAttncklng Without Killing \nThere are times \nwhen a character wants to defeat another \nbeing without killing it. A companion may \nhave been charmed into attacking his \nfriends (and his friends don't want to kill \nhim to save themselves!); an enemy may \nhave information the PCs can get only by \nsubduing him; characters may simply see \nthe monetary value of bringing back a real, \nlive monster. Whatever the case, sooner or \nlater characters are going to try. \nThere are three types of nonlethal \nattacks-punching, wrestling, and over- \nbearing. Punching is basic bare-fistd fight- \ning. Wrestling is the classic combinaZlon of \ngrappling, holds, and throws. Overbearing \nis simply trying to pull down an opponent \nby sheer mass or weight of numbers, pin- \nning him to the ground. \nCombat (Attacking Without Killing) \nPunching and Wrestling \nThese are the most \nbasic of combat skills, unknowingly prac- \nticed by almost all children as they mu& \nand tumble with each other. Thus all char- \nacters, regardlessof class, are assumed to be \nsomewhat proficient in both these forms of \nfighting. \nPunching occurs when a character attacks \nwith his fists. No weapons are used, al- \nthough the character can wear an iron \ngauntlet or similar item. Wrestling requires \nboth hands free, unencumbered by shields \nand the like. \nWhen punchmg or wrestling, a normal at- \ntack roll is made. The normal Armor Class \nof the target is used. If a character is at- \ntempting to wrestle in armor, the modifiers \non Table 57 are used (these are penalties to \nthe attacker's attack roll). Normal modifiers \nto the attack roll are also applied. \nPenalties for being held or attacking a \nheld opponent do not apply to wrest@ \nWrestling involvea a lot of ho \ntwisting as it is, and the damalp du&n \nsystem for punching and wrestling takesthis \ninto account. \nTabIe 57t @MOR MODIFIERS \nFOR WRESTLING \nARaor h&odikr \n-1 \n-2 \n-5 \n-8 \n- 10 \nStudded leather \nChain. ring, and scale mail \nBanded, splint, and plate mail \nField plate armar \nFull plate armor \nIf the attack roll is successful, consult Ta- \nble 58 to find the dt of the attack: Cross- \nindex the character's modified attack roll \nwith the proper attack form.

Punching \nand wrestling attacks can succeed on attack \nrolls of 1 or less (exceptions to the general \nrule). \nTaFle 58: PUNCHING AND WRESTLING RESULTS \nAttack Roll Punch D%mage %KO wsertle \n20+ Haymaker 2 10 Bear hug\" \n19 Wild swing 0 1 Ann twist \n13 Hook 2 9 Leg lock \n7 Combination 2 10 Throw \n1 Wild swing 0 2 Leg mist \nLess than 1 Haymaker 2 25 Bearhug* \n* Hold can be maintained from round to round, until broken."
