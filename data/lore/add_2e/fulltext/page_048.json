    "text": "given, they break their word only if they \ncan find a way to do it legally, within the \nlaws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant \nand a devious, greedy merchant are exam- \nples of lawful evil beings. \nNeutral Good: These characters believe \nthat a balance of forces is important, but \nthat the concerns of law and chaos do not \nmoderate the need for good. Since the uni- \n.. verse is vast and contains many creatures \nstriving for different goals, a determined \npursuit of good will not upset the balance; it \nmay even maintain it. If fostering good \nmeans supporting organized society, then \nthat is what must be done. If good can only \ncome about through the overthrow of exist- \ning social order, so be it. Social structure it- \nself has no innate value to them. A baron \nwho violates the orders of his king to de- \nstroy something he sees as evil is an example \nof a neutral good character. \nTrue Neutral: True neutral characters be- \nlieve in the ultimate balance of forces, and \nthey refuse to see actions as either good or \nevil. Since the majority of people in the \nworld make judgments, true neutral charac- \nters are extremely rare. True neutrals do \ntheir best to avoid siding with the forces of \neither good or evil, law or chaos. It is their \nduty to see that all of these forces remain in \nbalanced contention. \nTrue neutral characters sometimes find \nthemselves forced into rather peculiar alli- \nances. To a great extent, they are compelled \nto side with the underdog in any given situa- \ntion, sometimes even changing sides as the \nprevious loser becomes the winner. A true \nneutral druid might join the local barony to \nput down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop \nout or switch sides when the gnolls were \nbrought to the brink of destruction. He \nwould seek to prevent either side from be- \ncoming too powerful. Clearly, there are \nvery few true neutral characters in the \nworld. \nNeutral Evil: Neutral evil characters are \nprimarily concerned with themselves and \ntheir own advancement. They have no par- \nticular objection to working with others or, \nfor that matter, going it on their own. Their \nonly interest is in getting ahead. If there is a \nquick and easy way to gain a profit, \nwhether it be legal, questionable, or obvi- \nously illegal, they take advantage of it. Al- \nthough neutral evil characters do not have \nthe every-man-for-himself attitude of cha- \notic characters, they have no qualms about \nbetraying their friends and companions for \npersonal gain. They typically base their alle- \ngiance on power and money, which makes \nthem quite receptive to bribes. An unscm- \npulous mercenary, a common thief, and a \ndouble-crossing informer who betrays peo- \nple to the authorities to protect and advance \nhimself are typical examples of neutral evil \ncharacters. \nChaotic Good: Chaotic good characters \nare strong individualists marked by a streak \nof kindness and benevolence. They believe \nin all the virtues of goodness and right, but \nthey have little use for laws and regulations. \nThey have no use for people who \"try to \npush folk around and tell them what to do.\" \nTheir actions are guided by their own moral \ncompass which, although good, may not al- \nways be in perfect agreement with the rest of \nsociety. A brave frontiersman forever mov- \ning on as settlers follow in his wake is an ex- \nample of a chaotic good character. \nChaotic Neutral: Chaotic neutral charac- \nters believe that there is no order to any- \nthing, including their own actions. With this \nas a guiding principle, they tend to follow \nwhatever whim strikes them at the moment. \nGood and evil are irrelevant when making a \ndecision. Chaotic neutral characters are ex- \ntremely difficult to deal with. Such charac- \nters have been known to cheerfully and for \nno apparent purpose gamble away every- \nthing they have on the roll of a single die. \nThey are almost totally unreliable. In fact, \nthe only reliable thing about them is that \nthey cannot be relied upon! This alignment \nis perhaps the most difficult to play. Luna- \ntics and madmen tend toward chaotic neu- \ntral behavior. \nChaotic Evil: These characters are the \nbane of all that is good and organized. Cha- \notic evil characters are motivated by the de- \nsire for personal gain and pleasure. They see \nabsolutely nothing wrong with taking what- \never they want by whatever means possible. \nLaws and governments are the tools of \nweaklings unable to fend for themselves. \nThe strong have the right to take what they \nwant, and the weak are there to be ex- \nploited. When chaotic evil characters band \ntogether, they are not motivated by a desire \nto cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful \nenemies. Such a group can be held together \nonly by a strong leader capable of bullying \nhis underlings into obedience. Since leader- \nship is based on raw power, a leader is likely \nto be replaced at the first sign of weakness \nby anyone who can take his position away \nfrom him by any method. Bloodthirsty buc- \ncaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are \nfine examples of chaotic evil personalities. \nNon-Aligned Creatures \nIn addition to the \nalignments above, some things-par- \nticularly unintelligent monsters (killer \nplants, etc.) and animals-never bother \nwith moral and ethical concerns. For these \ncreatures, alignment is simply not applica- \nble. A dog, even a well-trained one, is nei- \nther good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. It is \nsimply a dog. For these creatures, alignment \nis always detected as neutral. \nPlaying the \nCharacter's Alignment \nAside from a few \nminimal restrictions required for some char- \nacter classes, a player is free to choose what- \never alignment he wants for his character. \nHowever, before rushing off and selecting \nan alignment, there are a few things to con- \nsider. \nFirst, alignment is an aid to role-playing \nand should be used that way. Don't choose \nan alignment that will be hard to role play \nor that won't be fun. A player who chooses \nan unappealing alignment probably win \nwind up playing a different alignment any- \nway. In that case, he might as well have cho- \nsen the second alignment to begin with. A \nplayer who thinks that lawful good charac- \nters are boring goody-two-shoes who don't \nget to have any fun should play a chaotic \ngood character instead. On the other hand, \na player who thinks that properly role- \nplaying a heroic, lawful good fighter would \nbe an interesting challenge is encouraged to \ntry it. No one should be afraid to stretch his \nimagination. Remember, selecting an align- \nment is a way of saying, \"My character is \ngoing to act like a person who believes this.\" \nSecond, the game revolves around coop- \neration among everyone in the group. The \ncharacter who tries to go it alone or gets ev- \neryone angry at him is likely to have a short \ncareer. Always consider the alignments of \nother characters in the group. Certain com- \nbinations, particularly lawful good and any \nsort of evil, are explosive. Sooner or later \nthe group will find itself spending more time \narguing than adventuring. Some of this is \nunavoidable (and occasionally amusing), \nbut too much is ultimately destructive. As \nthe players argue, they get anm As they \nget angry, their characters begin fightins \namong themselves. As the characters fight, \nthe players continue to get more angry. \nOnce anger and hostility take over a game, \nno one has fun. And what's the point of \nplaying a game if the players don't have \nfun? \nThird, some people choose to play evil \nalignments. Although there is no specific \nprohibition against this, tke are several \nreasons why it is not a good idea. First, the \nAD&W game is a game of heroic fantasy. \nWhat is heroic about being a villain? If ah \nevilly aligned group plays its alignment cor- \nrectly, it is as much a battle for the charac- \nters to work together as it is to take on the \noutside world. Neutral evil individuals \nwould be paranoid (with some justification) \nthat the others would betray them for profit \nor self-aggrandizement. Chaotic evil char- \nacters would try to get someone else to take \nall the risks so that they could become (or \nremain) strong and take over. Although \nlawful evil characters might have some code"
