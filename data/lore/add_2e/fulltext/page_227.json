    "text": "Priest Spells (6th level) \nI \nSixth-Level Spells \nAda1 Servant \n(ConjurationlSummoning) \nSphere: Summoning \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell summons an invisible aerial ser- \nvant to find and bring back an object or \ncreature described to it by the priest. Unlike \nan elemental, an aerial servant cannot be \ncommanded to fight for the caster. When it \nis summoned, the priest must have cast a \nprotection from mi2 spell, be within a pro- \ntective circle, or have a special item used to \ncontrol the aerial servant. Otherwise, it \nattempts to slay its summoner and return \nfrom whce it came. \nThe object or creature to be brought must \nbe such as to allow the aerial servant to \nphysically bring it to the priest (an aerial \nservant can carry at least 1,OOO pounds). If \nprevented, for any reason, from completing \nthe assigned duty, the aerial servant \nbecomes insane and seeks out and attempts \nto destroy the caster. The aerial servant \nreturns to its own plane whenever the spell \nlapses, its duty is Mled, it is dispelled, the \npriest releases it, or the priest is slain. The \nspell lasts for a maximum of one dap for \neach level of experience of the priest who \ncast it. \nIf the creature to be fetched cannot detect \ninvisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, \nautomatically gaining surprise. If the crea- \nture involved can detect invisible objects, it \nstill suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls \nad by the aerial savant. Each round of \ncombat, the aerial servant must roll to \nattack. When a hit is scored, the aerial ser- \nvant h;rs grabbed the item or creature it was \nsent for. A creature with a Strength rating is \nallowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its \nbend bms chance, to escape the hold. If the \ncreature in question does not have a \nStrength rating, roll Id8 for each Hit Die the \naerial servant and the creature grabbed \nhave. The higher total is the stronger. Once \nseized, the creature cannot free itself by \nStrength or Dexterity and is flown to the \npriest forthwith. \nAnimal Summoning 111 \n(Conjuration, Summoning) \nSphere: Animal, Summoning \nRange: 100 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is the same in duration and \neffect as the 4th-level animal summoning I \nspell, except that up to four animals of no \nmore than 16 Hit Dice each can be summon- \ned, or eight of nomore than 8 Hit Dice, or \n16 creatures of no more than 4 Hit Dice. \nOnly animals within range of the caster at \nthe time the spell is cast will come. The cast- \ner can try three times to summon three dif- \nferent types of animals-e.g., suppose that \nwild dogs are first summoned to no avail, \nthen hawks are unsuccessfully called, and \nfinally the caster calls for wild horses that \nmay or may not be within summoning \nrange. Your DM will determine the chance \nof a summoned animal type being within \nrange of the spell. The animals summoned \nwill aid the caster by whatever means they \npossess, staying until a fight is over, a spe- \ncific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he \nsends them away, etc. Only normal or giant \nanimals can be summoned; fantastic ani- \nmals or monsters cannot be summoned by \nthis spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, \nmanticores, etc.). \nAnimate ObJect (Alteration) \nSphere: Creation, Summoning \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis powerful spell enables the priest \ncasting it to imbue inanimate objects with \nmobility and a semblance of life. The ani- \nmated object, or objects, then attacks \nwhomever or whatever the priest first desig- \nnates. The animated object can be of any \nnonmagical material whatsoever-wood, \nmetal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, \netc. Attempting to animate an object in \nsomeone's possession grants that person a \nsaving throw to prevent the spell's effect. \nThe speed of movement of the object \ndepends on its means of propulsion and its \nweight. A large wooden table would be \nrather heavy, but its legs would give it \nspeed. A rug could only slither along. A jar \nwould roll. Thus a large stone pedestal \nwould rock forward at 10 feet per round, a \nstone statue would move ht 40 feet per \nround, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, \nan ivory stool of light weight would move at \n226 \n120 feet per round. Slithering movement is \nabout 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is \n3q feet to 60 feet per round. The damage \ncaused by the attack of an animated object \ndepends on its form and composition. tight, \nsupple objects can only obscure vision, \nobstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, \netc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or oth- \nerwise strike for I& points of damage or \npossibly obstruct and trip, as do light, sup \nple objects. Hard, medium-wcfi5ht objects \ncan crush or strike for 2d4 points of dam- \nage, while larger and heavier * may \ninflict 3d4,4d4, or even 5d4 points of dam- \nage. \nThe frequency of attack of animated \nobjects depends on their method of locomo- \ntion, appendages, and method of attack. \nThis varies from as seldom as once every \nfive melee rounds to as frequently as once \nper round. The Armor Class of the object \nanimated is basically a function of ma& \nand movement ability. Damage depends on \nthe type of weapon and the object struck. A \nsharp cutting weapon is effective against \nfabric, leathe, wood, and like substansdg. \nHeavy smashing and crushing weapons are \nuseful against wood, stone, and metal \nobjects. Your DM will determine all of these \nfactors, as well as how much damage the \nanimated object can sustain before being \ndestroyed. The priest can animate one cubic \nfoot of material for each experience level he \nhas attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could \nanimate one or more objects whose solid \nvolume did not exd 14 cubic feet-a large \nstatue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen \naverage crocks. \nAnti-Animal Shell (Abjwatton) \nSpherp: Animal, Protection \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 tUnr/hel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 20' diameter hemisphere \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the caster brings into \nbeing a hexnispherid force field that pre \nvents the entrance of any sort of living crea- \nture that is wholly or partially animal (not \nmagical or extraplmar). Thus a sprite, a \ngiant, or a chimera would be kept out, but \nundead or conjured creatures could pass \nthrough the shell of force, as could such \nmonsters as aerial servants, imps, qwsits, \ngolems, elementals, etc. The anti-animal \nshell functions normally against cross- \nbreeds, such as cambions, and lasts for one \nturn for each level of experience the caster \nhas attained. Forcing the barrier against \ncreatures strains and ukimately collapses \nthe field. \nThe spell requires the caster's holy symbol \nand a handful of pepper."
