While wearing stud- \nded leather or lighter armor, the ranger can \ntry to move silently and hide in shadows. \nHis chance to succeed in natural surround- \nings is given on Table 18 (modified by the \nranger's race and Dexterity, as given on Ta- \nbles 27 and 28 on page 39). When attempt- \ning these actions in non-natural \nsurroundings (a musty crypt or city streets) \nthe chance of success is halved. Hiding in \nshadows and moving silently are not possi- \nble in any armor heavier than studded \nleather-the armor is inflexible and makes \ntoo much noise. \nIn their roles as protectors of good, rang- \ners tend to focus their efforts against some \nparticular creature, usually one that ma- \nrauds their homeland. Before advancing to \n2nd level, every ranger must select a species \nenemy. Typical enemies include giants, \norcs, lizard men, trolls, or ghouls; your DM \nhas final approval on the choice. Thereafter, \nwhenever the ranger encounters that enemy, \nhe gains a +4 bonus to his attack rolls. This \nenmity can be concealed only with great dif- \nficulty, so the ranger suffers a - 4 penalty on \nall encounter reactions with creatures of the \nhated type. Furthermore, the ranger will ac- \ntively seek out this enemy in combat in pref- \nerence to all other foes unless someone else \npresents a much greater danger. \nRangers are adept with both trained and \nuntamed creatures, having a limited degree \nof animal empathy. If a ranger carefully ap- \nproah or tends any natural animal, he \ncan try to modify the animal's reactions. (A \nnatural animal is one that can be found in \nthe real world-a bear, snake, zebra, etc.) \nWhen dealing with domestic or non- \nhostile animals, a ranger can approach the \nanimal and befriend it automatically. He \ncan easily discern the qualities of the crea- \nture (spotting the best horse in the corral or \nseeing that the runt of the litter actually has \ngreat promise). \nWhen dealing with a wild animal or an \nanimal trained to attack, the animal must \nroll a saving throw vs. rods to resist the \nranger's overtures. (This table is used even \nthough the ranger's power is non-magical.) \nThe ranger imposes a -1 penalty on the die \nroll for every three experience levels he has \nearned (-1 at 1st to 3rd, -2 at 4th to 6th, \netc.). If the creature fails the saving throw, \nits reaction can be shifted one category as \nthe ranger chooses. Of course, the ranger \nmust be at the front of the party and must \napproach the creature fearlessly. \nFor example, Beornhelm, a 7th-level \nranger, is leading his friends through the \nwoods. On entering a clearing, he spots a \nhw black bear blocking the path on the \nother side. Signaling his friends to wait, \nBeornhelm approacheq the beast, whisper- \ning soothing words. The DM rolls a saving \nthrow vs. rods for the bear, modified by -3 \nfor Beornhelm's level. The bear's normal re- \naction is unfriendly, but Beornhelm's pres- \nence reduces this to neutral. The party waits \npatiently until the bear wanders off to seek \nits dinner elsewhere. \nLater, Beomhelm goes to the horse market \nto get a new mount. The dealer shows him a \nspirited horse, notorious for being vicious and \nstubborn. Beomhelm approaches it caddy, \nagain speakmg soothingly, and mounts the \nstallion with no difficulty. Ridden by \nBeornhelm, the horse is spirited but well- \nbehaved. Approached by anyone else, the \nhorse reverts to its old ways. \nA rarrger can learn priest spells, but only \nthose of the plant or animal spheres (see \npage 34). when he reaches 8th level (see Ta- \nble 18). He gains and uses his spells accord- \ning to the rules given for priests (see page \n32). He does not gain bonus spells for a high \nWisdom score, nor is he ever able to use \nclerical scrolls or magical items unless spe- \ncifically noted otherwise. \nRangers can build castles, forts, or \nstrongholds, but do not gain any special fol- \nlowers by doing so. \nAt 10th level, a ranger attracts 2d6 fol- \nlowers. These followers might be normal \nhumans, but they are often animals or even \nstranger denizens of the land. Table 19 can \nbe used to determine these, or your DM \nmay assign specific followers. \nTable 19 RANGER'S FOLLOWERS \nDie \nRoll Follower \n01-10 Bear, black \n11-20 Bear, brown \n21 Brownie \n22-26 Cleric (human) \n39-40 Druid \n41-50 Falcon \n51-53 Fighter (elf) \n54-55 Fighter (gnome) \n56-57 Fighter (halfling) \n58-65 Fighter (human) \n67-72 Great cat (tiger, lion, etc.) * \n27-38 Dog/wolf \n66 Fighter/mage (elf)* \n73 Hippogriff \n74 Pegasus * \n75 Pixie * \n76-80 Ranger (half-elf) \n81-90 Ranger (human) \n91-94 Raven \n95 Satyr * \n96 Thief (halfling) \n97 Thief (human) \n98 Treant * \n99 Werebear/weretiger * \n00 Other wilderness creature \n(chosen by the DM) \n* If the ranger already has a follower of \nhis type, ignore this result and roll again. \nOf course, your DM can assign particuf9r' \ncreatures, either choosing from the list \nabove or from any other source. He can also \nrule that certain creatures are not found in \nthe region-it is highly unlikely that a tiger \nwould come wandering through a territory \nsimilar to western Europe! \nThese followers arrive over the course of \nseveral months. Often they are encountered \nduring the ranger's adventures (allowing \nyou and your DM a chance to role-play the \ninitial meeting). While the followers are au- \ntomatically loyal and friendb toward the \nranger, their future behavior tkpends on the \nranger's treatment of them. In all cases, the \nranger does not gain any special method of \ncommunicating with his followers. He must \neither have some way of speaking to them \nor they simply mutely accompany him on \nhis journeys. (\"Yeah, this bear's been with \nme for years. Don't know why-he just \nseems to follow me around. I don't own him \nand can't tell him to do anything he don't \nwant to do,\"said the grizzled old &man \nsitting outside the tavern.) \nOf course, the ranger is not ubligated to \ntake on followers. If he prefers to remain in- \ndependent, he can release his followers at \nany time. They reluctantly depart, but \nstand ready to answer any call for aid he \nmlght put out at a later time. \nLike the paladin, the ranger has a code of \nbehavior. \nA ranger must always retain his good \nalignment. If the ranger intentionally corn \nmits an evil act, he automatically losar his \nranger status. Thereafter he is consMcrrd a \nfighter of the same level (if he has more ex- \nperience points than a fighter of his level, he \nloses all the excess experience points). Hi9 \nranger status can nnwr be regained. If the \nranger involuntarily commits an evil act \n(perhaps in a situation of no choice), he cart- \nnot earn any more experience points until he \nhas cleansed himself of that evil. This can be \naccomplished by correcting the wrongs hc \ncommitted, revenging himself on the person \nwho forced him to commit the act, or releas- \ning those oppressed by evil. The ranger in- \nitinctively knows what things he must do to \nregain his status (i.e., the DM creates a spe- \n:ial adventure for the character). \nFurthermore, rangers tend to be loners, \nnen constantly on the move. They cannot \nlave henchmen, hirelings, mercenaries, or \nwen servants until they reach 8th level. \nNhile they can have any monetary amount \n>f treasure, they cannot have more treasm \nhan they can carry. Excess treasure must ei- \nher be converted to a portable form or de \ntated to a worthy institution (an NPC \n:rouu. not a player character). \nI \n29 \nI \nI"
