    "text": "to his spell book, you have to check to see if \nyour character learns that spell. The chance \nof learning a spell depends on your wizard's \nIntelligence, as given in Table 4. This chance \nmay be raised or lowered if your character is \na spedalist . \nllluolons \nOf all spells, those \nof the illusion school cause the most prob- \nlems. Not that they are more difficult for \nyour player character to cast, but these \nspells are more difficult for you to role-play \nand for your DM to adjudicate. Illusions \nrely on the idea of believability, which in \nturn relies on the situation and the state of \nmind of the victim. Your DM must deter- \nmine this for NPCs, which is perhaps an eas- \nier job. You must role-play this for your \ncharacter. \nSpells of this school fall into two basic \ngroups. Illusions are creations that manipu- \nlate light, color, shadow, sound, and some- \ntimes even scent. Higher level illusions tap \nenergy from other planes, and are actually \nquasi-real, being woven of extradimen- \nsional energies by the caster. Common illu- \nsions create appearances; they cannot make \na creature or object look like nothing (i.e., \ninvisible), but they can conceal objects by \nmaking them look like something else. \nPhantasms exist only in the minds of their \nvictims; these spells are never even quasi- \nreal. (The exceptions to this are the phuntas- \nmal force spells, which are actually illusions \nrather than phantasms.) Phantasms act \nupon the mind of the victim to create an \nintense reaction-fear being most common. \nThe key to successful illusions or phan- \ntasms is believability, which depends on \nthree main factors: what the caster' \nattempts, what the victim expects, and what \nis happening at the moment the spell is cast. \nBy combining the information from these \nthree areas, the player and the DM should \nbe able to create and adjudicate reasonable \nillusions and phantasms. \nWhen casting an illusion or phantasm, \nthe caster can attempt to do anything he \ndesires within the physical limits of the \nspell. Prior knowledge of the illusion cre- \nated is not necessary but is extremely useful. \nFor ample, suppose Dehorn dedes to \ncast a phantasmal force speU and can choose \nbetween creating the image of a troll (a crea- \nture she has seen and battled) OT that of a \nbeholder (a creature she has never seen but \nhas heard tem*~ng descriptions ofl. She can \neither use her memory to create a realistic \ntroll or use her imagination to create some- \nthing that may or may not look file a real \nbeholder. The troll, basad on her first-hand \nknowledge of these creatures. is going to \nhave lots of little details--a big nose, watts, \ngreen, scabby skin, and even a shambling \ntroll-like walk. Her illusion of a beholder will \nbe much less precise, just a floating ball with \none big eye and eyestalks. She doesn't know \nits color, sue, or behavior. \nThe type of image chosen by the caster \naffects the reaction of the victim. If the vic- \ntim in the above case has seen both a troll \nand a beholder, which will be more believ- \nable? Almost certainly it will be the troll, \nwhich looks and acts the way the victim \nthinks a troll should. He might not even rec- \nognize the other creature as a beholder since \nit doesn't look like any beholder he's ever \nseen. Even if the victim has never seen a troll \nor a beholder, the troll will still be more \nbelievable; it acts in a realistic manner, \n82 \nI \nwhile the beholder dues not. Thus spelkast- \ners are well-advised to create images of \nthings they have seen, for the same reason \nauthors are advised to write about things \nthey know. \nThe next important consideration is to \nask if the spell creates something that the \nvictim expects. Which of these two ill- \nwould be more believable-a huge dragon \nrising up behind a rank of attacking kobolds \n(puny little creatures) or a few ogres fonn- \ning a line behind the kobokk? Most ah- \nturers would find it hard to believe that a \ndragon would be working with kobolds. \nThe dragon is far too powerful to assodate \nwith such little shrimps. Ogres, however, \ncould very well work with kobolds- \nnon fodder. The key to a good illusion is to \ncreate something the victim does not expect \nbut can quickly accept. \nThe most believable illusion may be that \nof a solid wall in a dungeon, transforming a \npassage into a dead end. Unless the victim is \nfamiliar with these hallways, he has no rea- \nson not to believe that the wall is there. \nOf course, in a fantasy world many more \nthings can be believed than in the real \nworld. Flames do not spring out of nowhere \nin the red world, but this can happen in a \nfantasy world. The presence of magic in a \nfantasy world makes victims more willing \nto accept things our logic tells us cannot \nhappen. A creature appearing out of \nnowhere could be an illusion or it could be \nbossing them around and using them as can- \nsummoned. At the same time, you must \nremember that a properly role-played char- \nacter is familiar with the laws of his world. \nIf a wall of flames appears out of nowhere, \nhe will look for the spellcaster. A wall \nblocking a corridor may cause him to check \nfor secret doors. If the illusion doesn't con- \nform to his idea of how things work, the \ncharacter should become suspicious. This is \nsomething you have to provide for your \ncharacter and something you must renaem- \nber when your charaaer attempts to use \nillusions. \nThis then leads to the third factor in the \nbelievability of an illusion, how appropriate \nthe illusion is for the situation. As men- \ntioned before, the victim is going to have \ncertain kxpectations about any given \nencounter. The best illusions reinforce these \nexpectations to your character's advantage. \nImagine that your group runs into a war \nparty of ora in the local forest. What could \nyou do that would reinforce what the om \nmight already believe? They see your \ngroup, armed and ready for batde. They do \nnot know if you are alone or are the advance \nguard for a bisger troop. A good illusion \ncould be the glint of metal and spear points \ncoming up behind your party. Subtlety has \nits uses. The orcs will likely interpret your \nillusion as reinforcements to your group, \nenough to discourage them from attacking."
