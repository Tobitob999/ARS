    "text": "look like a wide and smooth road. The hal- \nlucinatory terrain persists until a dispel \nmagic spell is cast upon the area or until the \nduration expires. Individual creatures may \nsee through the illusion, but the illusion per- \nsists, affecting others who observe the \nscene. \nIf the illusion involves only a subtle \nchange, such as causing an open wood to \nappear thick and dark, or increasing the \nslope of a hill, the effect may be unnoticed \neven by those in the midst of it. If the change \nis extreme, a grassy plain covering a seeth- \ning field of volcanic mudpots, for instance, \nthe illusion will no doubt be noticed the \ninstant one person falls prey to it. Each level \nof experience expands the dimensions of the \narea affected, e.g., a '12th-level caster affects \na 120 yd. x 120 yd. x 120 yd. area. \nThe material components of this spell are \na stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant- \nleaf or grass blade. \nIce Storm (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can have one of two effects, at \nthe caster's option: Either great hail stones \npound down for one round in a 40-foot- \ndiameter area and inflict 3d10 points of \ndamage to any creatures within the area of \neffect, or driving sleet falls in an 80-foot- \ndiameter area for one round per caster level. \nThe sleet blinds creatures within its area for \nthe duration of the spell and causes the \n. ground in the area to be icy, thus slowing \n: movement by 50% and making it 50% \nprobable that a creature trying to move in \nthe area slip and falls. The sleet also extin- \nguishes torches and small fires. \nNote that this spell will negate a heat \nmetal spell. \nThe material components for this spell are \na pinch of dust and a few drops of water. \nliiudonary Waii (IIlusionPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1' x 10' x 10' \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates the illusion of a wall, \nfloor, ceiling, or similar surface, which is \npermanent until dispelled. It appears abso- \nlutely real when viewed, even magically, as \nwith the clerical spell, true seeing, or its \nequivalent, but physical objects can pass \nthrough it without difficulty. When the spell \nis used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, \nnormal demihuman and magical detection \nabilities work normally, and touch or prob- \ning searches reveal the true nature of the \nsurface, though they do not cause the illu- \nsion to disappear. \nThe material component is a rare dust \nthat costs at least 400 gp and requires four \ndays to prepare. \nImproved Invisibility \n(IUusionPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is similar to the invisibility \nspell, but the recipient is able to attack, \neither by missile discharge, melee combat, \nor spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, \nhowever, that there are sometimes telltale \ntraces, a shimmering, so that an observant \nopponent can attack the invisible spell \nrecipient. These traces are only noticeable \nwhen specifically looked for (after the invis- \nible character has made his presence \nknown). Attacks against the invisible char- \nacter suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, \nand the invisible character's saving throws \nare made with a +4 bonus. High Hit Dice \ncreatures that might notice invisible oppo- \nnents will notice a creature under this spell \nas if they had 2 fewer Hit Dice (they roll sav- \ning throws vs. spell; success indicates they \nspot the character). \nLeomund's Secure Shelter \n(Alteration, Enchantment) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 + 1 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 turns \nArea of Effect: 30 sq. ft./level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to magically \ncall into being a sturdy cottage or lodge, \nmade of material that is common in the area \nwhere the spell is cast-stone, timber, or (at \nworst) sod. The floor area of the lodging is \n30 square feet per level of the spellcaster, \nand the surface is level, clean, and dry. In all \nrespects the lodging resembles a normal cot- \ntage, with a sturdy door, two or more shut- \ntered windows, and a small fireplace. \nWhile the lodging is secure against winds \nof up to 70 miles per hour, it has no heating \nor cooling source (other than natural insula- \ntion qualities). Therefore it must be heated \nas a normal dwelling, and extreme heat \nadversely affects it and its occupants. The \ndwelling does, however, provide considera- \nble security otherwise, as it is as strong as a \n159 \nnormal stone building, regardless of its \nmaterial composition, resists flames and fire \nas if it were stone, and is impervious to nor- \nmal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege \nmachinery or giants). \nThe door, shutters, and even chimney are \nsecure against intrusion, the former two \nbeing wizard locked and the latter being \nsecured by a top grate of iron and a narrow \nflue. In addition, these three areas are pro- \ntected by an alarm spell. Lastly, an unseen \nservant is caIled up to provide service to the \nspellcaster. \nThe inside of the shelter contains rude \nfurnishings as desired by the spellcaster-up \nto eight bunks, a trestle table and benches, \nas many as four chairs or eight stools, and a \nwriting desk. \nThe material components of this spell are \na square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few \ngrains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and \nseveral splinters of wood. These must be \naugmented by the components of the ah \nand unseen seruant spells if these benefits \nare to be included (string and silver wire and \na small bell). \nMagic Mirror (Enchmhnent, Divination) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 hour \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard changes \na normal mirror into a scrying device simi- \nlar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of \nsuch a scrying device are found in the DMG \nunder the description for the crystal ball. \nThe mirror used must be of finely \nwrought and highly polished silver of a min- \nimum cost not less than 1,OOO gp. This mir- \nror is not harmed by casting the spell, but \nthe other material components-the eye of a \nhawk, an eagle, ,or even a roc, and nitric \nacid, copper, and zinc-are used up. \nThe following spells can be cast through a \nmagic mirror: comprihzd languuges, miad \nmagic, tongues, and infrrmision. The fol- \nlowing spells have a 5 % chance per level of \nthe caster of operating correctly: detect \nmagic, detect good or evil, and message. \nThe base chances for the subject to detect \nany crystal ball-like spell is listed in the qs- \ntal ball entry in the DMG (see the \"Miscella- \nneous Magic\" section)."
