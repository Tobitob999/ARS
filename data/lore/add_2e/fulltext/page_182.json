The image must be \nwithin view of the wizard projecting it at all \ntimes, and if his sight is obstructed, the spell \nis broken. Note that if the wizard is invisible \nat the time the spell is cast, the image is also \ninvisible until the casteis invisibility ends, \nthou& the ww must still be able to see \ntk (by means of a detect invisibility \naremethod) to maintain the spell. \n3\"\" rltt nipad uses dimension door, teleport, \ng&rd#f, or similar spell that breaks his \nb --& d.dbn, the project image spell ends. \n%euracSrl component of this spell is a \n&@ (doll) 6f the wizard. - \n2. \nReincarnqtion (Necromancy) \nRairge:ibuih \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Tie: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Pc!rson touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the wizard can bring back \nto life a person who died no more than one \nday per level of experience of the wizard \nbefore the casting of the spell. The essence \nof the dead person is transferred to another \nbody, possibly one very different from his \nformer body. Reincarnation does not \nrequire any saving throw, system shock, or \nresurrection survival roll. The corpse is \ntouched, and a new incarnation of the per- \nson will appear in the area in Id6 turns. The \nperson reincarnated recalls the majority of \nhis former life and form, but the character \nclass, if any, of the new incarnation might \nbe different indeed. The new incarnation is \ndetermined on the following table. If a play- \ner character race is indicated, the character \nmust be created. \n24-28 Gnome \n55-59 Hobgoblin \n60-73 Human \nNote: Very good or very evil persons will \nnot be reincarnated as creatures whose gem \neral alignment is the opposite. \nThe material components of the spell are \na small drum and a drop of blood. \nRepulsion (Abjuration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/2 levels \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Creatures in a \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto cause all creatures in the path of the area \nof effect to move directly away from his per- \nson. Repulsion occurs at the speed of the \ncreature attempting to move toward the \nspellcaster. The repelled creature continues \nto move away for a complete round even if \nthis takes it beyond spell range. The caster \ncan designate a new direction each round, \nbut use of this power counts as the caster's \nprincipal action in the round. The caster \ncan, of course, choose to do something else \ninstead of using the repulsion attack. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npair of small magnetized iron bars attached \nto two small canine statuettes, one ivory \nand one eboqy. \nlefoot-wide path \nShades (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDukation: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is related to the shadow mon- \nsters and demi-shadow monsters spells. The \nshades spell uses material from the plane of \nShadow to form semi-real illusions of one or \nmore monsters, up to 1 Hit Die per caster \nlevel. All shades created by one spell must \nbe of the same sort, and they have 60% of \nthe hit point total the real creatures would \nhave. Those viewing the shades and failing \ntheir saving throws vs. spell believe the illu- \nsion. \nThe shades perform as the real monsters \nwith respect to Armor Class and attack \nforms. Special attack forms such as petrifi- \ncation or level drain do not actually occur, \nbut a subject who believes the shgdes are \nreal will react appropriately, until the illu- \nsion is countered by a dispel magic spell or \nihe condition is countd by a heal spell. \nnose who roll successful saving throws see \n.he shades as transparent images superim- \n)osed on vague shadowy forms. These are \nhor Class 6 and cause only 60% of the \nrue monsters' normal melee damage. \nStone to Flesh (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe stone to flesh spell turns any sort of \nstone into flesh. If the recipient stone object \nwas formerly living, this spell, restores life \n(and goods), although the survival of the \ncreature is subject to the usual system shock \nsurvival roll. Any formerly living creature, \nregardless of size, can be thus returned to \nflesh. ordinary stone can be turned to flesh \nin a volume of nine cubic feet per leva of \nexperience of the spellcaster. Such flesh is \ninert, lacking a vital life force, unless a life \nforce or magical energy is available (for \nexample, this speli would turn a stone golem \ninto a flesh golem, but an ordinary siatue \nwould become a body). If cast upon stone, \nthe wizard can create a cylinder of fleshy \nmaterial from one to three feet in &meter \nand up to 10 feet long, allowing a pq to \nbe made. \nThe material components are a pinch of \nearth and a drop of blood. \nThe reverse, flesh to srm, turns flesh of \nany sort to stone. All possessions on theper- \nson of the creature likewise turn to stoae. \nThe intended subject of the spell dves a \npaving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If \na statue created by this spell is subjected to \nbreakage or weathering, the being (if ever \nreturned to his original, fleshy state) win \nhave similar damage, deformities, etc. The \nDM may allow such damage to be repaked \nby various high-level clerical spells, such as \nregenerate. \nThe ma'terial components of the spell are \nlime, water, and earth. \n(Alterafion, jn) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 roundllevel \nCasting Tie: 6 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nTenser's transformation is a sight guw- \n:eed to astound any creature not aware of its \n>ewer, for when the wizard casts the 4, \nle undergoes a startling transformation. \nIhe size and strength of the wizard in- \no heroic proportions, so he becomes a for- \nnidable fighting machine; the spell causes- \nhe caster to become a berserk fighter!
