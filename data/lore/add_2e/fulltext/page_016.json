Non-warrior char- \nacters who have Constitution scores of 17 or \n18 receive only +2 per die. \nThe Constitution bonus ends when a \ncharacter reaches 10th level (9th for war- \nriors and priests)-neither the Constitution \nbonus nor Hit Dice are added to a charac- \nter‘s hit points after he has passed this level \n(see the character class descriptions that \nstart on page 25). \nIf a character‘s Constitution changes dur- \ning the course of adventuring, his hit points \nmay be adjusted up or down to reflect the \nchange. The difference between the charac- \nter’s current hit point bonus (if any) and the \nnew bonus is multiplied by the character’s \nlevel (up to 10) and added to or subtracted \nfrom the character’s total. If Delsenora‘s \nConstitution increased from 16 to 17, she \nwould gain 1 hit point for every level she \nhad, up to 10th level. \nSystem Shock states the percentage \nchance a character has to survive magical \neffects that reshape or age his body: petrifi- \ncation (and reversing petrification), poly- \nmorph, magical aging, etc. It can also be \nused to see if the character retains con- \nsciousness in particularly difficult situa- \ntions. For example, an evil mage \npolymorphs his dim-witted hireling into a \ncrow. The hireling, whose Constitution \nscore is 13, has an 85 percent chance to sur- \nvive the change. Assuming he survives, he \nmust successfully roll for system shock \nagain when he is changed back to his origi- \nnal form or else he will die. \nResurrection Survival lists a character‘s \npercentage chance to be successfully resur- \nrected or raised from death by magic. The \nplayer must roll the listed number or less on \npercentile dice for the character to be \nrevived. If the dice roll fails, the character is \ndead, regardless of how many times he has \npreviously been revived. Only divine inter- \nvention can bring such a character back \nagain. \nPoison Save modifies the saving throw \nvs. poison for humans, elves, gnomes, and \nhalf-elves. Dwarves and halflings do not use \nthis adjustment, since they have special \nresistances to poison attacks. The DM has \nspecific information on saving throws. \nRegeneration enables those with special- \nly endowed Constitutions (perhaps by a \nwish or magical item) to heal at an advanced \nrate, regenerating damage taken. The char- \nacter heals 1 point of damage after the pas- \nsage of the listed number of turns. However, \nfire and acid damage (which are more exten- \nsive than normal wounds) cannot be regen- \nerated in this manner. These injuries must \nheal normally or be dealt with by magical \nmeans. \nTable 3: CONSTITUTION \n7 0 55 % 60 % 0 Nil \n8 0 60% 65 % 0 Nil \n13 0 85 % 90 % 0- - Nil \n14 0 88 % 92 % 0 Nil ~ \n15 +1 90 % 94 % 0 Nil \n* Parenthetical bonus applies to warriors only. All other classes receive maximum bonus \n** All Is rolled for Hit Dice are automatically considered 2s. \n*** All 1s and 2s rolled for Hit Dice are automatically considered 3s. \n**** All Is, 2s. and 3s rolled for Hit Dice are automatically considered 4s. \nof +2 per die. \nlntelllgence \nIntelligence (Int) \nrepresents a character’s memory, reasoning, \nand learning ability, including areas outside \nthose measured by the written word. Intelli- \ngence dictates the number of languages a \ncharacter can learn. htelligence is the prime \nrequisite of wizards, who must have keen \nminds to understand and memorize magical \nspells. A wizard with ag Intelligence score \nof 16 or higher gains a 10 percent bonus to \nexperience points earned. The wizards \nIntelligence dictates which spells he can \nlearn and the number of spells he can memo- \nrize at one time. Only those of the highest \nIntelligence can comprehend the mighty \nmagic of 9th-level spells. \nThis ability gives only a general indica- \ntion of a character’s mental acuity. A semi- \nintelligent character (Int 3 or 4) can speak \n(with difficulty) and is apt to react instinc- \ntively and impulsively. He is not hopeless as \na player character (PC), but playing such a \ncharacter correctly is not easy. A character \nwith low Intelligence (Int 5-7) could also be \ncalled dull-witted or slow. A very intelligent \nperson (Int 11 or 12) picks up new ideas \nquickly and learns easily. A highly intelli- \ngent character (Int 13 or 14) is one who can \nsolve most problems without even trying \n15 \nvery hard. One with exceptional intelli- \ngence (Int 15 or 16) is noticeably above the \nnorm. A genius character is bri&nt (Int 17 \nor 18). A character beyond geniw is puten- \ntially more clever and more brilliant than \ncan possibly be imagined. \nHowever, the true capabilities of a mind \nlie not in numbers-I.Q., Intelligence scorn, \nor whatever. Many intelligent, even bril- \nliant, people in the real world fail to apply \ntheir minds creatively and usefully, thus \nfalling far below their own potential. Don’t \nrely too heavily on your character’s Intelli- \ngence score; you must provide your chuac- \nter with the creativity and energy he \nsupposedly posSesseSI \nNumber of -p lists the number of \nadditional languages the character can \nspeak beyond his native language. Every \ncharacter can speak his native language, no \nmatter what his InteEligence is. This knowl- \nedge extends only to speaking the language; \nit does nof include reading or writing. The \nDM must decide if your character begins the \ngame already knowing these additional lan- \nguages or if the number shows only how \nmany languages your character can possi- \nbly learn. The first choice will make com- \nmunication easier, while the second \nincreases your opportunities for role- \nDlaving (finding a tutor or creating a rewon"
