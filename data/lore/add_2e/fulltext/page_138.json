    "text": "noticed by someone using magic detection. \nFurthermore, the caster can specify the type \nof magical aura that is detected (alteration, \nconjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks \nthe item's actual aura, if any, unless the \nitem's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if \nit is an artifact, for instance). If the object \nbearing Nystulk magical aura has an iden- \ntify spell cast on it or is similarly examined, \nthe examiner has a 50 % chance of recogniz- \ning that the aura has been placed to mislead \nthe unwary. Otherwise, the aura is believed \nand no amount of testing reveals what the \ntrue magic is. \nThe component for this spell is a small \nsquare of silk, which must be passed over \nthe object that receives the aura. \nPhantasmal Force (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nAreaofEffect:4OOsq.ft. + lOOsq.ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates the illusion of any \nobject, creature, or force, as long as it is \nwithin the boundaries of the spell's area of \neffect. The illusion is visual and affects all \nbelieving creatures (undead are immune) \nthat view it. It does not create sound, smell, \nor temperature. Effects that depend on these \nsenses usually fail. The illusion lasts until \nstruck by an opponent-unless the spell- \ncaster causes the illusion to react \nappropriately-or until the wizard ceases \nconcentration upon the spell (due to desire, \nmoving, or a successful attack that causes \ndamage). Saving throws for illusions are \nexplained under Illusion in the Magic chap- \nter (page 80) and on page 130. Creatures \nthat disbelieve the illusion see it for what it \nis and add +4 to dates' saving throws if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures believing the illusion are \nsubject to its effects, again as explained \nunder Illusions. \nThe illusionary effect can be moved by \nthe caster within the limits of the areatof \neffect. The DM has to rule on the effective- \nness of this spell; detailed guidelines are out- \nlined on page 130 and in Chapter 7: Magic. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of fleece. \nProtectlon From Evil (Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nCompone ts: V, S, M \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, it creates a magical \nbarrier around the recipient at a distance of \none foot. The barrier moves with the recipi- \nent and has three major effects: \nFirst, all attacks made by evil (or evilly \nenchanted) creatures against the protected \ncreature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; \nany saving throws caused by such attacks \nare made with +2 bonuses. \nSecond, any attempt to possess (as by a \nmagic jar attack) or to exercise mental con- \ntrol over (as by a vampire's charm ability) \nthe protected creature is blocked by this \nspell. Note that the protection does not pre- \nvent a vampire's charm itself, but it does \nprevent the exercise of mental control \nthrough the barrier. Likewise, a possessing \nlife force is merely kept out. It would not be \nexpelled if in place before the protection is \ncast. \nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact \nby creatures of an extraplanar or conjured \nnature (such as aerial servants, element&, \nimps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water \nweirds, xom, and others). This causes the \nnatural (body) weapon attacks of such crea- \ntures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if \nsuch attacks require touching the protected \nbeing. Animals or monsters summoned or \nconjured by spells or similar magic are like- \nwise hedged from the character. \nThis protection ends if the protected char- \nacter makes a melee attack against or tries to \nforce the barrier against the blocked crea- \nture. \nTo complete this spell, the wizard must \ntrace a three-footdiameter circle on the \nfloor (or ground) with powdered silver. \nThis spell can be reversed to become pro- \ntection from good; the second and third \nbenefits remaining unchanged. The material \ncomponent for the reverse is a circle of pow- \ndered iron. \nDuration: z rounddlevel \nRead Magic (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of a read magic spell, the wiz- \nard is able to read magical inscriptions on \nobjects-books, scrolls, weapons, and the \nlike-that would otherwise be totally unin- \ntelligible. (The personal books of the wiz- \n137 \nard, and works already magically read, gre \nintelligible.) This deciphering does not nor- \nmally invoke the magic contained in the \nwriting, although it may do so in the case of \na cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell \nis cast and the wizard has read the magical \ninscription, he is thereafter able to read that \nparticular writing without recourse to the \nuse of the read magic spell. The duration of \nthe spell is two rounds per level of experi- \nence of the spellcaster; the wizard can read \none page or its equivalent per round. \nThe wizard must have a clear crystal or \nmineral prism, which is not expended, to \ncast the spell. \nShield (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, an invisible barrier \ncomes into being in front of the wizard. This \nshield totally negates magic missile attacks. \nIt provides the equivalent protection of AC \njavelins, spears, etc.), AC 3 against small \ndevice-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, \nbullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), \nand AC 4 against all other form of attack. \nThe shield also adds a + 1 bonus to the wiz- \nards saving throws against attacks that are \nbasically frontal. Note that these benefits \napply only if the attacks originate from in \nfront of the wizard, where the shield can \nmove to interpose itself. \n2 against hand-hurled missiles (=a, darts, \nShocking Grasp (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard casts this spell, he \ndevekqm a powerful electrical charge tkat \ngives a jolt to the creature toucbi. Thc \nspell remains in effect for one rod act; \nlevel of the caster or until it is diochorgedbg \nthe caster touching another cream. The \nshocking grasp delivers Id8 points of dara \nage, plus 1 point per level of the wizard \n(e.g., a 2nd-level wizard wvuld discharge a \nshock causing Id8 +2 points of damage). \nWhiie the wizard must come close enough \nto his opponent to lay a hand on the oppo- \nnent's body or upon an electrical conductor \nthat touches the opponent's body, a like \ntouchfrom the opponent does not discharge \nthe spell."
