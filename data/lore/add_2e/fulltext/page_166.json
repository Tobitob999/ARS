If any viewer successfully disbe- \nlieves and communicates this fact to other \nviewers, each such viewer gains a saving \nthrow vs. spell with a +4 bonus. \nThe material components are a bit of \nfleece and several grains of sand. \nAi- Water (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 10‘ radius sphere or \nSaving Throw: None \nThe airy water spell turns normal liquid, \nsuch as water or water-based solutions, into \na less dense, breathable substance. Thus, if \nthe wizard wanted to enter an underwater \nplace, he would step into the water, cast the \nspell and sink downward in a globe of bub- \nbling water. He and any companions in the \nspells area of effect can move freely and \nbreathe just as if the bubbling water were \nair. The globe is centered on and moves with \nthe caster. Water-breathing creatures avoid \na sphere (or hemisphere) of airy water, al- \nthough intelligent ones can enter it if they \nare able to move by means other than swim- \nming. No water-breathers can breathe in an \narea affected by this spell. There is only one \nword that needs to be spoken to actuate the \nmagic, thus it can be cast underwater. The \nspell does not filter or remove solid particles \nof matter. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall handful of alkaline or bromine salts. \n15’ radius hemisphere \nAnimal Growth (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nArea of Effect: UP to 8 animals in \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard causes \nall designated animals, up to a maximum of \neight, within a 2Gfoot-square area to grow \nto twice their normal size. The effects of this \ngrowth are doubled Hit Dice (with improve- \nment in attack rolls) and doubled damage in \ncombat. The spell lasts for one round for \neach level of experience of the wizard cast- \ning the spell. Only natural animals, includ- \ning giant forms, can be affected by this spell. \nThe reverse, shrink animal, reduces ani- \nmal size by half and likewise reduces Hit \nDice, attack damage, etc. \nThe component of both versions of the \nspell is a pinch of powdered bone. \nAnimate Dead (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates the lowest of the undead \nmonsters-skeletons or zombies-usually \nfrom the bones or bodies of dead humans, \ndemihumans, or humanoids. The spell \ncauses existing remains to become animated \nand obey the simple verbal commands of \nthe caster. The skeletons or zombies can fol- \nlow the caster, remain in an area and attack \nany creature (or just a specific type of crea- \nture) entering the place, etc. The undead re- \nmain animated until they are destroyed in \ncombat or are turned; the magic cannot be \ndispelled. The following types of dead crea- \ntures can be animated: \nA) Humans, demihumans, and human- \noids with 1 Hit Die. The wizard can animate \none skeleton for each experience level he has \nattained, or one zombie for every two \nlevels. The experience levels, if any, of the \nslain are ignored: the body of a newly dead \n9th-level fighter is animated as a zombie \nwith 2 Hit Dice, without special class or ra- \ncial abilities. \nB) Creatures with more than 1 Hit Die. \nThe number of undead animated is deter- \nmined by the monster Hit Dice (the total Hit \nDice cannot exceed the wizards level). Skel- \netal forms have the Hit Dice of the original \ncreature, while zombie forms have one \nmore Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level wizard \ncould animate four zombie gnolls (4 x [2 + \n1 Hit Dice] = 121, or a single fire giant skele- \nton. Such undead have none of the special \nabilities they had in life. \nC) Creatures with less than 1 Hit Die. The \ncaster can animate two skeletons per level \nor one zombie per level. The creatures have \ntheir normal Hit Dice as skeletons and an \nadditional Hit Die as zombies, Clerics re- \nceive a + 1 bonus when trying to turn these. \nThis spell assumes that the bodies or \nbones are available and are reasonably in- \ntact (those of skeletons or zombies de- \nstroyed in combat won’t bel). \nIt requires a drop of blood and a pinch of \nbone powder or a bone shard to complete \nthe spell. The casting of this spell is not a \ngood act and only evil wizards use it fre- \nquently. \n1 \nAvoidance (Abjuration, Alte - \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, s, M \nDuration: Permanent until dispel \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Up to 3-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \ntive mass of the two (a halfling attempting \nto touch an iron chest with an avoidance \ncreature as the creature approaches). \nThe material component for the spell is a \nmagnetized needle. The spell cannot be cast \nupon living things; any attempt to cast \navoidance upon the apparel or possessions \nof a living creature entitles the subject ma- \nture to a saving throw vs. spell. \nThe reverse of this spell, attraction, uses \nthe same material components and sets up a \nnatural attraction between the affected ob- \nject and aIl living things. A creature is \ndrawn to the object if the mature is smaller; \nor the object slides toward the creature if the \ncreature is larger. A successful bend bars roll \nmust be rolled to remove the enchanted ob- \nject once it has adhered to an object or ma- \nture. \nBigby’s Interposing Hand \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \ngargantuan-sized magical hand that appears \nbetween the spellcaster and his chosen op \nponent. This disembodied hand then moves \nto remain between the two, regardless of \nwhat the spellcaster does or how the oppo- \nnent tries to get around it. Neither invisibil- \nity nor polymorph fools the hand once a \ncreature has been chosen. The hand does \nnot pursue an opponent, nor does it move \nmore than ten feet away from the caster \nThe size of the hand is determined b~ __._ \nwizard, and it can be human-sized (five feet) \nall the way up to titan-sized (25 feet). It pro- \nvides cover for the caster against the se- \nlected opponent, with all the attendant \ncombat adjustments. It has as many hit \npoints as the caster in full healthand has an \nArmor Class of 0. \nBigby‘s interposing hand is a man+="
