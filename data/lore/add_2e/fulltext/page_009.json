    "text": "Welcome to the Second Edition AD&D@ Game - \nI \nYou are reading the key to the most exciting \nhobby in the world-role-playing games. \nThese first few pages will introduce yo \nto the second edition of the most successfr. \nrole-playing game ever published. If you ar \na novice role-player, stop right here an1 \nreadzhe section labeled The Real Basics (01 \nthe next page). When you understand wha \nrole-playing and the AD&P game are a1 \nabout, come back to this point and read thl \nrest of the introduction. If you are an experi \nenced role-player, skip The Real Basics. \nWhy a Second Edition? \nBefore answerin! \nthat question, let‘s define what the seconc \nedition of the AD&D game is and is not. \nThis second edition of the AD&D game is \na lot different from the first edition. Thc \npresentation of the game has been cleanec \nup. The rules are reorganized, clarified, anc \nstreamlined. Where necessary, things that \ndidn’t work have been fixed. Things that did \nwork haven‘t been changed. \nThe second edition of the AD&D game is \nnot a statement of what any one person \nthinks the game should be. It is the result of \nmore than three years of discussion, \nthought, consultation, review, and play- \ntesting. \nNow to the question of ”Why a second \nedition’l” The AD&D game evolved over \nthe course of 16 years. During that time, the \ngame grew tremendously through play. \nChanges and improvements (and a few mis- \ntakes) were made. These were published in \nsubsequent volumes. By 1988, the game \nconsisted of 12 hardcover rule books. It was \nphysically and intellectually unwieldy (but \nstill a lot of fun). The time was right to reor- \nganize and recombine all that information \ninto a manageable package. That package is \nthe second edition. \nHow the Rule Books \narc Organized \nThe AD&D game \nrule books are intended primarily as refer- \nence ,books. They are designed so any spe- \ncific rule can be found quickly and easily \nduring a game. \nEverything a player needs to know is in \nthe Player’s Handbook. That’s not to say \nthat all the rules are in this book. But every \nrule that a player needs to know in order to \nplay the game is in this book. \nA few rules have been reserved for the \nDungeon Master’s Guide (DMG). These \neither cover situations that very seldom \narise or give the Dungeon Master (DM) \ninformation that players should not have \nbeforehand. Everything else in the DMG is \ninformation that only the Dungeon Master \nneeds. If the DM feels that players need to \nknow something that is explained in th \nDMG, he will tell them. \nLike the DMG, the Monstrous Compen \ndium is the province of the DM. This give \ncomplete and detailed information abou \nthe monsters, people, and other creature \ninhabiting the AD&D world. Some DM \ndon‘t mind if players read this information \nbut the game is more fun if players don‘ \nknow everything about their foes-i \nheightens the sense of discovery and dange: \nof the unknown. \nLearning the Game \nIf you have playa \nthe AD&D game before, you know almosi \neverything you need to play the second edi- \ntion. We advise you to read the entire Play- \ner’s Handbook, but the biggest changes are \nin these chapters: Character Classes, Com- \nbat, and Experience. Be sure to read at least \nthose three chapters before sitting down to \nplay. \nIf you come to a term you do not under- \nstand, look for it in the Glossary, which \nbegins on page 11. \nIf you have never played the AD&D \ngame before, the best way to learn to play \nthe game is to find a group of experienced \nplayers and join them. They can get you \nimmediately into the game and explain \nthings as you need to know them. You don’t \nneed to read anything beforehand. In fact, \nit’s best if you can play the game for several \nhours with experienced players before read- \ning any of the rules. One of the truly mar- \nvelous things about a role-playing game is \nthat even though the concept is difficult to \nexplain, it is simple to demonstrate. \nIf none of your friends are involved in a \ngame, the best place to find experienced \nplayers is through your local hobby store. \nRole-playing and general gaming clubs are \ncommon and are always eager to accept \nnew members. Many hobby stores offer a \nbulietin board through which DMs can \nadvertise for new players and new players \n:an ask for information about new or ongo- \nng games. If there is no hobby store in your \nuea, check at the local library or school. \nIf you can’t find anyone else who knows \nhe AD&D game, you can teach yourself. \ntead the Player’s Handbook and create \n,ome characters. Try to create a variety of \n:haracter classes. Then pick up a pre- \npackaged adventure module for low-level \n*haracters, round up two or three friends, \nmd dive into it. You probably will make lots \nIf mistakes and wonder constantly whether \nIOU are doing everything wrong. Even if \n‘ou are, don‘t worry about it. The ADkD \name is big, but eventually you’ll bring it \nnder control. \n8 \nThe Second Edition \nADbD Game Line \nQuite a few books \nand other products are published for the \nAD&D game. As a player, you need only \none of them-this book. Every player and \nDM should have a copy of the Player’s \nHandbook. Everything else is either option- \nal or intended for the Dungeon Master. \nThe Dungeon Master’s Guide is essential \nfor the DM and it is for the DM only. Play- \ners who are not themselves DMs have no \ncause to read the DMG. \nThe Monstrous Compendium is not one, \nbut several products. The book can be \nexpanded whenever new compendiums are \nreleased. The first pack o€ monsters is essen- \ntial to the game. It indudes the most com- \nmonly encountered monsters, mythical \nbeasts, and legendary creatures. Additional \npacks expand on these monsters and give \nthe game more variety. Specialty \ncompendiums-those for Greyhawk, the \nForgotten Realms, Kara-Tur, etc.-are high- \nly recommended for DMs who play in those \nsettings. \nExpanded character class books-The \nComplete Fighter, The Complete Thief, \netc.-provide a lot more detail on these \ncharacter classes than does the Player’s \nHandbook. These books are entirely \noptional. They are for those players who \nreally want a world of choice for their char- \nacters. \nAdventure modules contain complete \ngame adventures. These are especially use- \nful for DMs who aren’t sure how to create \ntheir own adventures and for DMs who \nneed an adventure quickly and don’t have \ntime to write one of their own. \nA Note About Pronouns \nThe male pronoun \n‘he, him, his) is used exclusively throughout \n,he second edition of the ADkD game rules. \nNe hope this won‘t be construed by anyone \no be an attempt to exclude females from the \n:ame or imply their exclusion. Centuries of \nise have neutered the male pronoun. In \nwitten material it is clear, concise, and \namiliar. Nothing else is. \nCreating a Character \nTo create a charac- \nter to play in the AD&D game, proceed, in \norder, through Chapters 1 through 6. \n(Chapter 5 is optional). These chapters will \ntell you how to generate your character‘s \nability scores, race, and class, decide on his \nalignment, pick proficiencies, and buy \nequipment. Once you have done all this, \nyour character is ready for adventure!"
