    "text": "Priest Spells (4th Level) \nspell: the creature moves at half speed and \nmakes half its usual number of attacks each \nround. The spell has no effect on other crea- \ntures. \nIts reverse, raise water, causes water or \nsimilar fluids to return to their highest natu- \nral level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This \ncan make fords impassable, float grounded \nships, and may even sweep away bridges at \nthe DMs option. It negates lower water and \nvice versa. \nThe material components of this spell are \nthe priest’s holy (or unholy) symbol and a \npinch of dust. \nPOI- (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched or 1 cubic \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of a neutralize poison spell, the \npriest detoxifies any sort of venom in the \ncreature or substance touched. Note that an \nopponent, such as a poisonous reptile or \nsnake (or even an envenomed weapon of an \nopponent) unwilling to be so touched \nrequires the priest to roll a successful attack \nin combat. This spell can prevent death in a \npoisoned creature if cast before death \noccurs. The effects of the spell are perma- \nnent only with respect to poison existing in \nthe touched creature at the time of the \ntouch, thus creatures (and objects) that gen- \nerate new poison are not permanently \ndetoxified . \nThe reversed spell, poison, likewise \nrequires an attack roll that succeeds, and the \nvictim is allowed a saving throw vs. poison. \nIf the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is \nincapacitated and dies in one turn unless the \npoison is magically neutralized or slowed. \nfoot of substancel2 levels \nnurt Door (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe pht door spell opens a magical portal \nor passageway through trees, undergrowth, \nthickets, or any similar growth-even \ngrowth of a magical nature. The plant door \nis open to the caster who cast the spell, cast- \ners of a higher level, or dryads; others must \nbe shown the location of the door. The door \neven enables the caster to enter a solid tree \ntrunk and remain hidden there until the \nspell ends. The spell also enables the passage \nor hiding of any man-sized or smaller crea- \nture; hiding is subject to space consider- \nations. If the tree is cut down or burned, \nthose within must leave before the tree falls \nor is consumed, or else they are killed also. \nThe duration of the spell is one turn per level \nof experience of the caster. If the caster opts \nto stay within an oak, the spell lasts nine \ntimes longer, if in an ash tree, it lasts three \ntimes longer than normal. The path created \nby the spell is up to four feet wide, eight feet \nhigh, and 12 feet long per level of experience \nof the caster. This spell does not function on \nplant-based monsters-e.g., shambling \nmounds, molds, slimes, treants, etc. \nThe material components for this spell are \na piece of charcoal and the caster’s holy \nsymbol. \nProduce Fire (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 40 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 12- \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster causes a \ncommon fire of up to 12 feet per side in area. \nThough it lasts but a single round, unless it \nignites additional flammable material, the \nfire produced by the spell inflicts ld4 points \nof damage plus 1 point per caster level (ld4 \n+ Mevel) upon creatures within its area. It \nignites combustible materials, such as cloth, \noil, paper, parchment, wood, and the like, \nso as to cause continued burning. \nThe reverse, quench fire, extinguishes \nany normal fire (coals, oil, tallow, wax, \nwood, etc.) within the area of effect. \nThe material component for either ver- \nsion is a paste of sulfur and wax, formed \ninto a ball and thrown at the target. \nProtection From Evll, 10’ Radius \n(Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThe globe of protection of this spell is \nidentical in all respects to that of a protec- \ntion from evil spell, except that it encom- \npasses a much larger area and its duration is \ngreater. The effect is centered on and moves \nwith the creature touched. Any protected \nI \ncreature within the circle will break the \nwarding against enchanted/summoned \nmonsters if he attacks those monsters. A \ncreature unable to fit completely into the \narea of effect (for example, a 21-foot-tall \ntitan) remains partially exposed and subject \nto whatever penalties the DM decides. If \nsuch a creature is the recipient of the spell, \nthe spell acts as a normal protection from \nevil spell for that creature only. \nThe reverse, protection from good, 10’ \nradius, wards against good creatures. \nTo complete this spell, the priest must \ntrace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy \n(or unholy) water and incense (or smolder- \ning dung), according to the protection from \nevil spell. \nProtection From Ughtnlng \n(Ab juration) \nSphere: Protection, Weather \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe effect of a protection from lightning \nspell changes depending on who is the recip- \nient of the magic-the caster or some other \ncreature. In either case, the spell lasts no \nlonger than one turn per caster level. \n* If the spell is cast upon the caster, it \nconfers complete invulnerability to electri- \ncal attack such as dragon breath, or magical \nlightning such as lightning bolt, shocking \ngrasp, storm giant, will ‘0 wisp, etc., until \nthe spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical \ndamage per level of the caster, at which time \nthe spell is negated. \n* If the spell is cast upon another crea- \nture, it gives a bonus of + 4 to the die roll for \nsaving throws made vs. electrical attacks, \nand it reduces the damage sustained from \nsuch attacks by 50%. \nThe caster’s holy symbol is the material \ncomponent. \nReflecting Pool (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 hours \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to cause a \npool of normal water found in a natural set- \nting to act as a scrying device. The pool can \nbe of no greater diameter than two feet per \nlevel of the caster. The effect is to create a \nscrying device similar to a crystal ball. The \n219"
