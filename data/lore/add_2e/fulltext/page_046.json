    "text": "-s \nZnd-level,thief. (He will also roll Idlo and \nId4 [both rolls divided by 31 whep he \nreaches 2nd level 11s a fighter and as a mage, \nrespectively.) \nMulti-class characters can combine abili- \nties from their different classes with the fol- \nlowing restrictions: \nWarrior. A multi-classed warrior can use \nall of his abilities without restriction. The \nwarrior abilities form the base for other \ncharacter classes. \nPriest: Regardless of his other classes, a \nmulti-classed priest must abide by the \nweapon restrictions of his mythos. Thus, a \nfighter/cleric can use only bludgeoning \nweapons (but he uses the warrior combat \nvalue). He retains all his normal priest abili- \nties. \nWizard: A multi-classed wizard can \nfreely combine the powers of the wizard \nwith any other class allowed, although the \nwearing of armor is restricted. Elves wear- \ning elven chain can cast spells in armor, as \nmagic is part of the nature of elves. How- \never, elven chain is extremely rare and can \nnever be purchased. It must be given, \nfound, or won. \nThief: A multi-classed thief cannot use \nany thieving abilities other than open locks \nor detect noise if he is wearing armor that is \nnormally not allowed to thieves. He must \nremove his gauntlets to open locks and his \nhelmet to detect noise. \n' - \nDual-Class Bencflts and Restrictions \nOnly humans can \nw dual-classed characters. To be dual- \nclassed, the character must have scores of 15 \nor more in the prime requisites of his first \nclass and scores of 17 or more in the prime \nrequisites of any classes he switches to. The \ncharacter selects one class to begin his ad- \nventuring life. He can advance in this ciass \nas many levels as he desires before switching \nto another class; there is no cut-off point be- \nyond which a character cannot switch. \nHowever, he must attain at least 2nd level in \nhis current class before changing to another \nclass. There is no limit to the number of \nclasses a character can acquire, as long as he \nhas the ability scores and wants to make the \nchange. (Certain character classes have \nalignment restrictions that the character \nmust meet, however.) \nAny time after reaching 2nd level, a hu- \nman character can enter a new character \nclass, provided he has scores of 17 or better \nin the prime requisites of the new class. Af- \nter switching to a new class, the character \nno longer earns experience points in his pre- \nvious character class and he can no longer \nadvance in level in that class. Nor can he \nswitch back to his first class at a later date, \nhoping to resume his advancement where he \nleft off. Once he leaves a class he has fin- \nished his studies in it. Instead, he starts over \nin a new class, at 1st level with 0 experience \npoints, but he does retain his previous Hit \nDice and hit points. He gains the abilities, \nand must abide by a11 of the restrictions, of \nthe new class. He does not gain or lose any \npoints on his ability scores (e.g., an 18 \nStrength mage who changes to fighter does \nnot gain the percentile Strength bonus, but \nlikewise a fighter changing to a mage would \nnot lose it). The character uses the combat \nand saving throw tables appropriate to his \nnew class and level. \nThis is not to imply that a dualslass hu- \nman forgets everything he knew before; he \nstill has, at his fingertips, all the knowledge, \nabilities, and proficiencies of his old class. \nBut if he uses any of his previous class's abit- \nities during an encounter, he earns no expe- \nrience for that encounter and only half \nexperience for the adventure. The only val- \nues that can be carried over from the pre- \nvious class without restriction are the \ncharacter's Hit Dice and hit points. The \ncharacter is penalized for using his old at- \ntack or saving throw numbers, weapons or \narmor that are now prohibited, and any \nspecial abilities of the old class that are not \nalso abilities of the new class. (The charac- \nter is trying to learn new ways to do things; \nby slipping back to his old methods, he has \nset back his learning in his new character \nclass.) \nIn addition, the character earns no addi- \ntional Hit,Dice or hit points while advanc- \ning in his new class. \nThe restrictions in the previous two para- \ngraphs last until the character reaches a \nhigher level in his new class than his maxi- \nmum level in any of his previous classes. At \nthat point, both restrictions are dropped: \nthe character gains the abilities of his pre- \nvious classes without jeopardizing his \nexperience points for the adventure, and he \nearns additional Hit Dice (those of his new \nclass) and hit points for gaining experience \nlevels in his new class. \nOnce these restrictions are lifted, the \ncharacter must still abide by the restrictions \nof whichever class he is using at the mo- \nment. A dual-class fighter/mage, for exam- \nple, cannot cast spells while wearing armor. \nTarus Blood-heart begins his career'as a \ncleric with a Wisdom of 16. He rises to 3rd \nlevel and then decides to become a fighter, \nsince his Strength is 17. He keeps his 14 hit \npoints (rolled on 3d8), but in all other ways \nhe is treated as a 1st-level fighter, Upon \nreaching 4th level, Tarus is allowed to roll \nIdlo for additional hit points. He can now \ncast spells as a 3rd-level cleric and fight as a \n4th-level fighter, For the rest of his career, \nTarus advances as a fighter but retains his \nminor clerical powers-a useful advantage \nwhen the situation gets ugly! \n45"
