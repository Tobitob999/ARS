    "text": "Wizard Spells (2nd Level) \nevilly cursed object or unholy water radi- \nates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelli- \ngent viper does not. The degree of evil \n(faint, moderate, strong, overwhelming) \ncan be noted. Note that priests have a more \npowerful version of this spell. \nThe spell has a path of detection ten feet \nwide in the direction in which the mage is \nfacing. The wizard must concentrate-stop, \nhave quiet, and intently seek to detect the \naura-for at least one round to receive a \nreading. \nDetect invisibility (Divination) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: lefoot path \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard casts a detect inursibility \nspell, he is able to see clearly any objects or \nbeings that are invisible, as well as any that \nare astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addi- \ntion, it enables the wizard to detect hidden \nor concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in \nshadows, halflings in underbrush, and so \non). It does not reveal the method of con- \ncealment or invisibility, except in the case of \nastral travelers (where the silver cord can be \nseen). It does not reveal illusions or enable \nthe caster to see through physical objects. \nDetection is in the wizards line of sight \nalong a ten-foot-wide path to the range \nlimit. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of \npowdered silver. \nESP (Divination) \nRange: 5 yards/level, 90 yards maximum \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature per probe \nSaving Thrpw: None \nWhen an ESP spell is used, the caster is \nable to detect the surface thoughts of any \ncreatures in range-except for those of un- \ndead and creatures without minds (as we \nknow them). The ESP is stopped by two or \nmore feet of rock, two or more inches of any \nmetal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead \nfoil. The wizard employing the spell is able \nto probe the surface thoughts of one crea- \nture per round, getting simple instinctual \nthoughts from lower order creatures. \nProbes can continue on the same creature \nfrom round to round or can move on to \nother creatures. The caster can use the spell \nto help determine if a creature lurks behind \na door, for example, but the ESP does not al- \nways reveal what sort of creature it is. If \nused as part of a program of interrogation, \nan intelligent and wary subject receives an \ninitial saving throw. If successful, the crea- \nture successfully resists and the spell reveals \nno additional information. If the saving \nthrow is failed, the caster may learn addi- \ntional information, according to the DMs \nruling. The creature's Wisdom adjustment \napplies, as may additional bonuses up to \n+4, based on the sensitivity of the informa- \ntion sought. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ncopper piece. \nFlaming Sphere (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 3-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA flaming sphere spell creates a burning \nglobe of fire within ten yards of the caster. \nThis sphere rolls in whichever direction the \nwizard points, at a rate of 30 feet per round. \nIt rolls over barriers less than four feet tall, \nsuch as furniture, low walls, etc. Flammable \nsubstances are set afire by contact with the \nsphere. Creatures in contact with the globe \nmust successfully save vs. spell or suffer 2d4 \npoints of fire damage. Those within five feet \nof the sphere's surface must also save or suf- \nfer ld4 points of heat damage. A successful \nsaving throw means no damage is suffered. \nThe DM may adjust the saving throws if \nthere is little or no room to dodge the \nsphere. \nThe sphere moves as long as the spell- \ncaster actively directs it, otherwise it merely \nstays at rest and bums. It can be extin- \nguished by the same means as any normal \nfire of its size. The surface of the sphere has \na spongy, yielding consistency and so does \nnot cause damage except by its flame. It can- \nnot push unwilling creatures aside or batter \ndown large obstacles. \nThe material components are a bit of tal- \nlow, a pinch of sulphur, and a dusting of \npowdered iron. \nFog Cloud (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe fog cloud spell can be cast in either \none of two ways, at the caster's option: as a \nlarge, stationary bank of normal fog, or as a \nharmless fog that resembles the 5th-level \nwizard spell, cloudkill. \nAs a fog bank, this spell creates a fog of \nany size and shape up to a maximum 20-foot \ncube per caster level. The fog obscures all \n141 \nsight, normal and infravision, beyond two \nfeet. \ninto the vegetation. \nscure vision. A strong breeze \neither effect in one round, whil \nbreeze will reduce the spell \n50%. The spell cannot be cast \nThe only effect of either version is to ob- \nFools' Gold (Alteration, Illusion) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 10 cu. in./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nCopper coins can temporarily be changed \nto gold pieces, or brass items turned to solid \ngold, for the spell duration by means of this \nmagic. The area of effect is ten cubic inches \nper level-i.e., a 1\" x 1\" x 10\" volume or \nequivalent, equal to about 150 gold coins. \nAny creature viewing the \"gold is entitled \nto a saving throw vs. spell, which can be \nmodified by the creature's Wisdom; for ev- \nery level of the wizard, the creature must \nsubtract 1 from his dice roll. Thus it is un- \nlikely that fools' gold will be detected if it \nwas created by a high-level caster. If the \n\"gold is struck hard by an object of cold- \nwrought iron, there is a slight chance it will \nrevert to its natural state, depending on the \nmaterial component used to create the - \n\"gold.\" If a 25-gp citrine is powdered and \nsprinkled over the metal as this spell is cast, \nthe chance that cold iron will return it to its \ntrue nature is 30%; if a 50-m amber stone is \npowdered and used, there is a 25% chance \nthat iron will dispel the magic; if a 2Sgp \ntopaz is powdered, the chance drops to \n10%; if a 500-g~ oriental (corundum) topaz \nis powdered, there is only a 1 % chance that \nthe cold iron will reveal that it is fools' gold. \nth .\\"
