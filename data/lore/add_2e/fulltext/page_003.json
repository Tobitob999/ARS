    "text": "ecial Thanks To: \nA vast work like the AD&W 2nd Edition \ngame doesn't spring into being from nothing. Especially not in this \ncase, since this is the 2nd Edition of the game. The AD&D game \nowes its existence the efforts of many people. \nThe AD&D game probably never would have existed without the \nwork of Gary Gygax and Dave Ameson. Together they introduced \nthe world to the concept of role-playing games. Their efforts \nresulted in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS\" game, forerunner of \nthe AD&D system. Gary Gygax then went on to be the principal \ncreator and guiding force of the AD&D rules. His particular vision \nset the standards for what the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & \nDRAGONS\" game was-and what it wasn't. \nA game such as the AD&D game, or any role-playing game, is \nuch more than the work of just one man. Many others have writ- \nten rule books, contributed ideas, playtested, criticized, and added \ntheir own personal interpretations of what the game is. For their \nefforts, they too deserve credit. New rule books were written by \nDavid \"Zeb\" Cook (Oriental Adventures), Jeff Grubb (Manual of \nthe Planes), Tracy Hickman (DRAGONLANCF' Adventures), Kim \nMohan (Wilderness Sumival Guide), Douglas Niles (Dungeoneerk \nSuruival Guide), Jim Ward (Legends and Lore, GREYHAWK@ \nAdventures), and Margaret Weis (DRAGONLANCF' Adven- \ntures). \nOver the years, there have been many people who have written \nrules, edited manuscripts, offered suggestions, and playtested. With \nan undertaking as large as the AD&D game, this list is long, but \neach of these people deserves mention for his or her efforts. While \nthere is not enough space to mention exactly what each person did, \neach has been important to the development of the game. Mark \nAcres, Peter Aronson, Jim Bambra, Brian Blume, Mike Breadt, \nMike Carr, Sean Cleary, Troy Denning, Michael Dobson, Jean- \nLouis Fiasson, Joe Fischer, Ed Greenwood, Ernie Gygax, Luke \nGygax, Mary Gygax, Allen Hammack, Neal Healey, Kevin Hen- \ndryx, J.

It can never be \ncomplete. The AD&D game is continually evolving-each player \nand each DM adds his own touch to the whole. No list of special \nthanks can be complete without recognizing the most important \ncontributors of all-the millions of players who, over the years, \nhave made the AD&D game what it is today. \n' \nCredits \n2nd Edition design: David \"Zeb Cook \nDevelopment: Steve Winter and Jon Pickens \nPlaytest Coordination: Jon Pickens \nEditing: MikeBreault \nProofreadins Jean Black, Curtis Smith, and James Ward \nTypesetting Kim Janke, Linda Bakk, Betty Elmore, and Angie Lokotz \nGraphic Deoign: Linda Bakk \nCover Illustration: Jeff Easley \nInterior Color Illustrations: Douglas Chaffee, Larry Elmore, Craig Farley, John h Laura \nInterior Black & White Illustrations: Jeff Butler, Douglas Chaffee, Jeff Easley, John & Laura \nKey- Colleen OMalley and Paul Hanchette \nLakey, Erik Olson, and Jack Pennington \nLakey, Jean E.
