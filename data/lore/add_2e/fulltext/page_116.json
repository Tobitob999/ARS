    "text": "NPCs (Followers) \nneeds to be done in this situation depends \nentirely upon the DMs campaign. Your \ncharacter may have to skulk through the \nunsavory bars.of the waterfront, rely on \nquestionable go-betweens, or pay a visit to \nthe thieves' guild (if there is one). Just \nemploying one of these characters can be a \nsmall adventure in itself. \nEmployment costs of hirelings vary from \na few gold pieces a month to thousands of \ngold pieces for an especially dangerous task. \nThe skill and experience of a hireling has a \ngreat effect on his salary. A learned sage \nresearching some obscure piece of lore can \ncharge hefty sums. Costs can also be affect- \ned by the conditions of the campaign-the \nsetting, the recent events of the world, and \nthe reputations of the player characters (if \nany). Most hirelings sign on for what they \nthink is fair. While few will turn down more \nmoney, most will drive the best bargain they \ncan. Your DM has more information about \nemployment costs, since he may need to \nalter these to fit his campaign. \nFoliowers \nMore reliable than \nthose who are motivated purely by money \nare those characters who, while they expect \npay, were originally drawn into service by \nthe reputation of the player character. These \nare followm, usually a unit of soldiers of \none type or another. Followers serve only \nthose of significant power and reputation, \nthus the construction of a stronghold is nec- \nessary to attract followers. \nFollowers have the same needs and limita- \ntions of hirelings. Most must be paid and \nwell-treated. They also do not accompany \nthe player characters on group adventures. \nThey have some advantages over hirelings, \nhowever. Followers do not serve for a spe- \ncific term of mtract. They remain with the \nplayer character as long as their basic needs \nare met. They are more loyal than the aver- \nage hireling and are treated as elite troops. \nUnlike most hirelings, followers can \nincrease in level (although this occurs very \nslowly since they act only as soldiers). All \nfollowers in a unit advance to the next level \nat the same time. Finally, the player charac- \nter need not seek out followers-they come \nto him, seeking positions within his illustri- \nous household. \nFollowers appear only once. Replace- \nments do not anive to fill the ranks of the \nfallen. (Massive losses of fol€owers in com- \nbat only gives the character a bad reputa- \ntion, discouraging others from flockiq to \nhis banner.) player characters should take \nthem as an elite bodyguard. \nSome characters attract unique followers \nsuch as animals or magical beings. \nAlthough termed followers, these creatures \nare more properly treated as henchmen in \ncare of their followers, perhaps treating \n115 \nterms of loyalty and what they will and will \nnot do. They do not count against the char- \nacter's limit on henchmen, however, since \nthey are technically followers. \nHenchmen \nHenchmen are much \nthat hirelings are not. They are adventurers \nwho serve out of loyalty. They are willing to \nrisk their lives for those they respect. They \nare also hard to find. \nHendunen are powerful allies to a player \ncharacter. Unlike hirelings, they have the \nnerve and ability to become powerful \nadventurers. Although they expect their \nshare of treasure, they do not usdy join a \nplayer character for money. They are \nattracted to the PC because of his reputation \nor other qualities he possesses. As such, \nhenchmen cannot be expected to flock to the \nbanner of a neophyte adventurer. He may \ngain himself one or two companions, but \nothers come only when he has earned a \ngreater reputation, met more people, and \nproven himself a true friend and ally to \nthese NPCs. \nHenchmen can come from any source. \nMost often they are at first mere hirelings or \nfollowers who, through distinctive actions, \ncome to the attention of the player charac- \nter. Some may be higher level, more skilled \nhirelings who develop a bond to the player \ncharacter through long employment. Oth- \ners may be followers who have sound \nadvice for the player character. \nA henchman is always of lower level than \nthe K. Should he ever equal or surpass the \nPCs level, the henchman leaves forever; it is \ntime for him to try his luck in the real world. \nIn some ways, the player character is the \nmentor arid the henchman his student. \nWhen the studmt has kamed as much as the \nteacher, it is time for him to go out on his \nHenchmen are more thitn just loyal fol- \nlowers; they are friends and allies. Natu- \nrally they expect to be treatedassuch. They \nhave little need for those who do not trust \nthem or treat them coldly. Abusiveness or \ntaking advantage of the friendshp quickly \nends the relathship. Just as players must \nwith their own friends, player characters \nmust be sensitive to the needs and feelinsa of \ntheir henchmen. Furthermore, henchmen \nattach thentselves to a particular player \ncharacter, not a group of player characters. \nThus it is only under the direst of circum- \nstances that a hendunan accepts the orders \nof another PC. Should his friend (the player \ncharacter) fall, the henchman sees to his \nneeds. He doesn't abandon him and con- \ntinue on with the other player characters \nunless this is dearly the only way to aid his \nfriend. \nA PC's Charisma determines the maxi- \nmum number of henchmen he can have. \nown. \nfor one reason or another. \nThere are certain things henchmen do not \ndo. They do not give away or loan out nag- \nical items. They do not allow ob free \naccess to their spell books. They do not toi- \nerate spell use that questions their loyalty \n(detect lie or know alignment cast upolr \nthem). They do not accept less than their \ndue share. ln general, within these limits, \nhenchman do what is desired of tkm. The \nDM can at any time dictate the adions of a \nhenchman, since the character is still an \nNPC. \nIf a PC is not attentive to the wishes and \nneeds of his henchmen, or if he abuses and \nhumiliates thcm, he can expect the worst. \nThis is the stuff mutinies and rebellions are \nmade of. Should an abusive player charac- \nter fall at the hands of a once-loyal hench- \nman, he has only himself to blame. \nOn the other hand, not all henchmen are \nparagons of loyalty. The player character \nmust always be aware that henchmen are \nsometimes not what they seem. They can bc"
