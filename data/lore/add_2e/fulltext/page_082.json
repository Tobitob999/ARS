With them are all his \ninstructions for memorizing and casting all \nthe spells he knows. As the wizard success- \nfully learns a new spell, he carefully enters \nits formula into his spell books. A wizard \ncan never have a spell in his books that he \ndoes not know, because if he doesn't under- \nstand it, he cannot write the formula. Like- \nwise, he cannot enter a spell into his books \nthat is higher in level than he can cast. If he \nfinds an anaent tome with spells of higher \npower, he must simply wait until he \nadvances to a level at which he can use \nthem. \nThe exact shape and size of a character's \nspell books is a detail your DM will provide. \nThey may be thick tomes of carefullyinked \nparchment, crackling scrolls in bulky cases, \nor even weighty clay tablets. They are \nalmost never convenient to carry around. \nTheir exact form depends on the type and \nsetting of the campaign world your DM has \ncreated. \nUltimately, it is the memorization that is \nimportant. To draw on magical energy, the \nwizard must shape specific mental patterns \nin his mind. He uses his spell books to force \nhis mind through mental exerdses, prepar- \ning it to hold the final, twisted patterns. \nThese pattems are very complicated and \nalien to normal thought, so they don't regis- \nter in the mind as normal learning. To shape \nthese patterns, the wizard must spend time \nmemorizing the spell, twisting his thoughts \nand recasting the energy patterns each time \nto account for subtle changes-planetary \nmotions, seasons, time of day, and more. \nOnce a wizard memorizes a spell, it \nremains in his memory (as potential energy) \nuntil he uses the prescribed-components to \ntrigger the release of the energy patterns. \nThe mental patterns apparently release the \nenergy while the components shape and \nguide it. Upon casting, the energy of the \nspell is spent, wiped dean from the wizards \nmind. The mental patterns are lost until the \nwizard studies and memorizes that spell \nasain. \nThe number of spells a wizard can memo- \nrize is given by his level (see Table 21); he \ncan memorize the same spell more than \nonce, but each memorization counts as one \nspell toward his daily memorization limit. \nPart of a wizards intelligence can be seen in \nthe careful seieetion of spells he has memo- \nrized. \nMemorization is not a thing that happens \nimmediately. The wizard must have a clear \nhead gairmgd from a restful night's sleep and \nthen has to spend time studying his spell \nbooks. The mwunt of study time needed is \n10 minutes pr bel of the spell being mem- \norized. Thus, a 9th-level spell (the most \npowerful) would require 90 minutes of care- \nful study. Clearly, high-level spelkasters do \nnot lightly change their memorized spells. \nSpells remain memorized until they are \ncast or wiped from the character's mind by a \nspell or magical item. A wizard cannot \nchoose to forget a memorized spell to \nreplace it with another one. He can, how- \never, cast a spell just to cleanse his mind for \nanother spell. (The DM must make sure that \nthe wizard does not get experience for this.) \nSchools of Magic \nAlthough all wiz- \nard spells are learned and memorized the \nsame way, they fall into nine different \nschools of magic. A school of magic is a \ngroup of related spells. \nAbjuration spells are a group of special- \nized protective spells. Each is used to pre- \nvent or banish some magical or nonmagical \neffect or creature. They are often used to \nprovide safety in times of great danger or \nwhen attempting some other particularly \nAlteration spells cause a change in the \nproperties of some already existing thing, \ncreature, or condition. This is accomplished \nby magical energy channeled through the \nwizard. \nConjurution/summoning spells bring \nsomething to the caster from elsewhere. \nConjuration normally produces matter or \nitems from some other place. Summoning \nenables the caster to compel living creatures \nand powers to appear in his presence or to \nchannel extraplanar energies through him- \nself. \nfnchantment/chnrm spells cause a \nchange in the quality of an item or the atti- \ntude of a person or creature. Enchantments \ncan bestow magical properties on ordinary \nitems, while charms can unduly influence \nthe behavior of beings. \nGreater divinations are more powerful \nthan lesser divinations (see below). These \nspells enable the wizard to learn secrets long \nforgotten, to predict the future, and to \nuncover things hidden or cloaked by speIls. \nZflusions deal with spells to deceive the \nsenses or minds of others. Spells that cause \npeople to see things that are not there, hear \nnoises not made, or remember things that \nnever happened are aI1 illusions. \nZnuocation/Eaocation spelis channel \nmagical energy to create specific effects and \nmaterials. Invocation normally relies on the \nintervention of some higher agency (to \nwhom the spell is addressed), wNe evoca- \ntion enables the caster to directly shape the \nenergy. \nLesser diuinution spells are learnable by \nall wizards, regardless of their affiliation. \nThis school includes the most basic and vital \nspelh of the wizard-those he needs to prac- \n81 \ndangerous spell. \ntice other aspects of his craft. Lesser divina- \ntions include mad magic and detect magic. \nNecromancy is one of the most restrictive \nof all spell schools. It deals with dead things \nor the restoration of life, limbs, or vitality to \nliving creatures. Although a small school, \nits spells tend to be powerful. Given the \nrisks of the adventuring world, necromantic \nspells are considered quite useful. \nLearning Spells \nWhether a charac- \nter chooses to be a mage or a specialist in \none of the schools of magic, he must learn \nhis spells from somewhere. While it might \nbe possible for the exceptional wizard to \nlearn the secrets of arcane lore entirely on \nhis own, it isn't very likely. It is fat more \nlikely that your character was apprenticed \nto another wizard as a lad. This kindly \n(severe), loving (callous), understanding \n(ill-tempered), generous (mean-spirited), \nand upright (untrustworthy) master taught \nyour character everything he knows at the \nstart of the game. Then, when it was time, \nthe master sent him into the world (threw \nhim out) with a smile and a pat on the back \n(snarling with his foot on your character's \nbehind). \nOr perhaps your character studied at a \nproper academy for wizards (if your DM \nhas such things). There he completed his les- \nsons under the eye of a firm (mean) but \npatient (irritable) tutor who was ready with \npraise for good work (a cane for the slightest \nfault). But alas, your character's parents \nwere impoverished and his studies had to \nend (fed up with this treatment, your youth- \nful character fled during the night). \nAs you can see, there are a number of \nways your character might have led his \nspells. \nThe one good thing that mmes from your \ncharacter's studies is his initial spell baok. Et \nmay have been a gift from his school or he \nmay have stolen it from his hated master. \nWhatever the case, your character be@ns \nplay with a spell book containing up to a \nfew 1st-level spells. Your DM wiIl tell you \nthe exact number of spells and which spelts \nthey are. As your character adventures, he \nwill have the opportunity to add more spe& \nto his collection. \nWhen your character attains a new level, \nhe may or may not receive new spells. TMs \nis up to your DM. He may allow your char- \nacter to return to his mentor (ppvided he \ndeparted on good termsf) and add a few \nspells to his book. It may be possible for \nyour character to copy spells from the spell \nbook of another player character (with his \npennimion, of course). Or he may have to \nwait until he can find a spell book with new \nspells. How he gets his spells is one of the \nthings your DM decides. \nIn all cases, before he can add a new spell"
