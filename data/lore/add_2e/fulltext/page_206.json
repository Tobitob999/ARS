    "text": "attuned when cast (the method usually \ninvolves a keyword). \nTo place this spell, the caster must trace \nthe outline of the closure with a stick of \ncharcoal and touch the center of the effect. \nAttunement to another individual requires a \nhair or similar object from the individual. \nThe material components are holly ber- \nries. \nFlame Blade (Evocation) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 3’ long, sword-like blade \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the caster causes a blazing \nray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his \nhand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it \nwere a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits \nwith the flame blade in melee combat, the \ncreature struck suffers ld4 + 4 points of \ndamage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e., \n7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is \nespecially vulnerable to fire. If the creature \nis protected from fire, the damage inflicted \nis reduced by 2 (i.e., ld4 + 2 points). Fire \ndwellers and those using fire as an innate \nattack form suffer no damage from the \nspell. The flame blade can ignite combusti- \nble materials such as parchment, straw, dry \nsticks, cloth, etc. However, it is not a magi- \ncal weapon in the normal sense of the term, \nso creatures (other than undead) struck only \nby magical weapons are not harmed by it. \nThis spell does not function underwater. \nIn addition to the caster’s holy symbol, \nthe spell requires a leaf of sumac as a materi- \nal component. \nGoodberry (Alteration, Evocation) \nReversible \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day + 1 dayllevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 2d4 fresh berries \n’ Saving Throw: None \nCasting a goodberry spell upon a handful \nof freshly picked berries makes 2d4 of them \nmagical. The caster (as well as any other \ncaster of the same faith and 3rd or higher \nlevel) can immediately discern which berries \nare affected. A detect magic spell discovers \nthis also. Berries with the magic either \nenable a hungry creature of approximately \nman-size to eat one and be as well- \nnourished as if a full normal meal were eat- \nen, or else cure 1 point of physical damage \nfrom wounds or other similar causes, sub- \n, ,.“’$$. \nject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing \nThe reverse of the spell, budberry, causes \n2d4 rotten berries to appear wholesome, but \neach actually delivers 1 point of poison \ndamage (no saving throw) if ingested. \nThe material component of the spell is the \ncaster’s holy symbol passed over the freshly \npicked, edible berries to be enspelled (blue- \nberries, blackberries, raspberries, currants, \ngooseberries, etc.). \nin any 24-hour period. \nHeat Metal (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 40 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 7 rounds \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of the heat metal spell, the cast- \ner is able to make ferrous metal (iron, iron \nalloys, steel) extremely hot. Elven chain \nmail is not affected, and magical metal \narmor receives an item saving throw vs. \nmagical fire. If this is successful, the heat \nmetal spell does not affect it. \nOn the first round of the spell, the metal \nmerely becomes very warm and uncomfor- \ntable to touch (this is also the effect on the \nlast melee round of the spell’s duration). \nDuring the second and sixth (next to the \nlast) rounds, heat causes blisters and dam- \nage; in the third, fourth, ad fifth rounds, \nthe metal becomes searing hot, causing \ndamage to exposed flesh, as shown below: \nMetal Temperature Damage per Round \nvery warm none \nhot ld4 points \nsearing* 2d4 points \n(*) On the final round of searing, the \nafflicted creature must roll a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell or suffer one of the fol- \nlowing disabilities: hand or foot-unusable \nfor 2d4 days, body-disabled ld4 days, \nhead-unconscious ld4 turns. This effect \ncan be completely removed by the 5th-level \npriest heal spell or by normal rest. \nNote also that materials such as wood, \nleather, or flammable cloth smolder and \nbum if exposed to searing hot metal. Such \nmaterials cause searing damage to exposed \nflesh on the next round. Fire resistance \n(spell, potion, or ring) or a protection from \nfire spell totally negates the effects of a heat \nmetal spell, as does immersion in water or \nsnow, or exposure to a cold or ice storm \nspell. This version of the spell does not func- \ntion underwater. For every two experience \nlevels of the caster, the metal of one man- \nsized creature can be affected (i.e., arms and \n205 \narmor, or a single mass of metal equal to 50 \npounds weight). Thus, a 3rd-level caster \nwould affect one such creature, a 4th- or \n5th-level caster two, etc. \nThe reverse of the spell, chill metal, \ncounters a heat metal spell or else causes \nmetal to act as follows: \nMetal Temperature Damage per Round \ncold none \nicy 1-2 hit points \nfreezing* ld4 hit points \n(*) On the final round of freezing, the \nafflicted creature must roll a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell or suffer from the numb- \ning effects of the cold. This causes the loss of \nall feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM \nrules the saving throw was failed badly) for \nld4 days. During this time, the character’s \ngrip is extremely weak and he cannot use \nthat hand for fighting or any other activity \nrequiring a firm grasp. \nThe chill metal spell is countered by a \nresist cold spell, or by any great heat- \nproximity to a blazing fire (not a mere \ntorch), a magical fluming sword, a wall of \nfire spell, etc. Underwater, this version of \nthe spell inflicts no damage, but ice immedi- \nately forms around the affected metal, \nexerting an upward buoyancy. \nHold Person (EnchantmentKharm) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents, V, S, M \nDuration: 2 roundsllevel \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: ld4 persons \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell holds ld4 humans, denunu- \nmans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immo- \nbile and in place for five or more rounds. \nThe hold person spell affects any bipedal \nhuman, demihuman, or humanoid of man- \nsize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, \ndwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, \nhalf-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, \nhumans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, \npixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. I \nThus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, \nwhile an ogre could not. \nThe effect is centered on a point selected \nby the caster, and it affects persons selected \nby the caster within the area of effect. If the \nspell is cast at three persons, each gets a nor- \nmal saving throw; if only two persons are \nbeing enspelled, each rolls his saving throw \nwith a - 1 penalty; if the spell is cast at but \none person, the saving throw die roll suffers \n-2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for \nWisdom. Those who succeed on their sav- \ning throws are totally unaffected by the \nspell. Undead creatures cannot be held. \nin a 20-foot cube \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI"
