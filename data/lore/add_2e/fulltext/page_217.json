Only animals within \nrange of the caster at the time the spell is cast \nwill come. The caster can try three times to \nsummon three different types of animals- \ne.g., suppose that wild dogs are first sum- \nmoned to no avail, then hawks are \nunsuccessfully called, and finally the caster \ncalls for wild horses that may or may not be \nwithin summoning range. Your DM must \ndetermine the chance of a summoned ani- \nmal type being within the range of the spell. \nThe animals summoned aid the caster by \nwhatever means they possess, staying until \na fight is over, a specific mission is finished, \nthe caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. \nOnly normal or giant animals can be sum- \nmoned; fantastic animals or monsters can- \nnot be summoned by this spell (no \nchimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, \netc.). \nCall Woodland Beings \n(ConjuraHon/summoning) \nSphere: Summoning \nRange: 100 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nsummom certain woodland creatures to his \nlocation. Naturally, this spell works only \noutdoors, but not necessarily only in wood- \ned areas. The caster begins the incantation \nand continues uninterrupted until some \ncalled creature appears or two turns have \nelapsed. (The verbalization and somatic \ngesturing are easy, so this is not particularly \nexhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type \n\\ \nof the following sorts of beings can be sum- \nmoned by the spell. They come only if they \nare within the range of the call. \nThe caster can call three times, for a dif- \nferent type each time. Once a call is su~cess- \nful, no other type can be called without \nanother casting of the spell. (Your DM will \nconsult his outdoor map or base the proba- \nbility of any such creature being within spell \nrange upon the nature of the area the caster \nis in at the time of spellcasting.) \nThe creature(s) called by the spell are \nentitled to a saving throw vs. spell (with a \n-4 penalty) to avoid the summons. Any \nwoodland beings answering the call are \nfavorably disposed to the spellcaster and \ngive whatever aid they are capable of. How- \never, if the caller or members of the caller‘s \nparty are of evil alignment, the creatures are \nentitled to another saving throw vs. spell \n(this time with a +4 bonus) when they come \nwithin 10 yards of the caster or another evil \ncharacter with him. These beings immedi- \nately seek to escape if their saving throws \nare successful. In any event, if the caster \nrequests that the summoned creatures \nengage in combat on his behalf, they are \nrequired to roll a loyalty reaction check \nbased on the caster’s Charisma and what- \never dealings he has had with them. \nThis spell works with respect to neutral or \ngood woodland creatures, as determined by \nthe DM. Thus the DM can freely add to or \nalter the list as he sees fit. \nIf the caster personally knows a certain \nindividual woodland being, that being can \nbe summoned at double the normal range. If \nthis is done, then no other woodland crea- \ntures are affected. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pine cone and eight holly berries. \nIf a percentage chance is given, druids \nand other nature-based priests add 1% per \ncaster level. These chances can be used if no \nother campaign information on the area is \navailable. \nCreature Type of Woodlands \nType Called Light Modera te6ylvan DenseNirgin \n2d8 brownies 30% 20% 10 % \nld4 centaurs 5% 30% 5% \nld4 dtvads 1% 25% 15% \n1 unicorn 15 % 20% \n6 \nCloak of Bravery \nReversible \n(cOl&jtU&~dU~~ \nSphere: Charm \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe cloak of bravery spell can be cast \nupon any willing creature. The protected \nindividual gains a bonus to his saving throw \nagainst any form of fear encountered (but \nnot awe-an ability of some Lesser ad \nGreater Powers). When cast, the spell an \naffect one to four creatures (caster’s choke). \nIf only one is affected, the saving throw \nbonus is +4. If two are affected, the bonus \nis +3, and so forth, until four creatures are \nprotected by a + 1 bonus. The magic of the \ncloak of bravery spell works only once and \nthen the spell ends, whether or not the am- \nture‘s saving throw is successful. The spdl \nends after eight hours if no saving throw is \nrequired before then. \nThe reverse of this spell, cloak of fear, \nempowers a single creature touched to radi- \nate a personal aura of fear, at will, out to a \nthree-foot radius. All other characters and \ncreatures within this aura must roll success- \nful saving throws vs. spell or run away in \npanic for 2d8 rounds. Affected individuals \nmay or may not drop items, at the DMs \noption. \nThe spell has no effect upon undead of \nany sort. The effect can be used but once, \nand the spell expires after eight hours if not \nbrought down earlier. Members of the recip- \nient’s party are not immune to the effects of \nthe spell. \nThe material component for the cloak of \nbravery spell is the feather of an eagle or \nhawk. The reverse requires the tail feathers \nof a vulture or chicken. \nControl Temperature, 10’ Radius \n(Alteration) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 turns + 1 turn/levei \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the temperature \nsurrounding the caster can be altered by 10 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, either upward or down- \nward, per level of experience of the spell- \ncaster. Thus, a loth-bel caster could raise \nor lower the surrounding temperature from \n1 to 100 degrees. The spell can be wed to \nensure the comfort of the caster and those \nwith him in extreme weather conditions."
