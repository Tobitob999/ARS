    "text": "Priest Spells (5th Level; \nI \nbut not communications of animals or \nmindless creatures. When the spell is cast, \nthe spellcaster selects the language or lan- \nguages to be understood. The spell then em- \npowers the caster with the ability to speak \nand understand the language desired with \nperfect fluency and accent. The spell enables \nthe priest to be understood by all speakers \nof that language within hearing distance, \nusually 60 feet. This spell does not predis- \npose the subject toward the caster in any \nway. The priest can speak one additional \ntongue for every three levels of experience. \nThe reverse of the spell cancels the effect \nof the tongues spell or confuses verbal com- \nmunication of any sort within the area of ef- \nfect. \nUI \nFifth4evel Spells \nAir Walk (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Air) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables a creature, which can \nbe as large as the largest giant, to tread upon \nair just as if it were solid ground. Moving \nupward is similar to walking up a hill; a \nmaximum upward angle of 45 degrees is \npossible at one-half the creature‘s move- \nment rate. Likewise, a maximum downward \nangle of 45 degrees at the normal movement \nrate is possible. An air-walking creature is \nalways in control of its movement rate, save \nwhen a wind is blowing. In this case the \ncreature gains or loses 10 feet of movement \nfor every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. \nThe creature may, at the DMs option, be \nsubject to additional penalties, loss of con- \ntrol, and possible damage in exceptionally \nstrong or turbulent winds. \nThe spell can be placed upon a trained \nmount, so it can be ridden through the air. \nOf course, a mount not accustomed to such \nmovement would certainly need careful and \nlengthy training, the details of which are up \nto the DM. \nThe material components for the spell are \nthe priest’s holy symbol and a bit of thistle- \ndown. \nAnimal Growth (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Up to 8 animals in a \n20-foot-square area \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the caster causes \nall animals, up to a maximum of eight, \nwithin a 20-foot-square area to grow to \ntwice their normal size. The effects of this \ngrowth are doubled Hit Dice (with resultant \nimprovement in attack potential), doubled \nhit points (except hit points added to Hit \nDice), and doubled damage in combat. \nMovement and AC are not affected. The \nspell lasts for two rounds for each level of \nthe caster. The spell is particularly useful in \nconjunction with a charm person or mam- \nmal spell. \nThe reverse reduces animal size by one- \nhalf, and likewise reduces Hit Dice, hit \npoints, attack damage, etc. \nThe material component for this spell and \nits reverse is the caster’s holy symbol and a \nscrap of food. \nAnimal Summoning 11 \n(ConjuratiodSummoning) \nSphere: Animal, Summoning \nRange: 60 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster calls up \nto six animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less, or \n12 animals of 4 Hit Dice or less, of whatever \nsort the caster names. Only animals within \nrange of the caster at the time the spell is cast \nwill come. The caster can try three times to \nsummon three different types of animals- \nsuppose that wild dogs are first summoned \nto no avail, then hawks are unsuccessfully \ncalled, and finally the caster calls for wild \nhorses that may or may not be within sum- \nmoning range. Your DM will determine the \nchance of a summoned animal type being \nwithin range of the spell. The animals sum- \nmoned aid the caster by whatever means \nthey possess, staying until a fight is over, a \nspecific mission is finished, the caster is safe, \nhe sends them away, etc. Only normal or gi- \nant animals can be summoned; fantastic an- \nimals or monsters cannot be summoned by \nthis spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, \nmanticores, etc.). \nAnti-Plant Shell (Abjuration) \nSphere: Plant, Protection \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: 15’ diameter hemisphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThe anti-plant shell spell creates an invisi- \nble, mobile barrier that keeps out all crea- \ntures or missiles of living vegetable \nmaterial. Thus, the caster (and any crea- \ntures within the shell) is protected from at- \ntackingplants or vegetable creatures such as \nshambling mounds or treants. Any attempt \nto force the barrier against such creatures \nshatters the barrier immediately. The spell \nlasts for one turn for each experiencelevel of \nthe caster. \nAtonement (Abjuration) \nSphere: All \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 person \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is used by the priest to remove \nthe burden of unwilling or unknown deeds \nfrom the person who is the subject of the \natonement. The spell removes the effects of \nmagical alignment change as well. The per- \nson seeking the atonement spell must either \nbe truly repentant or not have been in com- \nmand of his own will when the acts to be \natoned for were committed. Your DM will \njudge this spell in this regard, noting any \npast instances of its use upon the person. \nDeliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing \nand willful nature cannot be atoned for with \nthis spell (see the quest spell). A character \nwho refuses to accept an atonement is auto- \nmatically considered to have committed a \nwillful misdeed. \n22 1"
