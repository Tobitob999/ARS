Various cure spells will not \nremove this effect, and only a dispel magic \nor the spellcaster can do away with the \nblindness if the creature fails its initial sav- \ning throw vs. spell. A blinded creature suf- \nfers a -4 penalty to its attack rolls, and its \nopponents gain a +4 bonus to their attack \nrolls. \nBlur (IIIusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 rounaiievei \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a blur spell is cast, the wizard \ncauses the outline of his form to become \nblurred, shifting and wavering. This distor- \ntion causes all missile and melee combat \nattacks against the caster to be made with \n-4 penalties on the first attempt and -2 \npenalties on all successive attacks. It also \ngrants the wizard a + 1 bonus to his saving \nthrow for any direct magical attack. A \ndetect invisibility spell will not counter this \neffect, but the 5th-level clerical spell true \nseeing and similar magic will. \nContinual Ught (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to a light spell, except \nthat it is as bright as full daylight and lasts \nuntil negated by magical darkness or by a \ndispel magic spell. Creatures who suffer \npenalties in bright light suffer them in this \nspell's area of effect. As with the light spell, \nit can be cast into the air, onto an object, or \nat a creature. In the third case, the spell af- \nfects the space about one foot behind a crea- \nture that successfully rolls its saving throw \nvs. spell. Note that this spell can also blind a \ncreature if it is successfully cast upon the \nthe creature's attack rolls, saving throws, \nand Armor Class by 4. If the spell is cast on \na small object that is then placed in a light- \nproof covering, the spell's effects are \nblocked until the covering is removed. \nA continual light brought into an area of \nmagical darkness (or vice versa) is tempo- \nrarily negated so that the otherwise prevail- \ning light conditions exist in the overlapping \nareas of effect. A direct casting of continual \nlight against a similar or weaker magical \ndarkness cancels both. \nThis spell eventually consumes the mate- \nrial it is cast upon, but the process takes far \nlonger than the time in the typical cam- \npaign. Extremely hard and expensive mate- \nrials can last hundreds or even thousands of \nyears. \nDarkness, 15' Radius (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: '15-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes total, impenetrable \ndarkness in the area of effect. Infravision is \nuseless. Neither normal nor magical lat \nworks unless a light or continual light spell \nis used. In the former event, the darkness \nspell is negated by the light spell and vice \nversa. \nThe material components of this spell are \na bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch or a \npiece of coal. \nDeafness (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe deafness spell causes the recipient to \nbecome totally deaf and unable to hear any \nsounds. The victim is allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell. An affected creature has a \n-1 penalty to its surprise rolls unless its \nother senses are unusually keen. Deafened \nspellcasters have a 20% chance to miscast \nany spell with a verbal component. This \ndeafness can be done away with only by \nmeans of a dispel magic spell or by the spell- \ncaster. \nThe material component of this spell is \nbeeswax. \nDeeppockets (Alteration, Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 12 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 garment \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to specially \nprepare a garment so as to hold far more \nthan it normally could. A finely sewn gown \nor robe of highquality material (at least 50 \ngp value) is fashioned so as to contain \nnumerous hand-sized pockets. One dozen is \nthe minimum number. The deeppockets \nspell then enables these pockets to hold a \ntotal of 100 pounds (five cubic feet in vol- \nume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. \nFurthermore, there are no discernible bulges \nwhere the special pockets are. At the time of \ncasting, the caster can instead chose to have \n10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 \ncubic foot volume each). If the robe or like \ngarment is sewn with 100 or more pockets \n(200 gp minimum cost), 100 pockets can be \ncreated to contain one pound of weight and \n'/6 cubic foot volume each. Each special \npocket is actually an extradimensional hold- \ning space. \nIf the spell duration expires while there is \nmaterial within the enchanted pockets, or if \na successful dispel magic is cast upon the \nenchanted garment, all the material sudden- \nly appears around the wearer and immedi- \nately falls to the ground. The caster can also \ncause all the pockets to empty with a single \ncommand. \nIn addition to the garment, which is reus- \nable, the material components of this spell \nare a tiny golden needle and a strip of fine \ncloth given a half-twist and fastened at the \nends. \nDetect Evil (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot path \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell discovers emanations of evil (or \nof good in the case of the reverse spell) from \nany creature, object, or area. Character \nalignment is not revealed under most cir- \ncumstances: characters who are strongly \naligned, do not stray from their faith, and \nwho are at least 9th level might radiate good \nor evil if they are intent upon appropriate \nactions. Powerful monsters, such as ki-rin, \nsend forth emanations of evil or good, even \nif polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate \nevil, for it is this power and negative force \nthat enable them to continue existing. An \ni"
