    "text": "Wizard Spells (5th Level, \nfeet. In addition, the wall inflicts 2d6 points \nof damage, plus 1 point of damage per level \nof the spellcaster, upon any creature passing \nthrough it. Creatures especially subject to \nfire may take additional damage, and \nundead always take twice normal damage. \nNote that attempting to catch a moving \ncreature with a newly-created wall of fire is \ndifficult; a successful saving throw enables \nthe creature to avoid the wall, while its rate \nand direction of movement determine \nwhich side of the created wall it is on. The \nwall of fire lasts as long as the wizard con- \ncentrates on maintaining it, or one round \nper level of experience of the wizard, in the \nevent he does not wish to concentrate upon \nit. \nThe material component of the spell is \nphosphorus. \nWall of Ice (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast in one of three \nways: as an anchored plane of ice, as a \nhemisphere, or as a horizontal sheet to fall \nupon creatures with the effect of an ice \nstorm. \nA) Ice plane. When this spell is cast, a \nsheet of strong, hard ice is created. The wall \nis primarily defensive, stopping pursuers \nand the like. The wall is one inch thick per \nlevel of experience of the wizard. It covers a \n10-foot-square area per level (a loth-level \nwizard can create a wall of ice up to 100 feet \nlong and 10 feet high or 50 feet long and 20 \nfeet high, etc.). Any creature breaking \nthrough the ice suffers 2 points of damage \nper inch of thickness of the wall. Fire-using \ncreatures suffer 3 points of damage per inch, \nwhile cold-using creatures suffer only 1 \npoint of damage per inch when breaking \nthrough. The plane can be oriented in any \nfashion as long as it is anchored aIong one or \nmore sides. \nB) Hemisphere. This casting of the spell \ncreates a hemisphere whose maximum radi- \nus is equal to three feet plus one foot per \ncaster level. Thus a 7th-level caster can cre- \nate a hemisphere 10 feet in radius. The hemi- \nsphere lasts until it is broken, dispelled, or \nmelted. Note that it is possible, but difficult, \nto trap mobile opponents under the hemi- \nsphere. \nC) Ice sheet. This casting of the spell \ncauses a horizontal sheet to fall upon oppo- \nnents. The sheet covers a Wfoot-square \narea per caster level. The sheet has the same \neffect as an jce storm's hail stones--3dlO \n% \nA wall of ice cannot form in an ivea occu- \npied by physical objects or creatures; its sur- \nface must be smooth and unbroken when \ncreated. Magical fires such as fireballs and \nfiery dragon breath melt a wall of ice in one \nround, though this creates a great cloud of \nsteamy fog that lasts one turn. Normal fires \nor lesser magical ones do not hasten the \nmelting of a wall of ice. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall piece of quartz or similar rock crystal. \nWizard Eye (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is employed, the wizard \ncreates an invisible sensory organ that sends \nhim visual information. The wizard eye \ntravels at 30 feet per round if viewing an \narea ahead as a human would (i.e., primari- \nly looking at the floor), or 10 feet per round \nif examining the ceiling and walls as well as \nthe floor ahead. The wizard eye can see with \ninfravision up to 10 feet, and with normal \nvision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit \nareas. The wizard eye can travel in any \ndirection as as long as the spell lasts. It has \nsubstance and a form that can be detected \n(by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). \nSolid barriers prevent the passage of a wiz- \nard eye, although it can pass through a \n!pace no smaller than a small mouse hole \n[one inch in diameter). \nUsing the eye requires the wizard to con- \n:entrate. However, if his concentration is \nwoken the spell does not end-the eye \nnerely becomes inert until the wizard again \n:oncentrates, subject to the duration of the \nipell. The powers of the eye cannot be \n?nhanced by other spells or items. The cast- \n!r is subject to any gaze attack met by the \n:ye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard \nor eye ends the spell. With respect to blind- \nness, magical darkness, and so on, the wiz- \nard eye is considered an independent sen- \nsory organ of the caster. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of bat fur. \nof damage inflicted to creatures \nc \nFitth-Level Spells \nAdvanced Illusion (Musion/Ph.ntarm) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: One afoot cube + \na IO-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is essentially a spectral forces \nspell that operates through a program (simi- \nlar to a programmed illusion spell) deter- \nmined by the caster. It is thus unnecessary \nfor the wiwd to concentrate on the spell for \nlonger than the round of casting it, as the \nprogram has then started and will continue \nwithout supervision. The illusion has vis- \nual, audio, olfactory, and thermal compo- \nnents. If any viewer actively attempts to \ndisbelieve the spell, he gains a saving throw"
