    "text": "I \nOpen Doors indicates the character’s \nchance to force open a heavy or stuck door. \nWhen a character tries to force a door open, \nroll ld20. If the result is equal to or less than \nthe listed number, the door opens. A charac- \nter can keep trying to open a door until it \nfinally opens, but each attempt takes time \n(exactly how much is up to the DM) and \nmakes a lot of noise. \nNumbers in parentheses are the chances \n(on ld20) to open a locked, barred, or magi- \ncally held door, but only one attempt per \ndoor can ever be made. If it fails, no further \nattempts by that character can succeed. \nBend Bars/Lift Gates states the character’s \npercentage chance (rolled on percentile dice) \nto bend normal, soft iron bars, lift a vertical \ngate (portcullis), or perform a similar feat of \nenormous strength. When the character \nmakes the attempt, roll percentile dice. If \nthe number rolled is equal to or less than the \nnumber listed on Table 1, the character \nbends the bar or lifts the gate. If the attempt \nfails, the character can never succeed at that \ntask. A character can, however, try to bend \nthe bars on a gate that he couldn’t lift, and \nvice versa. \nTable 1: STRENGTH \nAbility Hit Damage Reignt Max.

Dex- \nterity affects a character’s reaction to a \nthreat or surprise, his accuracy with thrown \nweapons and bows, and his ability to dodge \nan enemy’s blows. It is the prime requisite of \nrogues and affects their professional skills. \nA rogue with a Dexterity score of 16 or high- \ner gains a 10 percent bonus to the experience \npoints he earns. \nReaction Adjustment modifies the die roll \nto see if a character is surprised when he \nunexpectedly encounters NPCs. The more \npositive the modifier, the less likely the \ncharacter is to be surprised. \nMissile Attack Adjustment is used to \nmodify a character’s die roll whenever he \nuses a missile weapon (a bow or a thrown \nweapon). A positive number makes it easier \nfor the character to hit with a missile, while \na negative number makes it harder. \nDefensive Adjustment applies to a char- \nacter’s saving throws (see Glossary) against \nattacks that can be dodged-lightning bolts, \nboulders, etc. It also modifies the character’s \nArmor Class (see Glossary), representing \nhis ability to dodge normal missiles and par- \nry weapon thrusts. For example, Rath is \nwearing chain mail, giving him an Armor \nClass of 5. If his Dexterity score is 16, his \nArmor Class is modified by -2 to 3, mak- \ning him harder to hit. If his Dexterity score \nis 5, his Armor Class is modified by + 2 to 7, \nmaking him easier to hit. (In some situa- \ntions, beneficial Dexterity modifiers to \nArmor Class do not apply. Usually this \noccurs when a character is attacked from \nbehind or when his movement is \nrestricted-attacked while prone, tied up, \non a ledge, climbing a rope, etc.) \nTable2: DExlwn \nMiuile \nAbility Reaction Attack Defenriro \n4 -2 \n5 -1 \nA& \n+4 \n+3 \n+2 \n9 0 0 \n10-14 0 0 0 \n14 \nConstitution \nA charactds Con- \nsique, fitness, health, and phpaical \nresi&ance to hadship, in-, and discrsc. \nSince this ab&y affects the droractas hit \npoints and ehenccs of surviving such tre- \nmendous shocks as being physicdly \nreshaped by ma& or rrstlmetcd fm \ndeath, it is vitally iqortant to d d9ssts. \nSome classes have minimum allowable \nConstitution scores. \nA character‘s initial ConstiMion score is \nthe absolute limit to the number of times the \nCharacter CilZI be rahd 0s reLurrwxdd fmm \ndeath.
