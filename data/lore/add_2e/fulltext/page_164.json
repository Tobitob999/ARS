    "text": "- \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nr \nClass and attack forms. Those who believe \nin the shadow monsters suffer real damage \nfrom their attacks. Special attack forms \nsuch as petrification or level drain do not \nactually occur, but a subject who believes \nthey are real will react appropriately. \nThose who roll successful saving throws \nsee the shadow monsters as transparent \nimages superimposed on vague shadowy \nforms. These are Annor Class 10 and inflict \nonly 20% of normal melee damage (biting, \nclawing, weapon, etc.), dropping fractional \ndamage less than .4 as done with hit points. \nExample: A shadow monster griffon \nattacks a person who knows it is only quasi- \nreal. The monster strikes with two claw \nattacks and one bite, hitting as a 7-Hit Die \nmonster. All three attacks hit, and the nor- \nmal damage dice are rolled, multiplied by .2 \nseparately, rounded up or down, then added \ntogether to get total damage. Thus if the \nattacks score 4,2, and 11 points, then a total \nof 4 points of damage is inflicted (4 x .2 = \n.8 [rounded to 1],2 X .2 .4 [rounded to \n11.11 x .2 = 2.2 [rounded to 21. The sum is \n1 + 1 + 2 = 4). \nShout (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V,M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot X =foot cone \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a shout spell is cast, the wizard \ngives himself tremendous vocal powers. \nThe caster can emit an ear-splitting noise \nthat has a principal effect in a cone shape \nradiating from his mouth to a point 30 feet \naway. Any creature within this area is deaf- \nened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d6 points \nof damage. A successful saving throw vs. \nspell negates the deafness and reduces the \ndamage by half. Any exposed brittle or \ncrystal substance subject to sonic vibrations \nis shattered by a shout, while those brittle \nobjects in the possession of a creature \nreceive the creature’s saving throw. Deaf- \nened creatures suffer a -1 penalty to sur- \nprise rolls, and those that cast spells with \nverbal components are 20% likely to mis- \ncast them. \nThe shout spell cannot‘penetrate the 2nd- \nlevel clerical spell, silence, 10’ radius. This \nspell can be employed but once per day, for \notherwise the caster might permanently \ndeafen himself. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of honey, a drop of citric acid, and a \nsmall cone made from a bull or ram horn. \nL \nSolid Fog (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 rounaiievei \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 20’ x 10’ x 10‘ volume/ \nlevel of caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \na billowing mass of misty vapors similar to \na wall of fog spell. The caster can create less \nvapor if desired, as long as a rectangular or \ncubic mass at least 10 feet dn a side is \nformed. The fog obscures all sight, normal \nand infravision, beyond two feet. However, \nunlike normal fog, only a very strong wind \ncan move these vapors, and any creature \nattempting to move through the solid fog \nprogresses at a rate of but one foot per \nmovement rate of 1 per round. A gust of \nwind spell cannot affect it. A fireball, flame \nstrike, or a wall of fire can bum it away in a \nsingle round. \nThe material components for the spell are \na pinch of dried, powdered peas combined \nwith powdered animal hoof. \nStoneskin (Alt \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCastinn Time: 1 \nArea 07 Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the affected crea- \nture gains a virtual immunity to any attack \nby cut, blow, projectile, or the like. Even a \nsword of sharpness cannot affect a creature \nprotected by stoneskin, nor can a rock \nhurled by a giant, a snake’s strike, etc. How- \never, magical attacks from such spells as \nfireball, magic missile, lightning bolt, and \nso forth have their normal effects. The spell \nblocks ld4 attacks, plus one attack per two \nlevels of experience the caster has achieved. \nThis limit applies regardless of attack rolls \nand regardless of whether the attack was \nphysical or magical. For example, a \nstoneskin spell cast by a 9th-level wizard \nwould protect against from five to eight \nattacks. An attacking griffon would reduce \nthe protection by three each round; four \nmagic missiles would count as four attacks \nin addition to inflicting their normal dam- \nage. \nThe material components of the spell are \ngranite and diamond dust sprinkled on the \nrecipient’s skin. \n163 \nVacancy (Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radi \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a vacancy spell is cast, th \ncauses an area to appear to be \nneglected, and unused. Those wh \nthe area see dust on the floor, cobwe \nand other conditions typical of a \nabandoned place. If they pass through the \narea of effect, they seem to leave tracks, tear \naway cobwebs, and so on. Unless they actu- \nally contact some object cloaked by the \nspell, the place appears empty. Merely \nbrushing an invisible object does not cause \nthe vacancy spell to be disturbed: Only \nforceful contact grants a chance to note that \nall is not as it seems. \nIf forceful contact with a cloaked obj& \noccurs, those creatures subject to the spell \ncan penetrate the spell only if they discover \nseveral items that they cannot see; each \nbeing is then entitled to a saving throw vs. \nspell. Failure means they believe that the \nobjects are invisible. A dispel magic spell \ncancels this spell so that the true area is seen. \netrate the deception, \nest black silk to cast this spell. This material \ncomponent must be worth at least 100 \nand is used up during spellc \nWall of Fire (Evocation) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe wall of fire spell brings forth an \nimmobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of \n.shimmering color-violet or reddish-blue. \nThe spell creates either an opaque sheet of \nflame up to one 20-foot square per level of \nthe spellcaster, or a ring with a radius af up \nto 10 feet + five feet per two levels of expe- \nrience of the wizard. In either form, the wall \nof fire is 20 feet high. \nThe wall of fire must be cast so that it is \nvertical with respect to the caster. One side \nof the wall, selected by the caster, sends \nforth waves of heat, inflicting 2d4 points of \ndamage upon creatures within 10 feet and \nld4 points of damage upon those within u)"
