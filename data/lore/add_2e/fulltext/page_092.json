Under most circum- \nstances, a natural 20 hits and a natural 1 \nmisses, regardless of any modifiers applied \nto the die roll. \nThus, even if a character’s chance to hit a \nmonster is 23 and the character has a -3 \npenalty applied to the die roll, he might be \nableto score a hit-but only if the die roll is \na 20 before any modifiers are applied. Like- \nwise, a character abk to hit a monster on a 3 \nor better, waving a sword +4, could still \nmiss if a 1 is rolled on the die. \nlad, in \nsitua- \nCalculating THACO \nTo make an attack \nroll, the character‘s THACO must be known. \nThis depends on the group and level, if the \nattacker is a player character or NPC, or the \nHit Dice if the attacker is a monster or an ani- \nmal. All 1st-level characters have THAcas of \n20, regardless of class. \nFor a character of level 1 through level 20, \nconsult Table 53. This table lists the THACO \nnumber of each group through 20th level, so \nplayers don’t have to perform any calcula- \ntions. \nFor a character higher than 20th level, \nfind the Improvement Rate for the charac- \nter’s group in Table 54. There you’ll find the \nnumber of levels a character must advance \nto reduce his THACO by 1 (or more) points. \nCalculate the character’s THACO according \nto his level. \nThe DMG contains the information on \nmonster THACOs. \nI I Table 53: CALCULATED THACOS \nLevel \ncroup 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 I2 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 %O \n20 20 20 18 18 18 16 16 16 14 %. 14 12 12 12 10 10 10 8 8 \n20 20 19 19 18 18 17 17 16 16 15 15 14 14 13 13 12 12 11 11 \n20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 \n20 20 20 19 19 19 18 18 18 17 17 17 16 16 16 15 15 15 14 14 \nTHACO ADVANCEMENT 9 \nImprovement Rate \nPoints/Level \nWarrior \nWIzard \nI \n111 \n113 \n91 \nI4 \nCombat and Encounters \nEncounters are the \nheart of the AD&P game. Since encoun- \nters with monsters and NPCs often lead to \ncombat, an understanding of what happens \nduring battles is vital for everyone. There \nare several factors the DM will consider in \nany combat, most of which arise from the \ncircumstances of the encounter. b anyom \nsurprised? How far apart are &e oppo- \nnents? How many of them an there? \nAnswer6 to these questions are fowd in the \nEncounter section of the DMG. These are \nquestions common to all encounters, \nwhether combat occurs or not. \nThe Combat Round \nIf an encounter es- \ncdates into a combat situation, the time \nscale of the game automatically goes to \nrounds (also called meke rounds or combat \nrounds). Rounds are used to mco~lura the \nactions of characters in combat (or other \nintensive actions in which time is impor- \ntant). \nA round is approximately one minute \nlong. Ten combat rounds equal a turn (or, \nput another way, a turn equals 10 minutes of \ngame time). This is particularly important \nto remember for spells that last for turns, \nrather than rounds. \nBut these are just approximathns- \nprecise time measurements areimpossible to \nmake in combat.
