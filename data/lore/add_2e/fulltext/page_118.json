In the \nAD&W game, characters can see set dis- \ntances and often by fantastic means that \ndefy logic. \nTwilight 500 150 30 10 \nlimits of Vision \n, The first limitation \non vision is how far away an object can be \nbefore it cannot been seen clearly. Size and \nweather have a great effect on this. Moun- \ntains can be seen from great distances, 60 to \n100 miles or more, yet virtually no detail \ncan be seen. On level ground, the horizon is \nabout five to 12 miles away, but a character \nusually cannot see a specific object that far \naway. The limit of vision for seeing and \nidentifying man-sized objects is much less \nthan this. \nUnder optimum conditions, the maxi- \nmum range at which a man-sized object can \nbe seen is about 1,500 yards, if it is moving. \nIf the object doesn't move, it usually cannot \nbe seen at this distance. Even if it is moving, \nall that can be seen is a moving object. The \ncharacter cannot tell what it is or what it is \ndoing. \nAt 1,OOO yards, both moving and station- \nary man-sized objects can be spotted. Gen- \neral size and shape can be determined, but \nexact identifications are impossible. It is not \nlikely that creature type can be identified at \nthis range, unless the creature has a very \nunique shape. \nAt 500 yards, general identifications can \nbe made. Si, shape, color, and creature \ntype are all distinguishable. Individuals still \ncannot be identified, unless they are distinc- \ntively dressed or separated from the rest of \nthe group. Livery and heraldic symbols or \nbanners can seen if large and bold. Most \ncoats of arms cannot be distinguished at this \ndistance. General actions can be ascertained \nwith confidence. \nAt 100 yards, individuals can be identi- \nfied (unless, of course, their features are \nconcealed). Coats of arms are clear. Most \nactions are easily seen, although small \nevents are unclear. \nAt 10 yards, all details but the smabst \nare clear. Emotions and actions are easily \nseen, including such small actions as pick- \npocketing (if it is detectable). \nOf course, conditions are seldom perfect. \nThere are a number of factors that can \nreduce visibility and alter the ranges at \nwhich things can be spotted and identified. \nTable 62 lists the effects of &rent types of \nconditions. \nAll ranges are given in yards. \n\"Movement\" indicates the maximum dis- \ntance at which a moving figure can be seen. \n\"Spotted\" is the maximum distance a mw- \ning or a stationary figure can be seen. \n\"Type\" gives the maximum distance at \nwhich the general details of a figure can be \nseen-species or race, weapons, etc. \"ID\" \nrange enables exact (or reasonably exact) \nidentification. \"Detail\" range means small \nactions can be seen clearly. \nThere are many factors other than weath- \ner that affect viewing. Size is an important \nfactor. When looking at a small creature \n(size S), all categories are reduced to the \nnext lower category (except the \"detail\" \nrange, which remains unchanged). Thus, \nunder clear conditions, the ranges for seeing \na small creature are \"movement\" at 1,0oo \nyards, \"spotted\" at 500 yards, \"type\" at 100 \nyards, and \"ID\" and \"&tail\" at 10 yards. \nWhen sighting large creatures, the \"move- \nment,\" \"spotting,\" and \"type\" ranges are \ndoubled. Exceptionally large creatures can \nbe seen from even greater distances. Large \ngroups of moving creatures can be seen at \ngreat distances. Thus it is easy to see a herd \nof buffalo or an army on the march. \nThe ranges given in Table 62 do not take \nterrain into account. All ranges are based on \nflat, open ground. Hills, mountains, tall \ngrass, and dense woods all drastically \nreduce the chances of seeing a creature. (The \nterrain does not alter sighting ranges, only \nthe chances of seeing a creature.)
