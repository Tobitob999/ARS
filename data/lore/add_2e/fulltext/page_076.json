It is sometimes used as an \ninstrument of execution. \nSword, Bastard This sword is similar to a \nlong sword in size and weight, but has a \nlonger hilt. It can be used one- or two- \nhanded. Use the speed factor and damage \nappropriate to the grip. If it is used two- \nhanded, your character cannot employ a \nshield. \nSword, Khopesh: This is an Egyptian \nweapon. A khopesh has about six inches of \nhandle and quillons. Its blade is then \nstraight from the quillons for about two \nfeet. The blade becomes sickle-shaped at \nthis point, being about two additional feet \nlong but effectively extending the overall \nlength of the sword by only 1% feet. This \nmakes the khopesh both heavy and \nunwieldy, difficult to employ properly, and \nslow to recover, particularly after a badly \nmissed blow. Its sickle-like portion can snag \nan opponent or an opposing weapon. \nArmor \nYou are going to \nwant your player character to buy armor, if \nhe is allowed to use any. Armor is the easiest \nand cheapest way to improve your charac- \nter’s chance of surviving the more violent \ndangers of the adventuring life. Clearly, the \nbetter the armor the character possesses, the \nless likely he is to be hurt. Armor protection \nis measured by Armor Class (AC), a number \nraw the lower the Armor Class number, \nthe better the protection. Table 46 lists the \nvalues for all the types of armor found in the \ntquipment lists. \nrabk 46: ARMOR CLASS RATINGS \nAC \nNone 10 \nShield only 9 \nLeather or padded armor 8 \nLeather or padded armor + shield, \nstudded leather, or ring mail armor 7 \nStudded leather or ring mail + shield, \nbrigandine, scale mail, \nor hide armor 6 \n5 \nType of Armor \nScale mail or hide + shield, chain mail \nChain mail + shield, splint mail, \nSplint mail, banded mail, or bronze \n. banded mail, bronze plate mail 4 \n3 \nPlate mail + shield, field plate 2 \n1 \nFull plate armor + shield 0 \nNote: See this page for more information \non the defensive benefits of various shields. \nAlthough there is some controversy his- \ntorically over the different types of armor, \nall known or suspected types are included \nhere. However, not all armor may be availa- \nplate mail + shield, plate mail \nField plate armor + shield, full plate \nble if your DM has chosen to set his cam- \npaign in a particular historical era or locale. \nFor example, full plate armor is not availa- \nble to characters adventuring in an ancient \nGreek setting. \nBanded: This armor is made of overlap- \nping strips of metal sewn to a backing of \nleather and chain mail. Generally the strips \ncover only the more vulnerable areas, while \nthe chain and leather protect the joints \nwhere freedom of movement must be \nensured. Through straps and buckles, the \nweight is more or less evenly distributed. \nBdgandine: This armor is made from \nsmall metal plates sewn or riveted to a layer \nof canvas or leather and protected by an \nouter layer of cloth. It is rather stiff and does \nnot provide adequate protection to the \njoints where the metal plates must be spaced \nwidely or left off. \nBronze plate mail: This is a plate mail \narmor-a combination of metal plates, \nchain mail or brigandine, leather and \npadding-made of softer bronze. It is easier \nand cheaper to make than steel armor, but it \ndoes not protect as well. A large breastplate \nand other metal plates cover areas of the \nbody, but the other materials must protect \nthe joints and movable parts of the body. It \nis not the full plate armor of the heavy \nknight of the Late Middle Ages and the Ren- \naissance. \nChain mail: This armor is made of inter- \nlocking metal rings. It is always worn with a \nlayer of quilted fabric padding underneath \nto prevent painful chafing and to cushion \nthe impact of blows. Several layers of mail \nare normally hung over vital areas. The \nlinks yield easily to blows, absorbing some \nof the shock. Most of the weight of this \narmor is camed on the shoulders and it is \nuncomfortable to wear for long periods of \ntime. \nField plate armor: This is the most com- \nmon version of full plate armor, consisting \nof shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and \ninterlocked to cover the entire body. It \nincludes gauntlets, boots, and a visored hel- \nmet. A thick layer of padding must be worn \nunderneath. However, the weight of the suit \nis well-distributed over the whole body. \nSuch Tor hampers movement only slight- \nly. Aside from its expense, the main disad- \nvantages are the lack of ventilation and the \ntime required to put it on and take it off (see \nthe “Getting Into and Out of Armor” sec- \ntion). Each suit of field plate must be indi- \nvidually fitted to its owner by a master \narmorer, although captured pieces can be \nresized to fit the new owner (unless such is \npatently absurd, such as a human trying to \nresize a halfling’s armor). \nFdl Plate This is the impressive, high \nGothic-style armor of the Late Middle Ages \nand Renaissance. It is perfectly forged and \nfitted. All the plates are interlocking and \ncarefully angled to deflect blows. The sur- \n75 \nfaces are normally highly ornamented with \netching and inlaid metals. Each suit must be \ncarefully custom-fitted to the owner and \nthere is only a 20% chance that a captured \nsuit can be refitted to a new owner of \napproximately the same size. The metal \nplates are backed by padding and chain \nmail. The weight is well-dishibuted. The \narmor is hot, slow to don, and extremely \nexpensive. Due to these factors, it tends to \nbe used more for parades and triumphs than \nactual combat. \nHide: This is armor prepd from the \nextremely thick hide of a creature (such as \nan elephant) or from multiple layers of regu- \nlar leather. It is stiff and hard to move in. \nLeather: This armor is made of leather \nhardened in boiling oil and then shaped into \nbreastplate and shoulder protectors. The \nremainder of the suit is fashioned from more \nflexible, somewhat softer materials. \nPadded: This is the simplest type of \narmor, fashioned from quilted layers of \ncloth and batting. It tends to get hot and \nafter a time becomes foul with sweat, grime, \nlice, and fleas. \nPlate mail: This armor is a combination \nof chain or brigandine with metal plates \n(curiass, epaulettes, elbow guards, gaunt- \nlets, tassets, and greaves) covering vital \nareas. The weight is distributed over the \nwhole body and the whole thing is held \ntogether by buckles and straps. This is the \nmost common form of heavy armor. \nRing mail: This armor is an early (and less \neffective) form of chain mail in which metal \nrings are sewn directly to a leather backing \ninstead of being interlaced. (Historians still \ndebate whether this armor ever existed.) \nScale mail: This is a coat and legghgs \n(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather \ncovered with overlapping pieces of metal, \nmuch like the scales of a fish. \nShielda All shields improve a character‘s \nArmor Class by 1 or more against a speci- \nfied number of attacks. A shield is useful \nonly to protect the front and flanks of the \nuser. Attacks from the rear or rear flanks \ncannot be blocked by a shield (exception: a \nshield slung across the back does help \ndefend against rear attacks). The reference \nto the size of the shield is relative to the size \nof the character. Thus a human’s small \nshield would have all the effects of a medi- \num shield when used by a gnome. \nA buckler (or target) is a very small shield \nthat fastens on the forearm. It can be worn \nby crossbowmen and archers with no hin- \ndrance. Its small size enables it to protect \nagainst only one attack per melee round (of \nthe user’s choice), improving the character‘s \nArmor Class by 1 against that attack. \nA small shield is carried on the foream \nand gripped with the hand. Its light weight \npermits the user to carry other items in that \nhand (although he cannot use weapons). It \ncan be used to protect against two frontal"
