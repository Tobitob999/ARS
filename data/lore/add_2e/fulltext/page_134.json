    "text": "4 \nWizard Spells (1 st Level) \nComprehend Languages (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 speaking creature or \nwritten object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard is able \nto understand the spoken words of a crea- \nture or read an otherwise incomprehensible \nwritten message (such as writing in another \nlanguage). In either case, the wizard must \ntouch the creature or the writing. Note that \nthe ability to read does not necessarily \nimpart understanding of the material, nor \ndoes the spell enable the caster to speak or \nwrite an unknown language. Written mate- \nrial can be read at the rate of one page or \nequivalent per round. Magical writing can- \nnot be read, other than to know it is magi- \ncal, but the spell is often useful when \ndeciphering treasure maps. This spell can be \nfoiled by certain warding magics (the 3rd- \nlevel secret page and illusionary script \nspells) and it does not reveal messages con- \ncealed in otherwise normal text. \nThe material components of this spell are \na pinch of soot and a few grains of salt. \nThe reverse of this spell, confuse languag- \nes, cancels a comprehend languages spell or \nrenders a writing or a creature's speech \nincomprehensible, for the same duration as \nabove. \ncing L; : Uteration) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/le \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a dancing lights spell is cast, the \nwizard creates, at his option, from one to \nfour lights that resemble either torches or \nlanterns (and cast that amount of light), \nglowing spheres of light (such as evidenced \nby willswisps), or one faintly glowing, \nvaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar \nto that of a creature from the elemental \nplane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the \nspellcaster desires, forward or back, \nstraight or turning comers, without concen- \ntration upon such movement by the wizard. \nThe spell cannot be used to cause blindness \n(see 1st-level light spell), and it winks out if \nthe range or duration is exceeded. \nThe material component of this spell is \neither a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or \na glowworm. \nDetect Magic (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10' path, 60' long \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the detect magic spell is cast, the \nwizard detects magical radiations in a path \n10 feet wide and up to 60 feet long, in the \ndirection he is facing. The intensity of the \nmagic can be determined (dim, faint, mod- \nerate, strong, overwhelming), and the wiz- \nard has a 10% chance per level to recognize \nif a certain type of magic (alteration, conju- \nration, etc.) is present. The caster can turn, \nscanning a &degree arc per round. A stone \nwall of one foot or more thickness, solid \nmetal of one inch thickness, or a yard or \nmore of solid wood blocks the spell. Magi- \ncal areas, multiple types of magic, or strong \nlocal magical emanations may confuse or \nconceal weaker radiations. Note that this \nspell does not reveal the presence of good or \nevil, or reveal alignment. Other-planar \ncreatures are not neiessarily m 'tal: \nArea of Effect: 60' + 10'/level 1 \nDetect Undead \n(Divination, Necromancy) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 turns \nCasting Time: 1 round \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to detect all \nundead creatures out to the range of the \nspell. The area of effect extends in a path 10 \nfeet wide and 60 feet long (plus 10 feet long- \ner per level of the wizard), in the direction \nthe caster is facing. Scanning a direction \nrequires one round, and the caster must be \nmotionless. While the spell indicates direc- \ntion, it does not give specific location or dis- \ntance. It detects undead through walls and \nobstacles but is blocked by one foot of solid \nstone, one yard of wood or loose earth, or a \nthin coating of metal. The spell does not \nindicate the type of undead detected, only \nthat undead are present. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nbit of earth from a grave. \nI \nMuge (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell causes instant growth of a crea- \nture or object, increasing both size and \nweight. It can be cast only upon a slngle \ncreature (or a symbiotic or community enti- \nty) or upon a single object that does not \nexceed ten cubic feet in volume per caster \nlevel. The object or creature must be seen to \nbe affected. It grows by up to 10% per level \nof experience of the wizard, increasing this \namount in height, width, and weight. \nAll equipment worn or carried by a crea- \nture is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling vic- \ntims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. \nA successful saving throw means the spell \nfails. If insufficient room is available for the \ndesired growth, the creature or object \nattains the maximum possible size, bursting \nweak enclosures in the process, but it is con- \nstrained without harm by stronger \nmaterials-the spell cannot be used to crush \na creature by growth. \nMagical properties are not increased by \nthis spell-a huge sword + 1 is still only + 1, \na staff-sized wand is still only capable of its \nnormal functions, a giant-sized potion \nmerely requires a greater fluid intake to \nmake its magical effects operate, etc. \nWeight, mass, and strength are affected, \nthough. Thus, a table blocking a door \nwould be heavier and more effective, a \nhurled stone would have more mass (and \ncause more damage), chains would be more \nmassive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to \na sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A crea- \nture's hit points, Armor Class, and attack \nrolls do not change, but damage rolls \nincrease proportionately with size. For \nexample, a fighter at 160% normal size hits \nwith his long sword and rolls a 6 for dam- \nage. The adjusted damage roll is 10 (that is, \n6 x 1.6 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to \nStrength; class, and magic are not altered. \nThe reverse spell, reduce, negates the \nenlarge spell or makes creatures or objects \nsmaller. The creature or object loses 10% of \nits original size for every level of the caster, \nto a minimum of 10% of the original size. \nThereafter, the size shrinks by one-foot \nincrements to less than one foot, by one- \ninch increments to one inch, and by ~10- \ninch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an \ninch-the recipient cannot dwindle away to \nnothingness. For example, a 16-foot-tall \ngiant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 \nsteps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine \nsteps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 7.2 inches (in \none step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the \n133"
