However, the \nwall would spring back into existdce as \nsoon as the creature passed through (i.e., no \none else can pass through). \nTurning Undead \nOne important, \nand potentially lifesaving, combat ability \navailable to priests and paladins is the abil- \nity to turn undead. This is a special power \ngranted by the character's deity. Druids cun- \nnot turn undead; priests of specific mythoi \nmay be able to at the DMs option. \nThrough the priest or paladin, the deity \nmanifests a portion of its power, terrifying \nevil, undead creatures or blasting them right \nout of existence. However, since the power \nmwt be channeled through a mortal vessel, \nsuccess is not always assured. \nWhen encountering undead, a priest or \npaladin can attempt to turn the creatures \n(remember that the paladin turns undead as \nif he was two levels lower-a 5th-level pala- \ndin uses the level 3 column in Table 61). \nOnly one attempt can be made per character \nper encounter, but several different charac- \nTo resolve a tuming attempt, look on Ta- \nble 61. Cross-index the Hit Dice or type of \nthe undead with the level of the character \n(two levels lower for a paladin). If there is a \nnumber listed, roll 1&0. If the number \nrolled is equal to or greater than that listed, \nthe attempt is successful. If the letter T \n(for \"turned\") appears, the attempt is auto- \nmatically successful without a die roll. If the \nletter \"D\" (for \"dispel\") is given, the turning \nutterly destroys the undead. A dash (-1 \nmeans that a priest or paladin of that level \ncannot turn that type of undead. A success- \nful turn or dispel affects 2d6 undead. If the \nundead are a mixed group, the lowest Hit \nDice creatures are turned first. \nOnly one die is rolled regardless of the \nnumber of undead the character is attempt- \ning to turn in a given round. The result is \nread individually for each type of undead. \nFor example, Gorus, a 7th-level priest, \nand his party are attacked by two skeletons \nled by a wight and a spectre. The turning at- \ntempt is made, resulting in a roll of 12. \nGorus's player reads the table for all three \ntypes of undead using the same r011-12- \nfor all three. The skeletons are destroyed (as \nGorus knew they would be). The wight is \nTable 61: TURNING UNDEAD \nTvw or Hit Dice Level of Pdestt \noi head 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.1112-13 14+ \nSkeletonorlHD 10 7 4 T T D D D* D* D* D* D* \nZombie 13 10 7 4 T T D D D* D* D* D* \nMummyor7HD - - - 20 19 16 13 1Q 7 4 T T \n*An additional 2d4 Qeatures of this type are turned. \n**Special creatures include unique undead, free-willed undead of the Negative Material \nplane, certain Greater and Lesser Powers, and those undead that dwell in the outer planes. \nt Paladins turn undead as priests who are two levels lower. \nters can make attempts at the same time \n(with the results determined individually). \nAttempting to turn counts as an action, \nrequiring one round and occumng during \nthe character's turn in the initiative order \n(thus the undead may get to act before the \ncharacter can turn them). The mere pres- \nence of the character is not enough-a touch \nof drama from the character is important. \nSpeech and gestures are important, so the \ncharacter must have his hands free and be in \na position to speak.

If unable to escape, they circle at a dis- \ntance, no closer than ten fct to the charac- \nter, provided he continues to maintain his \nturning (no further die rolls are needed). \nIf the character forces the free-willed un- \ndead to come closer than ten feet (bypnessing \nthem into a c-, fa example) the turn- \ning is broken and the dad attack nor- \n&. \nEvil Priests and Undead \nEvil priests are nor- \nmally considered to be in league withundmd \ncreatures, or at least to share their aims and \ngoals.
