Any magical item not related to \nthe fabrication process (such as most pro- \ntective devices) and within 30 feet of the \nmaterials is a source of contaminating magic \nand will spoil the process. \nThe item to be prepared must be touched \nby the spell caster. This touching must be \nconstant and continual during the casting \ntime, which is a base 16 hours plus an addi- \ntional 8d8 hours (as the wizard may never \nwork more than eight hours per day, and \nhaste or any other spells will not alter the \ntime required in any way, this effectively \nmeans that casting time for this spell is two \ndays + ld8 days). All work must be unin- \nterrupted, and during rest periods the item \nbeing enchanted must never be more than \none foot distant from the spellcaster, for if it \nis, the whole spell is spoiled and must be \nbegun again. (Note that during rest periods \nabsolutely no other form of magic can be \nperformed, and the wizard must remain qui- \net and in isolation or the enchantment is \nruined.) \nAt the end of the spell, the caster will \nknow that the item is ready for the final test. \nHe will then pronounce the final magical \nsyllable, and if the item makes a saving \nthrow (which is exactly the same as that of \nthe wizard) vs. spell, the spell is completed. \nThe spellcaster's saving throw bonuses also \napply to the item, up to +3. A result of 1 on \nthe ldzo roll always results in failure, \nregardless of modifications. Once the spell \nis finished, the wizard can begm to place the \ndesired spell upon the item. The spell he \nplans to place must be cast within 24 hours \nor the preparatory spell fades, and the item \nmust be enchanted again. \nEach spell subsequently cast upon ' an \nobject bearing an enchant an item spell \nrequires 2d4 hours per spell level of the mag- \nic being cast. Again, during casting the item \nmust be touched by the wizard, and during \nthe rest periods it must always be within one \nfoot of his person. This procedure holds \ntrue for any additional spells placed upon \nthe item, and each successive spell must be \nbegun within 24 hours of the last, even if the \nprior spell failed. \nNo magic placed on an item is permanent \nunless a permanency spell is used as a finish- \ning touch. This always runs a 5% risk of \ndraining 1 point of Constitution from the \nwizard casting the spell. Also, while it is \npossible to tell when the basic spell (enchunt \nan item) succeeds, it is not possible to tell if \nsuccessive castings actually work, for each \nmust make the same sort of saving throw as \nthe item itself made. Naturally, items that \nare charged-rods, staves, wands, javelins \nof lightning, ring of wishes, etc.-can never \nbe made permanent, Magical devices can- \nnot be used to enchant an item or cast magic \nupon an object so prepared, but scrolls can \nbe used for this purpose. \nThe materials needed for this spell vary \naccording to both the nature of the item \nbeing enchanted and the magic to be cast \nupon it. For example, a cloak of displace- \nment might require the hides of one or more \ndisplacer beasts, a sword meant to slay \ndragons could require the blood and some \nother part of the type(s) of dragon(s) it will \nbe effective against, and a ring of shooting \nstars might require pieces of meteorites and \nthe horn of a ki-rin. These specifics, as well \nas other information pertaining to this spell, \nare decided by your Dungeon Master and \nmust be discovered or researched in \nEnsnarement (Conjuration/Summoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nCasting this spell attempts a dangerous \nact: to lure a powerful creature from \nanother plane to a specially prepared trap, \nwhere it will be held until It agrees to.per- \nform one service in return for freedom from \nthe ensnarement spell. The type of creature \nto be ensnared must be known and stated, \nand if it has a specific, proper, or given \nname, this must be used in casting the \nensnarement spell. The spell causes an \nawareness of a gate-like opening on the \nplane of the creature to be ensnared. A spe- \ncial saving throw is then made to determine \nif the creature detects the nature of the pla- \nnar opening as a trap or believes it to be a \ngate. To save, the creature must roll equal to \nor less than its Intelligence score on ld20. \nThe score is modified by the difference \nbetween the creature's Intelligence and that \nof the spellcaster. If the creature has a lugher \nscore, the difference is subtracted from its \ndice roll to save. If the spellcaster has a high- \ner score, the difference is added to the dice \nroll. \nIf the saving throw succeeds, the creature \nignores the spell-created opening, and the \nspell fails. If the saving throw fails, the crea- \nture steps into the opening and is ensnared. \nWhen so trapped, the other-planar crea- \nture can freely attack the ensnaring wizard, \nunless the caster has created a warding cir- \ncle. Such circles may be temporary (drawn \nby hand) or permanent (inlaid or carved). \nEven with such protection, the entrapped \ncreature may break free and wreak its \nvengeance upon the spellcaster. \nA hand-drawn circle has a base failure \nchance of 20 % , while one inlaid or carved \nhas a base of 10% (and that is for the first \ntime it is used, to determine whether or not \nthe job was done properly). The base \nchance is modified by the difference. \nbetween the wizard's combined Intelligence \nand experience level and the Intelligence and \nthe experience level or Hit Dice of the crea- \nture ensnared. If the spellcaster has a higher \ntotal, that difference in percentage points is \nsubtracted from the chance for the creature \nto break free. If the creature has a higher \ntotal, that difference is added to 2s chance \nto break free. \nThe chance can be further reduced by \ncareful preparation of the circle. If the hand: \nmade circle is drawn over a longer period d \ntime, using specially prepared pigments \n(1,OOO gp value per turn spent drawing), the \nchance of breaking free is reduced by 1 % for \nevery turn spent iq preparation. This can \nbring the base chance to 0%. \nSimilarly, an inlaid or carved design can \na minimum of one full month of time and \nadd not less than 50,OOO gp to the basic cost \nof having the circle inlaid or carved into \nstone. Any break in the circle spoils the effi- \ncacy of the spell and enables the creature to \nbreak free automatically. Even a straw \ndropped across the line of a magic circle \ndestroys its power. Fortunately, the creature \nwithin cannot so much as place a straw \nupon any portion of the inscribed ward, for \nthe magic of the barrier absolutely prevents \nit. \nOnce safely ensnared, the creature can be \nkept for as long as the spellcaster dares. \n(Remember the danger of something break- \ning the ward!) The creature cannot leave the \ncircle, nor can any of its attacks or powers \npenetrate the barrier. The caster can offer \nbribes, use promises, or make threats in \norder to exact one service from the zaptive \ncreature. \nThe DM will then assign a value to what \nthe wizard has said to the ensnared creature, \nrating it from 0 to 6 (with 6 being the most \npersuasive). This rating is then subtracted \nfrom the Intelligence score of the cream. If \nthe creature rolls a successful Intelligence \ncheck against its adjusted Intelligence, it \nrefuses service. New offers, bribes, etc., can \nbe made, or the old ones re-offered 24 hours \nlater, when the creature's Intelligence has \ndropped by 1 point due to confinement. \nThis can be repeated until the creature \npromises to serve, until it breaks free, or \nuntil the caster decides to get rid of it by \nmeans of some riddance spell. Impossible \ndemands or unreasonable commands are \nnever agreed to. \nOnce the single service is completed, the \ncreature need only so inform the spellcaster \nto be instantly sent from whence it came. \nThe creature might later seek revenge. \n176"
