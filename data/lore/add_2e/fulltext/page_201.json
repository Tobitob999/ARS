    "text": "u, \nDetect Snares h Pits (Divination) \not path, 40 feet long \ncasting this spell, the caster is able \nt snares, pits, deadfalls and similar \nalong a 10-foot-wide by 40-foot- \nng path. Such hazards include simple pits, \neadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures \n(e.g., trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant \nlions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed \nof natural materials (mantraps, missile \ntrips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is \ndirectional-the caster must face the desired \ndirection to determine if a pit exists or a trap \nis laid in that direction. The caster experi- \nences a feeling of danger from the direction \nof a detected hazard, which increases as the \nmagic, breath weapons, and so on. The can- \ncellation occurs regardless of the applica- \ntion and regardless of whether a heat or cold \neffect hits the character (e.g., an endure cold \nspell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as \nwell as by magical cold). The recipient of \nthe spell does not suffer the first 10 points of \ndamage (after any applicable saving \nthrows) from the heat or cold during the \nround in which the spell is broken. The spell \nends instantly if either resist fire or resist \ncold is cast upon the recipient. \nEntangle (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 40-fOOt cube \nSaving Throw: V2 \ndanger is approached. The caster learns the \ngeneral nature of the danger (pit, snare, or \ndeadfall) but not its exact operation, nor \nhow to disarm it. Close examination, how- \never, enables the caster to sense what \nintended actions might trigger it. The spell \ndetects certain natural hazards-quicksand \n(snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of \nnatural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such \nas a cavern that floods during rain, an \nunsafe construction, or a naturally poison- \nous plant, are not revealed. The spell does \nnot detect magical traps (save those that \noperate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the \n2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell, \nsnare), nor those that are mechanically \ncomplex, nor does it detect snares or dead- \nfalls that have been rendered safe or inac- \nThe caster must have his holy symbol to \ncomplete the spell. \nEndure Coldhdure Heat (Alteration) \nSphere: Protection \ncreature receiving this spell is pro- \nted from normal extremes of cold or heat \n(depending on which application the priest \nselects at the time of casting). The creature \ncan stand unprotected in temperatures as \nlow as - 30° F. or as high as 130° F. (depend- \ning on application) with no ill effect. Tem- \n- peratures beyond these limits inflict 1 point \nof damage per hour of exposure for every \ndegree beyond the limit. The spell is imme- \nBy means of this spell, the caster is aJ1e to \ncause plants in the area of effect to entangle \ncreatures within the area. The grasses, \nweeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, \nand entwine about the creatures, holding \nthem fast for the duration of the spell. Any \ncreature entering the area is subject to this \neffect. A creature that rolls a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell can escape the area, \nmoving at only 10 feet per round until out of \nthe area. Exceptionally large (gargantuan) \nor strong creatures may suffer little or no \ndistress from this spell, at the DMs option, \nbased on the strength of the entangling \nplants. \nThe material component is the caster's \nholy symbol. \nFaerie Fire (Alteration) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 80 yards \nComponent: V, M \nDuration: 4 roundsAeve1 \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 10 sq. feet/level within \nSaving Throw: None \na 40-foot radius \nThis spell enables the caster to outline one \nor more objects or creatures with a pale \nglowing light. The number of subjects out- \nlined depends upon the number of square \nfeet the caster can affect. Sufficient footage \nenables several objects or creatures to be \noutlined by the faehe fire spell, but one \nmust be fully outlined before the next is \nbegun, and all must be within the area of \neffect. Outlined objects or creatures are visi- \nble at 80 yards in the dark, 40 yards if the \nviewer is near a bright light source. Out- \nlined creatures are easier to strike, thus \nopponents gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls in \ndarkness (including moonlit nights) and a \noutlining can render otherwise invisible \ncreatures visible. However, it cannot out- \nline noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous \ncreatures. Nor does the light come any- \nwhere close to sunlight. Therefore it has no \nspecial effect on undead or darkdwelling \ncreatures. The faerie fire can be blue, green, \nor violet according to the word of the caster \nat the time of casting. The faerie fire does \nnot cause any harm to the object or creature \nthus outlined. \nThe material component is a small piece \nof foxfire. \nInvisibility to Animals (Alteration) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: Touch \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature touched/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an invisibility to animals spell is \ncast, the creature touched becomes totally \nundetectable by normal animals with Intel- \nligences under 6. N.od animals includes \ngiant-sized varieties, but it excludes any \nwith magical abilities or powers. The \nenchanted individual is able to walk among \nsuch animals or pass through them as if he \ndid not exist. For example, this individual \ncould stand before the hungriest of lions or a \ntyrannosaurus rex and not be molested or \neven noticed. However, a nightmare, hell \nhound, or winter wolf would certainly be \naware of the individual. For every level the \ncaster has achieved, one creature can be ren- \ndered invisible. Any recipient attacking \nwhile this spell is in effect ends the spell \nimmediately (for himself only). \nThe material component of this spell is \nholly rubbed over the recipient. \nInvisibility to Undead (Abjuration) \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 6 rounds \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell causes affected undead to lose \ntrack of and ignore the warded creature for the \nduration of the spell. Undead of 4 or fewer Hit \nDice are automatically affected, but those \nwith more Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs. \nspell to avoid the effect. Note that a priest pro- \ntected by this spell cannot turn affected \nundead. The spell ends immediately if the \nrecipient makes any attack, although casting \nspells such as cure light wounds, augury, or \nchant does not end the ward. \nThe material component is the priest's"
