In \nsome cases (especially the paladin), the \nchoice of alignment may be limited. \nThe character’s alignment is a guide to his \nbasic moral and ethical attitudes toward \nothers, society, good, evil, and the forces of \nthe universe in general. Use the chosen \nalignment as a guide to provide a clearer \nidea of how the character will handle moral \ndilemmas. Always consider alignment as a \ntool, not a straitjacket that restricts the \nAttitudes toward \norder and chaos are divided into three \nopposing beliefs. Picture these beliefs as the \npoints of a triangle, all pulling away from \neach other. The three beliefs are law, chaos, \nand neutrality. One of these represents each \ncharacter‘s ethos-his understanding of \nsociety and relationships. \nCharacters who believe in law maintain \nthat order, organization, and society are \nimportant, indeed vital, forces of the uni- \nverse. The relationships between people and \ngovernments exist naturally. Lawful philos- \nophers maintain that this order is not cre- \nated by man but is a natural law of the \nuniverse. Although man does not create \norderly structures, it is his obligation to \nfunction within them, lest the fabric of eve- \nsite, the universe becomes unbalanced. If \nenough of these polarities go out of balance, \nthe fabric of reality could pull itself apart. \nFor example, if death became ascendant \nover life, the universe would become a bar- \nren wasteland. \nPhilosophers of neutrality not only pre- \nsuppose the existence of opposites, but they \nalso theorize that the universe would vanish \nshould one opposite completely destroy the \nother (since nothing can exist without its \nopposite). Fortunately for these philoso- \nphers (and all sentient life), the universe \nseems to be efficient at regulating itself. \nOnly when a powerful, unbalancing force \nappears (which almost never happens) need \nthe defenders of neutrality become seriously \nconcerned. \nThe believers in chaos hold that there is \nno preordained order or careful balance of \nforces in the universe. Instead they see the \nuniverse as a collection of things and events, \nsome related to each other and others com- \npletely independent. They tend to hold that \nindividual actions account for the differ- \nences in things and that events in one area \ndo not alter the fabric of the universe half- \nway across the galaxy. Chaotic philoso- \nphers believe in the power of the individual \nover his own destiny and are fond of anar- \nchistic nations. Being more pragmatic, non- \nphilosophers recognize the function of \nsociety in protecting their individual rights. \nChaotics can be hard to govern as a group, \nsince they place their own needs and desires \nabove those of society. \nGood, Neutrality, and Evil \nLike law and order, \nthe second set of attitudes is also divided \ninto three parts. These parts describe, more \nor less, a character’s moral outlook; they are \nhis internal guideposts to what is right or \nwrong. \nGood characters are just that. They try to \nbe honest, charitable, and forthright. Peo- \nple are not perfect, however, so few are \ngood all the time. There are always occa- \nsional failings and weaknesses. A good per- \nson, however, worries about his errors and \nnormally tries to correct any damage done. \nRemember, however, that goodness has \nno absolute values. Although many things \nare commonly accepted as good (helping \nthose in need, protecting the weak), differ- \nent cultures impose their own interpreta- \ntions on what is good and what is evil. \nThose with a neutral moral stance often \nrefrain from passing judgment on anything. \nThey do not classify people, things, or \nevents as good or evil; what is, is. In some \ncases, this is because the creature lacks the \ncapacity to make a moral judgment (ani- \nmals fall into this category). Few normal \nireatures do anything for good or evil rea- \nsons. They kill because they are hungry or \n46 \nthreatened. They sleep where they find shel- \nter. They do not worry about the moral con- \nsequences of their actions-their actions are \ninstinctive. \nEvil is the antithesis of good and appears \nin many ways, some overt and others quite \nsubtle. Only a few people of evil nature \nactively seek to cause harm or destruction. \nMost simply do not recognize that what \nthey do is destructive or disruptive. People \nand things that obstruct the evil character’s \nplans are mere hindrances that must be \novercome. If someone is harmed in the pro- \ncess ... well, that’s too bad. Remember that \nevil, like good, is interpreted differently in \ndifferent societies. \nAlignment Combinations \nNine different align- \nments result from combining these two sets. \nEach alignment varies from all others, \nsometimes in broad, obvious ways, and \nsometimes in subtle ways. Each alignment is \ndescribed in the following paragraphs. \nLawful Good: Characters of this align- \nment believe that an orderly, strong society \nwith a well-organized government can work \nto make life better for the majority of the \npeople. To ensure the quality of life, laws \nmust be created and obeyed. When peoplc \nrespect the laws and try to help one another, \nsociety as a whole prospers. Therefore, law- \nful good characters strive for those things \nthat will bring the greatest benefit to the \nmost people and cause the least harm. An \nhonest and hard-working serf, a kindly and \nwise king, or a stern but forthright minister \nof justice are all examples of lawful good \npeople. \nLawful Neutral: Order and organization \nare of paramount importance to characters \nof this alignment. They believe in a strong, \nwell-ordered government, whether that \ngovernment is a tyranny or benevolent \ndemocracy. The benefits of organization \nand regimentation outweigh any moral \nquestions raised by their actions. An inquis- \nitor determined to ferret out traitors at any \ncost or a soldier who never questions his \norders are good examples of lawful neutral \nbehavior. \nLawful Evil: These characters believe in \nusing society and its laws to benefit them- \nselves. Structure and organization elevate \nthose who deserve to rule as well as provide \na clearly defined hierarchy between master \nand servant. To this end, lawful evil charac- \nters support laws and societies that protect \ntheir own concerns. If someone is hurt or \nsuffers because of a law that benefits lawful \nevil characters, too bad. Lawful evil charac- \nters obey laws out of fear of punishment. \nBecause they may be forced to honor an \nunfavorable contract or oath they have \nmade, lawful evil characters are usually \nvery careful about giving their word.
