Additional instruments \ncan be learned if the optional proficiency \nrules are used-the bard can learn two in- \nstruments for every proficiency slot spent. \nIn his travels, a bard also manages to \nlearn a few wizard spells. Like a wizard, a \nbards Intelligence determines the number of \nspells he can know and the chance to know \nany given spell. These he keeps in his spell \nbook, abiding by all the restrictions on \nmemorization and spell use that bind a \nmage, especially in the prohibition of ar- \nmor. Hence, a bard will tend to use his spells \nmore to entertain and impress than to fight. \nTable 32 lists the number of spells a bard can \ncast at each level. \nSince bards are dabblers rather than full- \ntime wizards, their spells tend to be gained \nby serendipity and happenstance. In no case \ncan a bard choose to specialize in a school of \nmagic. bing bards do not have a selec- \ntion of spells. A 2nd-level bard begins with \none to four spells, chosen either randomly \nor by the DM. (An Intelligence check must \nstill be made to see if the bard can learn a \ngiven spell.) The bard is not guaranteed to \nknow read magic, as this is not needed to \nread the writings in a spell book. The bard \ncan add new spells to his spell book as he \nfinds. hem, but he does not automatically \ngain additional spells as he advances in \nlevel. All spells beyond those he starts with \nmust be found during the course of adven- \nturing. The bards casting level is equal to \nhis current level. \n%b€e 32: BARD SPELL PROGRESSION \nBard Spell Level \nhi123456 \n1 \n2 I----- \n----_- \n7 321--- \n8 3 3 1--- \n14 33331- \n19 444432 \n20 444443 \nCombat and spells, however, are not the \nmain strength of the bard. Hi3 expertise is in \ndealing and communicating with others. To \nthis end, the bard has a number of special \npowers. The base percentage for eachpower \nis listed on Table 33. This base percentage \nmust be adjusted fbr the race and Dexterity \nof the bard as given in the Thief description. \nAfter all adjustments are made, the player \nmust distribute (however he chooses) 20 ad- \nditional percentage points to the various \nspecial abilities. Thereafter, each time the \ncharacter advances a level, he receives an \nadditional 15 points to distribute. \nTable 33: BARD ABILITIES \nClimb Detect Pick Read \nWalls Noise Pockets Languages \n50% 20% 10% 5% \nBard abilities are subject to modifiers for \nsituation and armor as per the thief (see \npage 39 for a complete explanation). \nClimb Walls enables the bard to climb \nnear sheer surfaces without the aid of tools, \njust like the thief. \nDetect Noise improves the bards chances \nof hearing and interpreting sounds. He may \nbe able to overhear parts of a conversation \non the other side of a door or pick up the \nsound of something stalking the party. To \nuse the ability, the bard must stand un- \nhelmeted and concentrate for one round \n(one minute). During this time, all other \nparty members must remain silent. The DM \nsecretly makes the check and informs the \nplayer of the result. \nPick Pockets enables the bard not only to \nfilch small purses, wallets, keys, and the \nlike, but also to perform small feats of \nsleight-of-hand (useful for entertaining a \ncrowd). Complete details on pickpocketing \n(and your character's chances of getting \ncaught) can be found in the Thief descrip- \ntion. \nRead Languages is an important ability, \nsince words are the meat and drink of bards. \nThey have some ability to read documents \nwritten in languages they do not know, re- \nlying on words and phrases they have \npicked up in their studies and travels. The \nRead Languages column in Table 33 gives \nthe base percentage chance to puzzle out a \nforeign tongue. It also represents the degree \nof comprehension the bard has if he is suc- \ncessful. The DM can rule that a language is \ntoo rare or unfamiliar, especially if it has \nnever been previously encountered by the \nbard, effectively foiling his attempts to \ntranslate it. At the other extreme, the bard \nneed not make the dice roll for any language \nhe is proficient in. Success is assumed to be \nautomatic in such cases. \nThe bard can .bo infIuence reactions of \ngroups of NPCs. When performing before a \ngroup that is not attacking (and not intend- \ning to attack in just Seconds), the bard can \ntry to alter the mood of the listeners. He can \ntry to soften their mood or make it uglier. \nThe method can be whatever is most suit- \nable to the situation at the moment-a fiery \nspeech, collection of jokes, a sad tale, a fine \n42 \ntune played on a fiddle, a haunting lute me]- \nody, or a heroic song from the old home- \nland. Everyone in the group listening mt \nroll a saving throw vs. paralyzation (if the \ncrowd is large, make saving throws for \ngroups of people using average hit dice). \nThe die roll is modified by -1 for every \nthree experience levels of the bard (round \nfractions down). If the saving throw fails, \nthe group's reaction can be shifted one level \n(see the Reactions section in the DMG), to- \nward either the friendly or hostile end of the \nscale, at the player's option. Those who \nmake a successful saving throw have their \nreaction shifted one level toward the oppo- \nsite end of the scale. \nCwell the Fine has been captured by a \ngroup of bandits and hauled into their \ncamp. Although they are not planning to \nkill him on the spot, any fool can plainly see \nthat his future may be depressingly short. In \ndesperation, Cwell begins spinning a comic \ntale about Duke Dunderhead and his blun- \ndering knights. It has always been a hit with \nthe peasants, and he figures it's worth a try \nhere. Most of the bandits hme 1 Hit Die, &ut \nthe few higher level leaders raise theaveruge \nlevel to 3. Cwell is only 2nd level so he gains \nno modifier. A saving throw is rolled and \nthe group fails (Cwell succeeds!). The ruffi- \nans find his tale amusing. The player shiffs \ntheir reaction from hostile to neutral. The \nbandits decide not to kill Cwell but to keep \nhim around, under guard, to entertain \nthem. If the bandits' saving throw had suc- \nceeded, the bandits would have been of- \nfended by the stow (perhaps some of them \nserved under Duke Dunderhaad~), and their \nreaction would have shifted from hostile to \nviolent. They probably would have roasted \nCwell immediately. \nThis ability cannot affect peopk in the \nmidst of battle; it is effective only when the \naudience has time to listen. If Cwell trfed \ntelling his tale while the bandits were attack- \ning his group, the bandits would have \nquickly decided that Cwell was a fool and \ncarried on with their business. Eurthennore, \nthe form of entertainment used must be ap \npropriate to the audience. Cwell mi& be \nable to calm (or enrage) a bear with music, \nbut he won't have much luck telling jokes to \nora unless he speaks their language. \nThe music, poetry, and stonierof the bud \ncan also be inspirational, rallying friends \nand allies. If the exact nature of an impend- \ning threat is known, the bard can heroically \ninspire his companions (immortalizing them \nin word and song), granting a + 1 bonus to \nattack rolls, or a +1 bonus to saving \nthrows, or a +2 bonus to morale (particu- \nlarly useful in large battles) to' those in- \nvolved in melee. The bard must spend at \nleast three full rounds singing or redting be- \nfore the battle begins. This affects those"
