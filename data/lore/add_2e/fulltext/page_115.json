    "text": "Player characters cannot fight, survive, \nwheel, deal, plot, or scheme without inter- \nacting with non-player characters (NPCs). \nIndeed, the very heart of the AD&D@ game \nis the relationship between player charac- \nters and non-player characters. How the \nplayer characters react to and treat NPCs \ndetermines the type of game the group \nplays. Although many choices are possible, \nplayers quickly find that consideration and \ngood treatment of NPCs is the most fre- \nquently successful route. \nAn NPC is any person, creature, or rnon- \nster that is controlled by the DM. Most \nNPCs are either people (intelligent races \nthat live in local society) or monsters (intel- \nligent and unintelligent creatures that aren’t \nnormally found in towns and villages). The \nterm “monster” is only a convenient label. It \ndoesn’t mean the creature is automatically \ndangerous or hostile. Likewise, NPCs who \nare people aren’t uniformly helpful and \ncooperative. As with all things, the range of \npossible reactions of NPCs to PCs covers \nthe entire spectrum. \nIn the course of their adventures, player \ncharacters will be most concerned with \nthree groups of NPCs: hirelings, followers, \nand henchmen. It is their aid that helps play- \ner characters vanquish deadly monsters and \naccomplish mighty deeds. As their names \nimply, these NPCs can be persuaded in vari- \nous ways to join the player characters in \ntheir adventures. The most common meth- \nods of persuasion are money and loyalty. \nHirelings \nThe most frequent- \nly employed NPC is the hireling. A hireling \nis a person who works for money. Most \nhirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while \nothers are masters of a craft or art, and a \nfew are experts of specialized adventuring \nskills. Typical hirelings include the follow- \ning: \nArcher Architect \nArmorer Assassin \nBaker Blacksmith \nBladesmi th Foot Sol& \nJeweler Laborer \nMessenger Minstrel \nSage Sailor \nSPY Thief \nHirelings are always employed for a \nstated term of service or for the perform- \nance of a specific task. Thus a mercenary \ncontracts to serve for a season. A thief can \nbe hired to steal a named item. A sage works \nto answer a single question. A blacksmith \nmay indenture himself for a term of years. A \nsailor works for a single voyage. Quite \noften these contracts can be renewed with- \nout difficulty, but the only thing that binds a \nhireling to the player character is regular \npay and good treatment. Hirelings do not \nserve a PC out of any great loyalty. \nThus there are some things hirelings will \nnot do. Most hirelings do not foolishly risk \ntheir lives. There are soldiers willing to take \ntheir chances on the field of battle, but even \nthese courageous (or foolish) few do not \nwillingly undertake the greater hazards of \nadventuring. They man castle walls, guard \ncaravans, collect taxes, and charge the \nmassed foe well enough, but they often \nrefuse to accompany a PC on an adventure. \nEven a hireling who regularly undertakes \ndangerous missions (a thief or an assassin, \nfor example) normally refuses to join player \ncharacter parties. These hirelings are loners. \nThey contract to do a job and get it done in \ntheir own way, without interference from \nanyone else. \nHirelings are no more loyal than human \nnature &lows. For the most part, if paid and \ntreated well, with opportunities to realize \ntheir ambitions, work for a charismatic \nleader, hirelii can be relied on to do their \n1 \ni \njobs faithfully. But poor pay, injustice, dis- \ncrimination, threats, abuse, and humilia- \ntion at the hands of their masters make them \nsomewhat less than reliable. A smart leader \nsees to the comfort and morale of his men \nbefore his own concerns. With less savory \ncharacters-those hired to perform dark \ndeeds-the player character takes even \ngreater chances, especially given the ques- \ntionable morals of such characters. \nWhatever their personalities, hirelings \ngenerally need to make morale checks \n(explained in the DMG) whenever they are \nfaced with a particularly dangerous situa- \ntion or are offered a bribe or other tempta- \ntion. \nFinding hirelings is not difficult. People \nneed jobs. It is simply a matter of advertis- \ning. Under normal circumstances, appli- \ncants respond to ads. Only when trying to \nemploy vast numbers or hire those with \nunusual specialties (such as spies) does the \nprocess become complicated. Just what"
