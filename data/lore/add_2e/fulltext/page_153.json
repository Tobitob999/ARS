    "text": "Wizard Spells (3rd Level) 1 \nNon-Detection (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or item \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard makes the \ncreature or object touched undetectable by \ndivination spells such as clairuudience, \nclairvoyance, locate object, ESP, and detect \nspells. It also prevents location by such \nmagical items as crystal balls and ESP me- \ndallions. It does not affect the know align- \nment spell or the ability of intelligent or \nhigh-level beings to detect invisible crea- \ntures. If a divination is attempted, the non- \ndetection caster must roll a saving throw vs. \nspell. If this is successful, the divination \nfails. \nThe material component of the spell is a \npinch of diamond dust worth 300 gp. \nPhantom Steed (Conjuration, Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \na quasi-real, horse-like creature. The steed \ncan be ridden only by the wizard who cre- \nated it, or by any person for whom the wiz- \nard specifically creates such a mount. A \nphantom steed has a black head and body, \ngray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, in- \nsubstantial hooves that make no sound. Its \neyes are milky-colored. It does not fight, \nbut all normal animals shun it and only \nmonstrous ones will attack. The mount has \nan Armor Class of 2 and 7 hit points, plus 1 \nper level of the caster. If it loses all of its hit \npoints, the phantom steed disappears. A \nphantom steed moves at a movement rate of \n4 per level of the spellcaster, to a maximum \nmovement rate of 48. It has what seems to \nbe a saddle and a bit and bridle. It can bear \nits rider's weight, plus up to 10 pounds per \ncaster level. \nThese mounts gain certain powers ac- \ncording to the level of the wizard who cre- \nated them: \n8th Level: The ability to pass over sandy, \nmuddy, or even swampy ground without \ndifficulty. \n10th Level: The ability to pass over water \nas if it were firm, dry ground. \n12th Level: The ability to travel in the air \nas if it were firm land, so chasms and the like \ncan be crossed without benefit of a bridge. \nNote, however, that the mount cannot casu- \nally take off and fly; the movement must be \nbetween points of similar altitude. \n14th Level: The ability to perform as if it \nwere a pegasus; it flies at a rate of 48 per \nround upon command. \nNote that a mount's abilities include those \nof lower levels; thus a 12th-level mount has \nthe 8th-, loth-, and 12th-level abilities. \nProtection From Evil, 10' Radius \n(Abjuration) \nReversible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounddevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThe globe of protection of this spell is \nidentical in all respects to a protection from \nevil spell, except that it encompasses a much \nlarger area and its duration is greater. The \neffect is centered on and moves with the \ncreature touched. Any protected creature \nwithin the circle can break the warding \nagainst enchanted or summoned monsters \nby meleeing them. If a creature too large to \nfit into the area of effect is the recipient of \nthe spell, the spell acts as a normal protec- \ntion from evil spell for that creature only. \nTo complete this spell, the caster must \ntrace a circle 20 feet in diameter using pow- \ndered silver. The material component for \nthe reverse is powdered iron. \naround creature touched \nProtection From Normal Misslles \n(Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turnllevel \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard bestows \ntotal invulnerability to hurled and projected \nmissiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, jave- \nlins, small stones, and spears. Furthermore, \nit causes a reduction of 1 from each die of \ndamage (but no die inflicts less than 1 point \nof damage) inflicted by large or magical \nmissiles, such as ballista missiles, catapult \nstones, hurled boulders, and magical ar- \nrows, bolts, javelins, etc. Note, however, \nthat this spell does not convey any protec- \ntion from such magical attacks as fireballs, \nlightning bolts, or magic missiles. \nThe material component of this spell is a \npiece of tortoise or turtle shell. \n152 \nSecret \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Until dispelled \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 page of any size, \nSaving Throw: None \nup to 2 ft. square \nWhen cast, a secret page spell alters the \nactual contents of a page so that they appear \nto be something entirely different. Thus a \nmap can be changed to become a treatise on \nburnishing ebony walking sticks. The text \nof a spell can be altered to show a ledger \npage or even another form of spell. Confuse \nlanguages and explosive runes spells may be \ncast upon the secret page, but a comprehend \nlanguages spell cannot reveal the secret \npage's contents. The caster is able to reveal \nthe original contents by speaking a com- \nmand word, perusing the actual page, and \nthen returning it to its secret page form. The \ncaster can also remove the spell by double \nrepetition of the command word. Others \nnoting the dim magic of a page with this \nspell cloaking its true contents can attempt \nto dispel magic, but if it fails, the page is de- \nstroyed. A true seeing spell does not reveal \nthe contents unless cast in combination with \na comprehend lunguages spell. An eruse \nspell can destroy the writing. \nThe material components are powdered \nherring scales and either will 0' wisp or bog- \ngart essence. \nSepia Snake Sigli \n(ConjuratiodSumrnoning) \nRange: 5 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 sigil \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a small written \nsymbol appears in the text of any written \nwork. When read, the so-called sepia snake \nsprings into being and strikes at the nearest \nliving creature (but does not attack the wiz- \nard who cast the spell). Its attack is made as \nif it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to \nthe level of the wizard who cast the spell. If \nit strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed \nin a shimmering amber field of force, frozen \nand immobilized until released, either at the \ncaster's command, by a successful dispel \nmagic spell, or until a time equal to ld4 days \n+ 1 day per caster level has elapsed. Until \nthen, nothing can get at the victim, move \nthe shimmering force surrounding him, or \notherwise affect him. The victim does not \nage, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells \nwhile in this state. He is not aware of his sur- \nroundings."
