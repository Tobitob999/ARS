This gaze \nattack is in addition to any other attacks \nallowed the wizard. The wizard selects one \nof four possible gaze attacks at the time the \nspell is cast, and this attack cannot be \nchanged. For example, a 12th-level caster \nwho chose fear would have four opportunl- \nties to make gaze attacks causing fear, one \nfor each round of the spell's duration. Any \ngaze attack is negated by a successful saving \nthrow vs. spell, with Wisdom adjustments. \nThe four effects of the spell are as follows: \nCharm: The wizard can charm a single \nperron or monster by gaze and by uttering a \nsingle word. The effect is to make the \nchd subject absolutely loyal and docile \nto the caster, even to the point of personal \ndanger. It is otherwise the same as a charm \nmonster spell. All creatures other than \nhumans, demihumans, and humanoids save \nwith +2 bonuses. \nFear: The wizard can cause fear by gaze \nand by qeahg a single word. The subject \nflees in blind terror for ld4 rounds. After \nthis, the creature refuses to face the caster \nand cowers or bolts for the nearest cover if \nsubsequently confronted by the caster (50% \nchance of either). The latter effect lasts one \nturn per caster level. This attack can be \nnegated by spells that counter fenr. \nSicken: This power enables the caster to \nmerely gaze, speak a word, and cause sud- \nden pain and fever to sweep over the sub- \nject's body. Creatures with ability scores \nfunction at half effectiveness, others inflict \nonly onehalf damage with physical attacks. \nMovement is at one-half normal rate. The \nsubject remains stridcm for one turn per \nlevel of the caster, after which all abilities \nreturn at the rate of one point per turn of \ncomplete rest or one point per hour of mod- \nerate activity. The effects cannot be negated \nby a cure diseuse or heat spell, but a remove \ncurse or successful dispel magic spell is \neffective. Creatures other than hm, \ndemihumans, and humanoids save with +2 \nbonuses versus this attack. \nSleep: The wizard can cause any individ- \nual to fall into a comatose slumber by means \nof a gaze and a single word, unless the sub- \nject successfully rolls its saving throw vs. \nspell. Creatures normally subject to a 1st- \nlevel sleep spell save with -2 penalties. An \naffected creature must be shaken or other- \nwise shocked back to consciousness. \nIn all cases, the gaze attack has a speed \nfactor of 1. This spell does not affect undead \nof any type, or extend beyond the plane \noccupied by the caster. Note that the caster \nis subject to the effects of his reflected gaze, \nand is allowed any applicable saving throw. \nIn the case of a reflected charm gaze, the \ncaster is paralyzed until it wears off or is \ncountered. \nGeao (EnchantmenKham) \nRange: IO yards \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nA gem spell places a magical command \nupon a creature (usually human or human- \noid) to carry out some service, or to refrain \nfrom some action or course of activity, as \ndesired by the spellcaster. The creature must \nbe intelligent, conscious, under its own voli- \ntion, and able to understand the caster. \nWhile a geas cannot compel a creature to \nkill itself or to perform acts that are likely to \nresult in certain death, it can cause almost \nany other course of action. The ged crea- \nture must follow the given instructions until \nthe geas is completed. Failure to do so will \ncause the creature to grow sick and die with- \nin ld4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of \nthe instructions causes corresponding loss \nof Strength points until the deviation ceases. \nA geas can be done away with by a wish \nspell, but a dispel magic or remove curse \nspell will not negate it. Your DM will decide \nany additional details of a geas, for its cast- \ning and fulfillment are tricky, and an \nimproperly cast geas is ignored. \n. \nGlusee (Alteration) \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto make a section of metal, stom, or wood \nas transparent as glass to his gaze, or even \nmake it into transparent material as \nexplained hereafter. Normally, up to four \ninches of metal can be seen through, stone \nup to six inches thick can be made transpar- \nby the g&ssee spell. The spell will not work \non lead, gold, or platinum. The wizard can \nopt to make the glassee work only for him- \nself for the duration of the @, or he can \nactually make a transparent area, a one- \nway window, in the materid affected. \nEther case gives a viewing area 3' wideby 2' \nhigh. If a window is created, it has the \nstrength of the original material. \nThe material component of the Spen ie a \nsmall piece of crystal or glass. \nRange: Touch \nent, and 20 inches of wood can be affected \nGla - \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/ld \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 5-foot-radius Sphe \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates an immobile, faintly \nshimmering, magical sphere around the \ncaster that prwents any 1st; 2nd-, 3rd-, or \n4th-level spell effects from penetrating. \nThus the area of effect of any such spell does \nnot include the area of the globe of invUlntIc \nability. This includes innate spen-like am- \nties and effects from devices. However, any \nsphere, and these pass from the caster of the \nglobe to the subject without effect upon the \nglobe. Fifth and high= level Spevs are not \naffected by the &be. The globe can be \nbrought down by a successful dispef magic \nSpell. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nglass or crystal bead that shatters at the \nexpiration of the spell. \nof Invulnerability FAbluntion) \nI \ntype of spell can be cast out of the magical \nI \nI \n177"
