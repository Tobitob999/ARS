    "text": "be very different indeed. The new incarna- \ntion is determined on the following table or \nby DM choice. If a player character race is \nindicated, the character must be created. At \nthe DMs option, certain special (expensive) \nincenses can be used that may increase the \nchance for a character to return as a specific \nrace or species. A wish spell can restore a \nreincarnated character to its original form \nand status. \nDlOO \nRoll Incarnation \n01-03 Badger \n04-08 Bear, black \n29-31 Elf \n59-61 Lynx \n62-64 \n76-80 Wolf \n81-85 Wolverine \n86-00 DMs choice \nIf an unusual creature form is indicated, \nthe DM can (at his option only) use the \nguidelines for new player character races to \nallow the character to earn experience and \nadvance in levels, although this may not be \nin the same class as before. If the reincarnat- \ned character returns as a creature eligible to \nbe the same class as he was previously (i.e., \na human fighter returns as an elf), the rein- \ncarnated character has half his previous \nlevels and hit points. If the character returns \nas a new character class, his hit points are \nhalf his previous total, but he must begin \nagain at 1st level. If the character returns as \na creature unable to have a class, he has half \nthe hit points and saving throws of his pre- \nvious incarnation. \nRatoratlon (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the life energy \nlevel of the recipient creature is raised by \none. This reverses any previous life energy \nlevel drain of the creature by a force or mon- \nster. Thus, if a 10th-level character had been \nstruck by a wight and drained to 9th level, \nthe restorution spell would bring the charac- \nter up to exactly the number of experience \npoints necessary to restore him to 10th level \nonce again, restoring additional Hit Dice (or \nhit points) and level functions accordingly. \nRestoration is effective only if the spell is \ncast within one day of the recipient's loss of \nlife energy, per experience level of the priest \ncasting it. A restorution spell restores the \nintelligence of a creature affected by a \nfeeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of \ninsanity. Casting this spell ages both the \ncaster and the recipient by two years. \nThe reverse, energy drain, draws away \none life energy level (see such undead as \nspectre, wight, and vampire, in the Mon- \nstrous Compendium). The energy drain \nrequires the victim to be touched. Casting \nthis form of the spell does not age the caster. \nResurrection (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe priest employing this spell is able to \nrestore life and complete strength to any living \ncreature, incluh elves, he bestows the resur- \nrection spell upon. The mature can have been \ndead up to 10 years per level of the priest cast- \ning the spell. Thus a 19th-level priest can res- \nurrect the bones of a apature dead up to 190 \nyears. The creature, upon surviving a resur- \nrection survival check, is immediately \nrestored to full hit points and can perfom \nstrenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back \na creature that has ded itsallotted lifespan \n(i.e., died of ~hval causes). Casting this spell \nmakes it impassible for the priest to cast fur- \nther spells or engage in combat until he has \nhad one day of bed rest for each experkm \nlevel or Hit Die of the creature brought back \nto life. Thecasteragesthree years upon cast- \ningthisspell. \nThe reverse, destruction, causes the vic- \ntim of the spell to be instantly dead and \nturned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is \nrequired for recovery. Destruction requires \na touch, either in combat or otherwise, and \ndoes not age the caster. In addition, the vic- \ntim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 \npenalty). If the save is successful, the victim \nreceives 8d6 points of damage instead. \nThe material components of the spell are \nthe priest's religious symbol and holy water \n(unholy water for the reverse spell). The \nDM may reduce the chances of successful \nresurrection if little of the creature's remains \nare available. \nSuccor (Alteration, Enchantment) \n: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 day \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the priest creates a \npowerful magic in some speciaIly prepared \nobject-a string of prayer beads, a small \nclay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object \nradiates magic, for it contains the power to \ninstantaneously transport its possessor to \nthe sanctuary of the priest who created its \nmagic. Once the item is enchanted, the \npriest must give it willingly to an individual, \nat the same time informing him of a com- \nmand word to be spoken when the item is to \nbe used. To make use of the item, the recipi- \nent must speak the command word at the \nsame time that he rends or breaks the item. \nWhen this is done, the individual and all \nthat he is wearing and carrying (up to the \nmaximum encumbrance limit for the char- \nacter) are instantly transported to the sanc- \ntuary of the priest, just as if the individual \nwere capable of speaking a word of recall \nspell. No other creatures can be affected. \nThe reversed application of the spen \ncauses the priest to be transported to the \nimmediate vicinity of the possessor of th* \nitem when it is broken and the command \nword said. The priest has a general idea of \nthe location and situation of the item's pok \nsessor, and can choose not to be affected by \nthis summons. This decision is made at the \ninstant when the transportation is to take \nplace, but if he chooses not to go, then the \nopportunity is gone forever and the spell ia \nwasted. \nThe cost of preparing the special item (for \neither version of the spell) varies from 2,000 \nto 5,000 gp. The more costly items can \ntransport the subject from one plane of \nexistence to another, if the DM allows. Note \nthat the same factors that can prevent the \noperation of the plune shift and teleport \nspells can also prevent the use of this spell. \nSunray (Evocation, Aheration) \nSphere: Sun \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 + ld4 rounds \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Sfoot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: Special \nWith this spell, the caster can evoke a \ndazzling beam of light each round in which \nno action other than movement is per- \nformed. The sunray is like a ray of natural \n(plus special)"
