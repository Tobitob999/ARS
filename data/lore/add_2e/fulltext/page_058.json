A \nspecific trick teaches the trained creature to \ndo one specific action. A horse may rear on \ncommand, a falcon may pluck a designated \nobject, a dog may attack a specific person, \nor a rat may run through a particular maze. \n~ With enough time, a creature can be trained \n' -to do both general tasks and specific tricks. \nTraining for a general task requires three \nmonths of uninterrupted work. Training for \na specific trick requires M6 weeks. At the \nend of the training time, a proficiency check \nis made. If successful, the animal is trained. \nIf the die roll fails, the beast is untrainable. \nAn animal can be trained in 2d4 general \ntasks or specific tricks, or any combination \nof thetwo. \nAn animal trainer can also try to tame \nwild animals (preparing them for training \nlater on). Wild animals can be tamed only \nwhen they are very young. The taming \nrequires one month of uninterrupted work \nwith the creature. At the end of the month, a \nproficiency check is made. If successful, the \nbeast is suitable for training. If the check \nfails, the creature retains enough of its wild \nbehavior to make it untrainable. It can be \nkept, though it must be leashed or caged. \nAppraising: This proficiency is highly \nuseful for thieves, as it allows characters to \nestimate the value and authenticity of \nantiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gem- \nstones, or other crafted items they find \n(although the DM can exclude those items \ntoo exotic or rare to be well known). The \ncharacter must have the item in hand to \nexamine. A successful proficiency check \n(rolled by the DM) enables the character to \nestimate the value of the item to the nearest \n100 or 1,ooO gp and to identify fakes. On a \nfailed check, thecharacter cannot estimate a \nprice at all. On a roll of 20, the character \nwildly misreads the value of the item, \nalways to the detriment of the character. \nArmorer: This character can make all of \nthe types of armor listed in the Players \nHandbook, given the proper materials and \nfacilities. When making armor, the profi- \nciency check is rolled at the end of the nor- \nmal construction time. \nThe time required to make armor is equal \nto two weeks per level of AC below 10. For \nexample, a shield would require two weeks \nof work, whereas a suit of full plate armor \nwould require 18 weeks of work. \nIf the proficiency check indicates failure \nbut is within 4 of the amount needed for suc- \ncess, the armorer has created usable, but \nflawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 \nAC worse than usual, although it looks like \nthe armor it was intended to be. Only a \ncharacter with armorer proficiency can \ndetect the flaws, and this requires careful \nand detailed inspection. \nIf the flawed armor is struck in meIee \ncombat with a natural die roll of 19 or 20. it \nbreaks. The character's AC immediately \nworsens by 4 additional classes (although \nnever above IO), and the broken armor \nhampers the character's movement. Until \nthe character can remove the broken armor \n(a process requiring ld4 rounds), the char- \nacter moves at 1h of his normal rate and suf- \nfers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls. \nIf an armorer is creating a suit of field \nplate or full plate armor, the character who \nwill use the armor must be present at least \nonce a week during the creation of the \narmor, since such types of armor require \nvery exact fitting. \nArtistic Ability: Player characters with \nartistic ability are naturally accomplished in \nvarious forms of the arts. They have an \ninherent understanding of color, form, \nspace, flow, tone, pitch, and rhythm. Char- \nacters with artistic ability must select one \nart form (painting, sculpture, composition, \netc.) to be proficient in. Thereafter they can \nattempt to create art works or musical com- \npositions in their given field. Although it is \nnot necessary to makb a proficiency check, \none can be made to determine the quality of \nthe work. If a 1 is rolled on the check, the \nartist has created a work with some truly \nlasting value. If the check fails, the artist has \ncreated something aesthetically unpleasing \nor just plain bad. \nArtistic ability also confers a + 1 bonus to \nall proficiency checks requiring artistic \nskill-music or dance-and to attempts to \nappraise objects of art. \nAstrology: This proficiency gives the \ncharacter some understanding of the sup- \nposed influences of the stars. Knowing the \nbirth date and time of any person, the \nastrologer can study the stars and celestial \nevents and then prepare a forecast of the \nfuture for that person. The astrologer's \ninsight into the future is limited to the next \n30 days, and his knowledge is vague at best. \nIf a successful proficiency check is made, the \nastrologer can foresee some genera \n57 \na great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship \nmade, etc. The DM decides the exact predic- \ntion (based on his intentions for the next few \ngaming sessions). Note that the prediction \ndoes not guarantee the result-it only indi- \ncates the potential result. If the proficiency \ncheck is failed, no information is gained \nunless a 20 is rolled, in which case the pre- \ndiction is wildly inaccurate. \nClearly this proficiency requires prepara- \ntion and advance knowledge on the part of \nthe DM. Because of this, it is permhible for \nthe DM to avoid the question, although this \nshouldn't be done all the time. Players who \nwant to make their DMs life easier (always \na good idea) should consider using this pro- \nficiency at the end of a gaming don, giv- \ning the DM until the next don to come up \nwith an answer. The DM can use this profi- \nciency as a catalyst and guide for his \nadventures-something that will prompt \nthe player characters to go to certain places \nor to try new things. \nCharacters with the astrology proficiency \ngain a + 1 bonus to all navigation proficien- \ncy checks, provided the stars can be seen. \nBlacksmithing: A character with black- \nsmithing proficiency is capable of making \ntools and implements from iron. Use of the \nproficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed \nfire and bellows, as well as a hammer and \nanvil. The character cannot make armor or \nmost weapons, but can craft crowbars, \ngrappling hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, \nplows, and most other iron objects. \nBHnd-fightht~ A character drh blind- \nfighting is skilled at fighting in conditions of \npoor or no light (but this proficiency does \nnot allow spell use). In total darkness, the \ncharacter suffers only a -2 penalty to his \nattack roll (as compared to a -4 penalty \nwithout this proficiency). Under starlight or \nmoonlight, the character incurs only a -1 \npenalty. The character suffers no penalties \nto his AC because of darkness. \nFurthermore, the character retains special \nabilities that would normally be lost in \ndarkness, although the effectiveness of these \nare reduced by one-half (phcy checks \nare made at half the nom1 score, et.). \nThis proficiency is effestive only against \nopponents or threats within melee distance \nof the character. Blind-fighting does not \ngrant any special protection from missile \nfire or anything outside the immediate range \nof the character's melee weapon. Thus AC \npenalties remain for missile fire. (By the \ntime the character hears the whoosh of the \narrow, for example, it is too late for him to \nreact.) \nWhile moving in darkness, the character \nsuffers only half the normal movement pen- \nalty of those without this proficiency. \nFurthermore, this skill aids the character \nwhen dealing with invisible creatures, \nreducing the attack penalty to -2. How- \nr, it does not enable the character to dis- \nf"
