    "text": "Ir \nIf \nThe spell functions when specific condi- \ntions are fulfilled, according to the com- \nmand of the spellcaster. Some examples are \nto speak \"to the first creature that touches \nyou,\" or \"to the first creature that passes \nwithin 30 feet .\" Commands can be as general \nor as detailed as desired, although only vis- \nual and audible triggers can be used, such as \nthe following: \"Speak only when a venera- \nble female human carrying a sack of groat \nclusters sits crosslegged within one foot.\" \nSuch visual triggers can react to a character \nusing the disguise ability. Command range \nis five yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th- \nlevel wizard can command the magic mouth \nto speak at a maximum encounter range of \n30 yards (\"Speak when a winged creature \ncomes within 30 yards.\"). The spell lasts un- \ntil the speak command can be fulfilled, thus \nthe spell duration is variable. A magic \nmouth cannot distinguish invisible crea- \ntures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, \nexcept by external garb. If desired, the effect \ncan be keyed to a specific noise or spoken \nword. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall bit of honeycomb. \nMelf's Acid AROW (Conjuration) \nRange 180 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 target \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \na magical arrow that speeds to its target as if \nfired from the bow of a fighter of the same \nlevel as the wizard. No modifiers for range, \nnon-proficiency, or specialization are used. \nThe arrow has no attack or damage bonus, \nbut it inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage \n(with saving throws for items on the target). \n(There is no splash damage.) For every three \nlevels that the caster has achieved, the acid \nlasts for another round, unless somehow \nneutralized, inflicting another 2d4 points of \ndamage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the \nacid lasts two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the \nacid lasts for three rounds, etc. \nThe material components of the spell are \na dart, powdered rhubarb leaf, and an ad- \nder's stomach. \nbw \nMinor Image (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: &foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a mirror image spell is invoked, thc \nspellcaster causes from two to eight exac \nduplicates of himself to come into beiq \naround him. These images do exactly whal \nthe wizard does. Since the spell causes i \nblurring and slight distortion when it is cast, \nit is impossible for opponents to be certain \nwhich are the illusions and which is the ac- \ntual wizard. When an image is struck by a \nmelee or missile attack, magical or other- \nwise, it disappears, but any other existing \nimages remain intact until struck. The im- \nages seem to shift from round to round, so \nthat if the actual wizard is struck during one \nround, he cannot be picked out from among \nhis images the next. To determine the num- \nber of images that appear, roll ld4 and add 1 \nfor every three levels of experience the wiz- \nard has achieved, to a maximum of eight im- \nages. At the end of the spell duration, all \nsurviving images wink out. \nirection (IllusiodPhPntasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 8 hours \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the wizard misdi- \nrects the information from a detection spell \n(detect cham, detect mil, detect invisibil- \nity, detect lie, defect magic, detect snares \nand pits, etc.). While the detection spell \nfunctions, it indicates the wrong area, crea- \nture, or the opposite of the truth with re- \nspect to detect evil or detect lie. The wizard \ndirects the spell effect upon the object of the \ndetection spell. If the caster of the detection \nspell fails his saving throw vs. spell, the mis- \ndirection takes place. Note that this spell \ndoes not affect other types of divination \n(know alignment, augury, ESe claimoy- \nance, etc.). \nProtection From Cantrips (Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 5 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature or object touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy casting this spell, the wizard receives \nimmunity to the effects of cantrips cast by \nother wizards, apprentices, or creatures that \n144 \nuse the cantrfp spell. The spell protects the \ncaster, or one item or person that he touches \n(such as a spell book or a drawer containing \nspell components). Any cantrip cast against \nthe protected person or item dissipates with \nan audible popping sound. This spell is of- \nten used by a wizard who has mischievous \napprentices, or one who wishes apprentices \nto clean or shine an area using elbow grease \nrather than magic. Any unwilling target of \nthis spell must be touched (via an attack \nroll) and is allowed a saving throw vs. spell \nto escape the effect. \nPyrotechnics (&&ration) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 fire source (special) \nSaving Throw: None \nA pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing \nfire source to produce either of two effects, \nat the option of the caster. First, it can pro- \nduce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, \ncolored aerial fireworks that lasts one \nround. This effect temporarily blinds those \ncreatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the \narea and that have an unobstructed line of \nsight to the burst. Creatures viewing this are \nblinded for ld4 + 1 rounds unless they SIC- \ncessfully save vs. spell. The fireworks fill a \nvolume ten times greater than that of the \nxiginal fire source. \nThis spell can also cause a thick, writhing \nitream of smoke to arise from the source \nand form a choking cloud that lasts for one \nmound per experience level of the caster. This \n:overs a roughly spherical volume from the \nyound or floor up (or conforming to the \nhape of a confined area) that totally ob- \nmres vision beyond two feet. The smoke \nills a volume 100 times that of the fire \nource. All within the cloud must rolI 8uc- \n*essful saving throws vs. spell or suffer -2 \nmalties to all combat rolls and &or \n:lass. \nThe spell uses one fire source within a 20- \noot cube, which is immediately extin- \nuished. An extremely large fire used as a \nource might be only partially extinguished. \ndagical fires are not extinguished, although \nfire-based mature (such as a fire elemen- \nat) used as a source suffers 1 point of dam- \nge per caster level."
