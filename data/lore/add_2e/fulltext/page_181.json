    "text": "Wizard Spells (6th Level) \nThe spell cannot be used for tunneling, \nand is generally too slow to trap or bury \ncreatures; its primary use is for digging or \nfilling moats or for adjusting terrain con- \ntours before a battle. \nThe material components for this s@ll are \na mixture of soils (clay, loam, sand) in a \nsmall bag and an iron blade. \nNote: This spell does not violently break \nthe surface of the ground. Instead it creates \nwave-like crests and troughs, with the earth \nreacting with glacier-like fluidity until the \ndesired result is achieved. Trees, structures, \nrock formations, and so on, are relatively \nunaffected, save for changes in elevation \nand relative topography. \nWluke’s Freezing Sphere \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: Special \nCodpon$lts V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nOtiluke’s Freezing Sphere is a multi- \npurpose spell of considerable power. If the \ncaster opts, he may create any of the follow- \ning: \nA) Frigid globe. A small globe of matter at \nabsolute zero temperature that spreads \nupon contact with water, or a liquid that is \nprincipally water, freezing it to a depth of \nsix inches over an area equal to 100 square \nfeet per level of the mage casting the spell. \nThis ice lasts for one round per level of the \ncaster. \nThe material component is a thin sheet of \ncrystal about an inch square. \nB) Cold ray. The spell can also be used as a \nthin ray of cold that springs from the caster’s \nhand to a distance of 10 yards per level of \nthe wizard; this ray inflicts ld4 +2 points of \ndamage per level of the caster upon the first \ncreature struck. A saving throw vs. spell is \napplicable; all damage is negated if it is suc- \ncessful (as the ray is so narrow a save indi- \ncates it missed). If the first creature is \nmissed, the path of the ray is plotted to its \nfull distance, and anything else in its path \nmust save (if applicable) or suffer appropri- \nate damage. \nThe material component is a white sap- \nphire of not less than 1,OOO gp value. \nC) Globe of cold. This creates a small globe \nabout the size of a sling stone, cool to the \ntouch, but not harmful. This globe can be \nhurled, either by hand to a distance of 40 \nyards (considered short range), or as a sling \nbullet. The globe shatters upon impact, \ninflicting 6d6 points of cold damage upon \nall creatures within a 10-foot radius (one- \nhalf damage if a saving throw vs. spell is \nsuccessful). Use the Dungeon Muster’s \nGuide Grenade-Like Missile Table to find \nwhere misses strike. Note that if the globe is \nnot thrown or slung within one round per \nlevel of the spell-caster, it shatters and \ncauses cold damage as stated above. This \ntimed effect can be employed against pursu- \ners, although it can prove hazardous to the \nspellcaster and his associates as well. \nThe material component is a 1,OOO-gp \ndiamond. \nPart Water (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy employing a part water spell, the wiz- \nard is able to cause water or similar liquid to \nmove apart, thus forming a 20-foot-wide \ntrough. The depth and length of the trough \nare dependent upon the level of the wizard, \nand a trough three feet deep by 10 yards \nlong is created per level. For example, at \n12th level the wizard would part water 36 \nfeet deep by 20 feet wide by 120 yards long. \nThe trough remains as long as the spell lasts \nor until the wizard who cast it opts to end its \neffects. If cast underwater, this spell creates \nan air cylinder of appropriate length and \ndiameter. If cast directly on a water elemen- \ntal or other water-based creature, the crea- \nture receives 4d8 damage and must roll a \nsuccessful saving throw vs. spell or flee in \npanic for 3d4 rounds. \nThe material components for the spell are \ntwo small sheets of crystal or glass. \nPermanent Illusion @lusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \n.Components: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nan illusion with visual, auditory, olfactory, \nand thermal elements. The spell can create \nthe illusion of any object, creature, or force, \nas long as it is within the boundaries of the \nspell’s area of effect. It affects all creatures \nthat view the illusion, even to the extent of \nthem suffering damage from falling into an \nillusory pit full of sharp spikes. \nCreatures that attempt to disbelieve the \nillusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if \nsuccessful, they see it for what it is and add \n+4 bonuses to associates’ saving throws, if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect \nare immune until they become aware of it. \nThe permanent illusion is subject to a dispel \nmagic spell, of course. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of fleece. \nProgrammed Illusion \n(IIlusionlPhurterm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 20’ cube + 10’ &/led \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a spectral force \nthat activates upon command or when a \nspecific condition occurs. The illusion has \nvisual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal ele- \nments. It can be of any object, mature, or \nforce, as long as it remains within the \nboundaries of the spell’s area of effect. \nThe occurrence that begins the illusion \ncan be as general or as specific and detailed \nas desired, such as the following: “Begin \nonly when a venerable female human carry- \ning a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged \nwithin one foot of this spot.” Such visual \ntriggers can react to a character using the \ndisguise ability. Command rm is five \nyards per level of the wizard, 80 a 12th-level \nmage can command the programmed illu- \nsion to occur at a maximum encounter \nrange of 60 yards. A programmed illusion \ncannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor \naliment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except \nby external garb. If desired, the effect can be \nkeyed to a specific noise or spoken word. \nThe spell lasts until the illusion occurs, thus \nthe spell duration is variable. The illusion \nwill last for a maximum of one round per \nlevel of the spellcaster. \nCreatures that attempt to disbelieve the \nillusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if \nsuccessful, they see it for what it is and add \n+4 bonuses to associates‘ saving throws, if \nthis knowledge can be communicated effec- \ntively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect \nare immune until they become aware of it. \nThe illusion is subject to a dispel magic \nspell. \nThe material component of the sjd is a \nbit of fleece. \nProject Image \n(Alteration, Rlusion/Phantrsm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard cre \na nonmaterial duplicate of himself, project- \ning it to any spot within spell range.
