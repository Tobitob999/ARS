These are organized ac- \ncording to groups. Information that applies \nto the entire group is presented at the start of \nthe section. Each character class within the \ngroup is then explained. \nThe descriptions use game terms that may \nbe unfamiliar to you; many of these are ex- \nplained in this text (or you may look the \nterms up in the Glossary). \nExperience Points measure what a char- \nacter has learned and how he has improved \nhis skill during the course of his adventures. \nCharacters earn experience points by com- \npleting adventures and by doing things spe- \ncifically related to their class. A fighter, for \nexample, earns more experience for charg- \ning and battling a monster than does a thief, \nbecause the fighter's training emphasizes \nbattle while the thief's emphasizes stealth \nand cleverness. Characters accumulate ex- \nperience points from adventure to adven- \nture. When they .accumulate enough, they \nrise to the next level of experience, gaining \nadditional abilities and powers. The experi- \nence level tables for each character group \nlist the total, accumulated experience points \nneeded to reach each level. \nence level. Your DM will tell YOU the re- \nquirement ancem \ntime come \nLevel is a measure of the character's power. \nA begumkg character starts at 1st level. To ad- \nvance to the next level, the character must \nearn a requisite number of experience points. \nI3JfBarcnt character classes improve at differ- \nent rates. Each incmwe in level improves the \n~swwivabilityandskills. \nPcbe Reqddte is the ability score or \nscoaes that are most important to a particu- \n4 rlrta9. A fighter must be strong and a \nmapamst be intelligent; their prime requi- \nsh, therefore, are Strength and Intelli- \ngence, respectively. Some character classes \nhave more than one prime requisite. Any \ncharacter who has a score of 16 or more in \nallhis prime requisites gains a 10 percent bo- \nnus to his experience point awards. \nWarrior \nThe warrior group \nencompasses the character classes of heroes \nwho make their way in the world primarily \nby skill at arms: fighters, paladins, and \nrangers. \nWarriors are allowed to use any weapon. \nThey can wear any type of armor. Warriors \nget 1 to 10 (Idlo) hit points per level and can \ngain a special Constitution hit point bonus \nthat is available only to warriors. \nThe disadvantage warriors have is that \nthey are restricted in their selection of magi- \ncal items and spells. \nAll warriors use Table 14 to determine \ntheir advancement in level as they earn ex- \nperience points. \nAll warriors gain one IO-sided hit die per \nlevel from 1st through 9th. After 9th level, \nwanion gain just 3 hit points per level and \nthey no longer gain additional hit point bo- \nnuses for high Constitution scores. \nTable 14 WARRIOR EXPERIENCE \nLEVELS \nHit \nPaladin/ Dice \nLevel Fighter Ranger (dlo) \n1 0 0 1 \n2 2,000 2,250 2 \n3 4.000 4.500 3 \n7 64,000 75,000 7 \n8 125,000 150,ooO 8 \n9 250.000 300.000 9 \n14 1,500,000 1,800,000 9+15 \n20 3,000,000 3,600,000 9+33 \nAll warriors gain the ability to make \nmore than one melee attack per round as \nthey rise in level. Table 15 shows how many \nmelee attacks fighters, paladins, and rang- \ners can make per round, as a function of \ntheir levels. \nTable 15: WARRIOR MELEE AlTACKS \nWarrior Level AttadcdRound \n1-6 l/round \n7-12 3/2 rounds \n13&up 2/round \nPER ROUND \nFighter \nAbility Requirements: Strength 9 \nPrime Requisite: Strength \nAllowed Races: All \nThe principal attribute of a fighter is \nStrength. To become a fighter, a character \nmust have a minimum Strength score of 9. \nA good Dexterity rating is highly desirable. \nA fighter who has a Strength score (his \nprime requisite) of 16 or more gains a 10 per- \ncent bonus to the experience pointsheeams. \nAlso, high Strength gives the fighter a \nbetter chance to hit an opponent and en- \nables him to cause more damage. \nter 1s a warnor, an expert in weap- \nons and, if he is clever, tactics and strategy. \nThere are many famous fighters from leg- \nend: Hercules, Perseus, Hiawatha, \nBeowulf, Siegfried, Cuchulain, Little John, \nTristan, and Sinbad. History is crowded \nwith great generals and warriors: El Cid, \nHannibal, Alexander the Great, Charle- \nmagne, Spartacus, Richard the Lionheart, \nand Belisarius. Your hghter could be mod- \neled after any of these, or he could be \nunique.

Weapon \nspecialization enables the fighter to use a \nparticular weapon with exceptional skill, \nimproving his chances to hit and cause dam- \nage with that weapon. A fighter character is \nnot required to specialize in a weapon; the \nchoice is up to the player. No other charac- \nter class-not even ranger or paladin-is al- \nlowed weapon specialization. \nWhile fighters cannot cast magiul @is, \nthey can use many magical items, inohrlfng \npotions, protection scrolls, most r&p, and \nall forms of enchanted armor, wtlp(w10, urd \nshields. \nWhen a fighter attains 9th lewd cbccames \na \"Lord), he can automatidy attract men- \nat-arms. These sofdiers, having heard of thr \nfighter, come for the dwce to gain fame, \nloris adventure, and cash. They \nas they are well-treated, and \npaid well. Abusive treatn-mt or a disastrous \ncampaign can lead to grumbling, dcsation, \nand possibly mutiny. To attract the men, the \nfighter must have a castle or stron&c&d and \nsizeable manor lands around it. As he \nclaims and rules this land, soldkls $owmy \nto his domain, thereby incredhg his power. \nFurthermore, the fighter can tax iurd de- \nvelop these lands, gaining a steady income \nfrom them. Your DM has information about \ngaining and ming a barony. \nIn addition to regular men-at-arms, the \n9th-level fighter also attracts an elite body- \nguard (his '%household guards\"). Although \nthese soldiers are still mercenaries, they \nhave greater loyalty to their Lord than do \ncommon soldiers. In return, they expect bet- \nter treatment and more pay than the com- \nmon soldier receives. Although the elite unit \ncan be chosen randomly, it is better to ask \nyour DM what unit your fighter attracts. \nThis allows him to choose a troop consistent \nwith the campaign. \n26"
