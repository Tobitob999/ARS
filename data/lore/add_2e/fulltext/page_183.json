    "text": "c.- PI Wizard Spells (7th Level) \nnated, all subsequent damage (to his true hit \npoints) is doubled. The Armor Class of the \nwizard is 4 better than that he possessed pri- \nor to casing the spell (AC 10 goes to 6, AC 9 \nto 5, AC 8 to 4, etc.), to a maximum Armor \nClass of -10. \nAU attacks are as a fighter of the same \nlevel as the wizard (Le., the wizard uses the \ncombat values normally reserved for fight- \ners). The wizard can use either a dagger or a \nstaff when attacking. A dagger can be used \ntwice per roFd, and each successful attack \ninflicts an additional 2 points of damage. A \nstaff can be used only once per round, but \nwith a +2 bonus to attack and damage \nrolls. The wizard fights in melee in prefer- \nence to all other forms of attack, and con- \ntinues attacking until all opponents are \nslain, he is killed, the magic is dispelled, or \nthe spell duration expires. \nThe material component for casting this \nspell is a potion of heroism (or superhero- \nism) that the wizard must consume during \nthe course of uttering the spell. \nlkansmute Water to Dust (Alteration) \nRevetsibk \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDurah: Permanent \nCasting Time 5 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None (special) \nWhen this spell is cast, the subject area \ninstantly undergoes a change from liquid to \npowdery dust. Note that if the water is \nalready muddy, the area of effect is doubled, \nwhile if wet mud is being transmuted, the \narea of effect is quadrupled. If water \nremains in contact with the transmuted \ndust, the former quickly soaks the latter, \nturning the dust into silty mud, if a suffi- \ncient quantity of water exists to do so, oth- \nerwise soaking or dampening the dust \naccordingly. \nOnly liquid actually in the area of effect \nat the moment of spellcasting is affected. \nLiquids that are only partially water are \naffected only insofar as the actual water \ncontent is concerned, except that potions \ncontaining water are rendered useless. Liv- \ning creatures are unaffected, except for \nthose native to the elemental plane of Water. \nSuch creatures receive saving throws vs. \nspell. Failure inflicts ld6 points of damage \nper caster level upon the subject, while suc- \ncess means the creature receives but half \ndamage. Only one such creature can be \naffected by any single casting of this spell, \nregardless of the creature's size or the size of \nthe spell's area of effect. \nThe reverse of the spell is simply a very \nhigh-powered create water spell that \nrequires a pinch of normal dust as an add- . \ntional material component. \n1 \n' \nFor either usage of the spell, other compo- \nnents required are diamond dust of at least \n500 gp value and a bit of seashell. \nTrue Seeing (Divination) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: &foot light range \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard employs this spell, he \nconfers upon the recipient the ability to see \nall things as they actually are. The spell pen- \netrates normal and magical darkness. Secret \ndoors become plain. The exact location of \ndisplaced things is obvious. Invisible things \nbecome visible. Illusions and apparitions \nare seen through. Polymorphed, changed, \nor enchanted objects are apparent. (The real \nform appears translucently super-imposed \non the apparent form: a gold dragon poly- \nmorphed to human form would appear \nhuman with a ghostly dragon looming over \nthe human form.) Unlike the clerical version \nof this spell, the recipient cannot determine \nalignment. The recipient can focus his \nvision to see into the Ethereal plane or the \nbordering areas of adjacent planes. The \nrange of vision conferred is 60 feet. True see- \ning does not penetrate solid objects: it in no \nway confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. \nFurthermore, the spell effects cannot be \nenhanced with magic. \nThe spell requires an ointment for the \neyes that is made from a very rare mush- \nroom powder, saffron, and fat. It costs no \nless than 300 gp per use and must be aged for \nld6 months. \nVeil (Illusior~Phantasrn) \nRange: 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Fffect: 20-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThe veil spell enables the d to instantly \nchange the appearance of his surroundhgs \nand party or to atate hallucinatory terrain so \nas to fool even the most dewr creatures unless \nthey have the true seeing spell, a gem of see- \ning, or similar magical aid. The veil m make \na sumptuous room seem a filthy den and even \ntactile impressions conform to the visual illu- \nsion. Likewise, a party might be made to \nresemble a mixed band of brownies, pixies, \nand faeriesled by a treant. If hallucinatory ter- \nrain is created, touch does not cause it to van- \nish. \nd.l \nI' \n3 \n1 1 \nSeventh-Level Spells \nBanishment (Abjuration) \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures \nRange: 20 yards \nin a @foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nA banishment spell enables the caster to \nforce some extrapIanar creature out of the \ncaster's home plane. The effect is instantane- \nous, and the subject cannot come back with- \nout some special summoning or means of \negress from its own plane to the one from \nwhich it was banished. Up to 2 Hit Dice or \nlevels of creature per caster level can be ban- \nished. \nThe caster must both name the type of \ncreature(s) to be sent away and give its \nname and title as well, if any. In any event, \nthe creature's magic resistance must be \ndefeated for the speli to be effective. \nThe material components of the spell are \nsubstances harmfuI, hateful, or opposed to \nthe nature of the subject(s) of the spell. For \nevery such substance included in the cast- \ning, the subject creature(s) loses 5 % from its \nmagic resistance and suffers a - 2 penalty to \nits saving throw vs. spell. For example, if \niron, holy waterv sunstone, and a sprig of \nrosemary were used in casting a banishment \nupon a bemg that hates those things, its sav- \ning throw versus the spell would be made"
