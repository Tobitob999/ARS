The spell remains until \nthe magical hedge is somehow broken. \nMetamorphosis: Causes the subject to \nchange to some noncorporeal form, save for \nits head or face. The binding is permanent \nuntil some prescribed act fr&s the subject. \nMinimus Containment: The subject is \nshrunken to a height of one inch or even less \nand held within the hedged prison of some \ngem or similar object. The subject of a mini- \nmus containment, metamorphosis, or \nhedged prison radiates a very faint aura of \n% type of binding does not modify the \nmvimg thmw for the chaining form of the \n@. Shwber allows the subject a +1 \nbarn, bound slumber a +2 bonus, hedged \nlprvnr a +3 bonus, metamorphosis a +4 \nL d minimus containment a +5 \nbd-to the saving throw. However, if the \ndjkt b magically weakened, the referee \n--a -1, -2,oreven -4penaltyto \nthe saving throw. A successful saving throw \nenables the subject to burst its bonds and do \nas it pleases. \nA binding spell can be renewed in the case \nof the first three forms of the syll, for the \nsubject does not have the opportunity to \nbreak the bonds. (If anything has caused a \nweakening of a chaiiing or slumber version, \nsuch as attempts to contact the subject or \nmagically touch it, a normal saving throw \napplies to the renewal of the spell.) Other- \nwise, after one year, and each year thereaf- \nter, the subject gains a normal saving throw \nvs. the spell. Whenever it is successful, the \nbinding spell is broken and the creature is \nfree. \nClone (Necromancy) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Perqanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates a duplicate of a human, \ndemihuman, or humanoid creature. This \ndone is in most respects the duplicate of the \nindividual, complete to the level of experi- \nence, memories, etc. However, the dupli- \ncate really is the person, so that if the \noriginal and a duplicate exist at the same \ntime, each knows of the other’s existence; \nand the original person and the clone will \neach desire to do away with the other, for \nsuch an alter-ego is unbearable to both. If \none cannot destroy the other, one will go \ninsane (90% likely to be the clone) and \ndestroy itself, or possibly (2% chance) both \nwill become mad and destroy themselves. \nThese events nearly always occur within \none week of the dual existence. Note that \nthe clone is the person as he existed at the \ntime at which the flesh was taken, and all \nsubsequent knowledge, experience, etc., is \ntotally unknown to the clone. The clone is a \nphysical duplicate, and possessions of the \noriginal are another matter entirely. A clone \ntakes 2d4 months to grow, and on€y after \nthat time is dual existence established. \nFinally, the clone has one less Constitution \npoint than the body it was cloned from, and \nthe cloning fails if the clone would have a \nConstitution of 0. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nsmall piece of the flesh from the person to be \nduplicated. \nThe DM may, in addition, add other stip- \nulations to the success of a cloning effort, \nrequiring that some trace of life must remain \nin the flesh sample, that some means of stor- \ning and preserving the sample must be \ndevised and maintained, etc. \nDemand \n(Evocation, EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is very much like the 5th-level \nwizard spell sending, allowing a brief con- \ntact with a far distant creature, except that \nthe message can also contain a suggestion \n(see 3rd-level wizard spell), which the sub- \nject will do its best to carry out if it fails its \nsaving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty. \nOf course, if the message is impossible or \nmeaningless according to the circumstances \nthat exist for the subject at the time the \ndemand comes, the message is understood \nbut no saving throw is necessary and the \nsuggestion is ineffective. \nThe caster must be familiar with the crea- \nture contacted and must know its name and \nappearance well. If the creature in question \nis not in the same plane of existence as the \nspellcaster, there is a base 5% chance that \nthe demand does not arrive. Local condi- \ntions on other planes may worsen this \nchance considerably at the option of the \nDM. The demand, if received, will be \nunderstoodeven if the creature has an Intel- \nligence ability score as low as 1 (animal \nIntelligence). Creatures of demigod status \nor higher can choose to come or not, as they \nplease. \nThe demand message to the creature must \nbe 25 words or less, including the sugges- \ntion. The creature can also give a short reply \nimmediately. \nThe material components of the spell are \na pair of cylinders, each open at one end, \nConnected by a thin piece of copper wire and \nsome small part of the subject creature-a \nhair, bit of nail, etc. \nClustecl (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Object touc..ed \nSaving Throw: None \nThe glassteel spell turns normal, non- \nmagical crystal or glass into a transparent \nsubstance that has the tensile strength and \nunbreakability of actual steel. Only a rela- \ntively small volume of material can be \naffected, a maximum weight of 10 pounds \nper level of experience of the spellcaster, and \nit must form one whole object. The Armor \nClass of the substance is 1. \nThe material components of this spell are \na small piece of glass and a small piece of \nsteel. \nIncendiary Cloud \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + ld6 rounds \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: V2 \nAn incendiary cloud spell exactly resem- \nbles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics \nspell, except that its minimum dimensions \nare a cloud of 10-foot height by 20-foot \nlength and breadth. This dense vapor cloud \nbillows forth, and on the third round of its \nexistence it begins to flame, causing 1-2 \npoints of damage per level of the wizard \nwho cast it. On the fourth round it inflicts \nld4 points of damage per level of the caster, \nand on the fifth round this again drops to \n1-2 points of damage per level as its flames \nburn out. Any successive rounds of exist- \nence are simply harmless smoke that \nobscures vision within its confirtes. Cna- \ntures within the cloud need to make only \none saving throw if it is successful, but if \nthey fail the first saving throw, they roll \nagain on the fourth and fifth rounds (if nec- \nessary) to attempt to due damage sus- \ntained by one-half. \nIn order to cast this spell, the wizard must \nhave an available fire source (just as with a \npyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath \na dung pile, and a pinch of dust. \n1 89"
