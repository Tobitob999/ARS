    "text": "Chapter 5: Proficiencies (Optional) \nMost of what a player character can do is \ndefined by his race, class, and ability scores. \nThese three characteristics don't cover every- \nthing, however. Characters can have a wide \nrange of talents, from the potent (and intri- \ncate) arts of magic to the simple and mundane \nknowledge of how to build a good fire. The \ncharacter's magical ability (or lack theteoo is \ndefined by his class. Lesser abilities, such as \nfire building, are defined by profiaencies. \nA Proficiency is a learned skill that isn't \nessential to the character's class. A ranger, for \nexample, may find it useful to know some- \nthing about navigation, espedally if he lives \nnear an ocean or seacoast. On the other hand, \nhe isn't likely to suffer if he doesn't know how \nto navigate; he is a ranger, not a sailor. \nproficiencies are divided into two pups: \nweapon proficiencies (those Elated to weap \nons and combat) and nonweapon pro- \nficimcies (those related to everything else). \nAll proficiency rules are additions to the \ngame. hpn proficiencies are tournament- \nlevel rules, optional in regular play, and non- \nweapon profiaencies are completely optional. \nproficiencies are not necmary for a balanced \ngame. They add at\\ additional dimension to \ncharacters, however, and anything that \nenriches characterization is a bonus. If weap- \non profiaencies are used in your game, expect \nthem to apply to all characters, including \nNPCs. Nonweapon profiaencies may be used \nby players who enjoy them and ignored by \nthose who don't without giving unfair advan- \ntages to anyone (provided your DM allows \nthis; he's the one who must deal with any \nProljkms). \nOnce a proficiency slot is filled, it can \nnever be changed or reassigned. \nAcquiring Proficiencies \nEven newly cre- \nated, 1st-level characters have proficiencies. \nThe number of proficiency slots that a char- \nacter starts with is determined by his group, \nas shown in Table 34. Each proficiency slot \nis empty until the player \"fills\" it by select- \ning a proficiency. If your DM allows non- \nweapon proficiencies, the character's \nIntelligence score can modify the number of \nslots he has, granting him more proficien- \ncies (see page 16). In both cases, new profi- \nciencies are learned the same way. \nConsider the case of Rath, a dwarf fight- \ner. Table 34 gives him four weapon profi- \nciency slots (he is a warrior). If nonweapon \nproficiencies are used, he has three slots and \nhis Intelligence of 11 gives him two addi- \ntional proficiency slots (according to Table \n4, page 16) for a total of five nonweapon \nproficiency slots. The player must assign \nweapon or nonweapon proficiencies to all \nof these slots before the character goes on \nhis first adventure. These represent what the \ncharacter has learned before be \nadventuring career. \nTable 34: PROFICIENCY SLOTS \nWeapon Nonweapon \nProfidendes Profidendes \nGroup Initial #Levels Penalty Mtial #Levels \nWarrior 4 3 -2 3 3 \nWizard 1 6 -5 4 3 \nPriest 2 4 -3 4 3 \nRogue 2 4 -3 3. 4 \nThereafter, as the character advances in \nexperience levels, he gains additional profi- \nciency slots. The rate at which he gains them \ndepends on the group he belongs to. Table \n34 lists how many weapon and nonweapon \nproficiency slots the character starts with, \nand how many levels the character must \ngain before he earns another slot. \nInitial Weapon Proficiendes is the num- \nber of weapon proficiency slots received by \ncharacters of that group at 1st level. \n#Levels (for both weapon and non- \nweapon proficiencies) tells how quickly a \ncharacter gains additional proficiency slots. \nA new proficiency slot is gained at every \nexperience level that is evenly divisible by \nthe number listed. Rath (a warrior), for \nexample, gains one weapon proficiency slot \nat every level evenly divisible by 3. He gets \none new slot at 3rd level, another at 6th, \nanother at 9th, and 90 on. (Note that Rath \nalso gains one nonweapon proficiency at \n3rd, 6th. 9th, etc.) \nPenalty is the modifier to the character's \nattack rolls when he fights using a weapon \nhe is not proficient with. Rath, a dwarf, \nchose to be proficient with the warhammer. \nFinding himself in a desperate situation, he \nsnatches up a flail, even though he knows \nlittle about it (he is not proficient with it). \nUsing the weapon awkwardly, he has a -2 \npenalty to his chance to hit. \nInitid Namveapon Proficiencies is the \nnumber of nonweapon proficiency slots \nthat character has at 1st level. Even if you \nare playing with weapon proficiencies, non- \nweapon proficiencies are optional. \nTraining \nLike all skills and \nabilities, proficiencies do not leap unbidden \nand fully realized into a character's mind. \nInstead, a character must train, study, and \npractice to learn a new proficiency. How- \never, role-playing the training time needed \nto learn a new skill is not much fun. Thus \nthere are no training times or study periods \nassociated with any proficiency. When a \ncharacter chooses a proficiency, it is \nassumed that he had been studying it in his \nspare time. \nConsider just how much spare time the \ncharacter has. The player is not role-playing \nevery second of his character's life. The \nplayer may decide to have his character \nspend a night in town before setting out \n50 \non the long journey the next day. Perhaps \nthe character must wait around for several \ndays while his companions heal from the \nlast adventure. Or he might spend weeks on \nan uneventful ocean voyage. What is he \ndoing during that time? \nAmong ether things, he is studying what- \never new proficiencies he will eventually \nlearn. Using this \"down time\" to handle the \nunexciting aspects of a role-playing cam- \npaign lets players concentrate on more \nimportant (or more interesting) matters. \nAnother part of training is finding a \nteacher. Most skills are easier to learn if \nsomeone teaches the character. The DM can \nhandle this in several ways. For thost who \nlike simplicity, ignore the need for \nteachers-there are self-taught pepph eve- \nrywhere in the world. For those who want \nmore complexity, make the player charac- \nters find someone to teach them any new \nproficiency they want to learn. This can be \nanother player character or an NPC. \nAlthough this adds realism, it tends to limit \nthe PCs adventuring options, especially if \nhe is Muired to stay in reguiar contact with \nhis instructor. Furthermore, most teaches \nwant payment. While a barter arrangement \nmight be reached, the normal payment is \ncash. The actual cost of the service depends \non the nature of the skill, the amount of \ntraining desired, the availability of tutors, \nthe greed of the instructor, and the desire of \nthe DM to remove excess cash from his cam- \npaign. \nWeapon Proficiencies \nA weapon profi- \nciency measures a character's knowledge \nand training with a specific weapon. When \na character is created, the player checks \nTable 34 to see how many weapon profieien- \ncy slots the character has. These initial slots \nmust be filled immediately, before the char- \nacter embarks on his first adventure. Any \nslots that aren't filled by then are lost. \nEach weapon proficiency slot must be \nassigned to a particular weapon, not just a \nclass of weapons. Each weapon listed in \nTable 44 (Weapons) requires its own profi- \nciency; each has its own special tricks and \nquirks that must be mastered before the \nweapon can be handled propedy and &ec- \ntively. A fencer who is master of the epee, \nfor example, is not necessarily skilled with a \nsaber; the two weapons look similar, but the"
