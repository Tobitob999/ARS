When a \nspell's 'Gstiq Time\" parameter is given as \na number without any units (e.g., rounds or \nturns), then that number is added to the \ncastds initiative roll to determine his modi- \nfied initiati*. When a spell requires a round \nor more to cast, a nod initiative roll is \nnot made-a qkll requiring one round to \ncast takes efkct at the end of the current \nround, after all other actions are completed. \nSpeIls that require more tlun one mud \nto cast involve some bookkeeping. The DM \nor me of the players must keep track of the \nromds spent in casting. If the spellciasting \n&acts is disturbed during this time, the \nBpell is last. If all goes well, the spell takes \neffect at the very end of the last round of the \nrequind casting time. Thus, a spell requir- \ning 10 minutes to cast would reqire 10 \ncombat rounds, and wouldn't take effect \nuntil the very end of the 10th round. \nSince a rcutnd \nis not an Olympic sprinter nnnkrg in a \nstraight line.

His pMcipal weawn can be what- \never he chooses, provided it an be wielded \nwith one hand.
