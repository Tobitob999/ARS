If the initial check fails, no further \nattempts may be made, but the mount can \nmove normally. If the second or subsequent \ncheck fails, the mount immediately slows to \na walk, and the character must dismount \nand lead the animal for a turn. In any event, \nafter four turns of racing, the steed must be \nwalked by its dismounted rider for one turn. \n* The character can guide his mount with \nhisknees, enabling him to use weapons that \ntwo hands (such as bows and two- \nEzG swords) while mounted. This feat \ndoes not require a proficiency check unless \nthe character takes damage while so riding. \nIn this case, a check is required and failure \nmeans that the character falls to the ground \nand sustains an additional ld6 points of \ndamage. \n* The character can drop down and hang \nalongside the steed, using it as a shield \nagainst attack. The character cannot make \nan attack or wear armor while performing \nthis feat. The character’s Armor Class is \nlowered by 6 while this maneuver is per- \nforme+ Any attacks that would have struck \nthe character’s normal Armor Class are con- \nsidered to have struck the mount instead. \nNo proficiency check is required. \n* The character can leap from the back of \nhis steed to the ground and make a melee \nattack against any character or creature \nwithin 10 feet. The player must roll a suc- \ncessful proficiency check with a -4 penalty \nto succeed. On a failed roll, the character \nfails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to the \ngrpund, and suffers Id3 points of damage. \nRope Use: This proficiency enables a \ncharacter to accomplish amazing feats with \nrope. A character with rope use proficiency \nis familiar with all sorts of knots and can tie \nknots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly, or \nloosen with a quick tug. If the character’s \nhands are bound and held with a knot, he \ncan roll a proficiency check (with a -6 pen- \nalty) to escape the bonds. \nThis character gains a +2 bonus to all \nattacks made with a lasso. The character \nalso receives a +10 percent bonus to all \nclimbing checks made while he is using a \nrope, including attempts to belay (secure the \nend of a climbing rope) companions. \nRunning: The character can move at \ntwice his normal movement rate for a day. \nAt the end of the day he must sleep for eight \nhours. After the first day’s movement, the \ncharacter must roll a proficiency check for \nsuccess. If the die roll succeeds, the charac- \nter can continue his running movement the \nnext day. If the die roll fails, the character \ncannot use his running ability the next day. \nIf involved in a battle during a day he spent \nrunning, he suffers a -1 penalty to his \nattack rolls. \nSeaaunshlp: The character is familiar \nwith boats and ships. He is qualified to \nwork as a crewman, although he cannot \nactually navigate. Crews of trained seamen \nare necessaTy to manage any ship, and they \nimprove the movement rates of inland boats \nby 50 percent. \nSeamstdailor: The character can sew \nand design clothing. He can also do all kinds \nof embroidery and ornamental work. \nAlthough no proficiency check is required, \nthe character must have at least needle and \nthread to work. \nSet Snares: The character can make sim- \nple snares and traps, primarily to catch \nsmall game. These can include rope snares \nand spring traps. A proficiency check must \nbe rolled when the snare is first constructed \nand every time the snare is set. A failed pro- \nficiency check means the trap does not work \nfor some reason. It may be that the work- \nmanship was bad, the character left too \nmuch scent in the area, or he poorly con- \ncealed the finished work. The exact nature \nof the problem does not need to be known. \nThe character can also attempt to set traps \nand Snares for larger creatures: tiger pits \nand net snares, for example. A proficiency \ncheck must be rolled, this time with a -4 \npenalty to the ability score. In both cases, \nsetting a successful snare does not ensure \nthat it catches anything, only that the snare \nworks if triggered. The DM must decide if \nthe trap is triggered. \nThief characters (and only thieves) with \nthis proficiency can also attempt to rig man- \ntraps. These can involve such things as \ncrossbows, deadfalls, spiked springboards, \netc. The procedure is the same as that for \nsetting a large snare. The DM must deter- \nmine the amount of damage caused by a \nman-trap . \nSetting a small snare or trap t&es one \nhour of work. Setting a larger trap requires \ntwo to three people (only one need have the \nproficiency) and 2d4 hours of work, Setting \na man-trap requires one or more people \n(depending on its nature) and Id8 hours of \nwork. To prepare any trap, the character \nmust have appropriate materials on hand. \nCharacters with animal lore proficiency \ngain a +2 bonus to their ability score when \nattempting to set a snare for the purposes of \ncatching game. Their knowledge of animals \nand the woods serves them well for t& pur- \npose. They gain no benefit when attempting \nto trap monsters or intelligent beings. \nSinging: The character is an accom- \nplished singer and can use this ability to \nentertain others and perhaps earn a small \nliving (note that bards can do this automati- \ncally). No proficiency check is required to \nsing. The character can also create choral \nworks on a successful Proficiency check. \nSpellcrpft: Although this proficiency does \nnot grant the character any spellcasting \npowers, it does give him familiarity-with the \ndifferent forms and rites of spellcasting. If \nhe obse~es and overhears someone who is \ncasting a spell, or if he examines the material \n63 \ncomponents used, he can attempt to identify \nthe spell being cast. A proficiency check \nmust be rolIed to make a correct idartificp- \ntion. Wizard specialists spin a +3 bonus to \nthecheckwhenattemptingtoihtifynagic \nof their own school. Note that since the \nspellcaster must be observed until the my \ninstant of casting, the spellcraft proficiaq \ndoes not grant an advantage rrgsinst combat \nspells. The proficiency is quite useful, how- \never, for identifying spells that would other- \nwise have no visible effect. \nThose talented in this proficiency abp \nhave a chance (equal to 111 of their \nproficiency check) of recogniziq masiu) or \nmagicauy endowed constructs for what \nthey are. \nStonemuow A stonemason is able to \nbuild structures from stone so that they loet \nmany years. He cpn do simple stone UN- \nings, such as lettering, colum, and flow= \nishes. The stone can be mortared, caddy \nfitted without mortar, or loose#y fitted ad \nchinked with rocks and earth. A stonemas- \non equipped with his tools (hammers, \nchisels, wedges, blodc and tackle) caa buiki \na plain section of wd one foot thick, tcn \nfeet long, and five feet high in one day, pro- \nvided the stone has already bem cut. A \nstonemason m4 also supervise the work of \nunskilled laborers to quarry \nstonemason is needed for every \ners. Dwarves are among the most accom- \nplished stonemasons in the work& they \nreceive a +2 bonus when using this skill. ~ \nSurvival: This proficiency must be \napplied to a specific environment-i.e., a \nspecific type of terrain and weather factors. \nTypical environments include arctic, woo& \nland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. \nThe character has basic survival knowkdsp \nfor that terrain type. Additional proritioncy \nslots can be used to add more types of ter- \nrain. \nA character skilled in survival has a basic \nthat land. He understands the effects of the \nweather and knows the proper steps to \nlessen the risk of exposure. He knows the \nmethods to locate or gather drinkabie \nwater. He knows how to find basic, not nec- \nessarily appetizing, food where none is \napparent, thus staving off starvation. Fur- \nthermore, a character with sunrival skill can \ninstruct and aid others in the same situation. \nWhen using the proficiency to find food or \nwater, the character must roll a proficiency \ncheck. If the check is failed, no more \nattempts can be made that day. \nThe survival skill in no way releases the \nplayer characters from the hardship and \nhorrors of being lost in the wilderness. At \nbest it alleviates a small portion of the suf- \nfering. The food found is barely adequate, \nand water is, discovered in miniscule \namounts. It is still quite possible for a char- \nacter with survival knowledge to die in the \nf 1 \n‘ \nknowledge of the hazards hc might face in"
