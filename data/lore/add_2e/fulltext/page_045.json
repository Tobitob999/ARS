Once \ntheeffect wears off, it can't be renewed if the \npectpients are still in battle. However, \ntroops who have withdrawn from combat \ncan be reinspired by the bards words. A \ntroop of soldiers, inspired by Cwell, could \ncharge into battle. After fighting a fierce \nfight, they retreat and the enemy does not \npursue. Cwell, seeing them crestfallen and \ndispirited, once again rouses their will to \nfight. Reinvigorated, they charge back into \nbattle with renewed spirit. \nBards are also able to counter the effects \nof Dong and poetry used as magical at- \ntacks. Characters within 30 feet of the bard \nare immune to the attack as long as the bard \nsings a counter song (or recites a poem, \netc.). While doing this, the bard can per- \nform no other action except a slow walk. \nFurthermore, if he is struck or fails a saving \nthrow, his effort is ruined. Success is \nchecked by having the bard make a saving \nthrow vs. spell. Success blocks the attack, \nfailure means the attack has its normal ef- \nfect (everyone affected rolls saving throws, \nnormal damage is inflicted, etc.). The bard \ncan use this ability once per encounter or \nbattle. This power does not affect verbal \nspell components or command words; it is \nefkante against spells that involve explana- \ntions, commands, or suggestions. \nFinaUy, bar& learn a little bit of every- \nthg in their studies and travels. Thus all \nbards can read and write their native tongue \n(if a written language exists) and all know \nlocal history (without cost if the optional \nproficiency rules are used). Furthermore, \nbards have a 5 percent chance per experi- \nbel to identify the general purpose \nof any magical item. The bard \ndfe the item but must examine \nit closely. Even if successfu1, the exact func- \ntion of the item is not revealed, only its gen- \neral nature. \nSince CweIl the .Fint is 2nd level, he has a \n10 percent chance to know something about \na mpgical mrd +l. If he succeeds, he \ntherthewordiscursedand \nwas wd by the evil warrior Lurdas. I \nwouldn't touch it if I were youf\"). This ability \nit has an alignment (This word \ndoes not enable him to identify the sword's \nexact properties, only its history and badc- \nground. He has no idea of its bonuses or pen- \nalties or any special magical  pow^, accept \nas can be inferred from the histories. \n3eing something of a warrior, a bard can \nstronghold and attract followers \nreaching 9th level. The bard attracts \n-level soldiers into his mice. They \namve overa period of time, but they ue not \nautomatically replaced if lost in battle. Of \ncourse, a bard can build a stronghold any \ntime, but no followers arrive until he \nreaches 9th level. \nUpon reaching 10th level, a bard can at- \ntempt to use magical devices of written \nnature-scrolls, books, etc. However, his \nunderstanding of magic is imperfect (al- \nthough better than that of a thief), so there is \na 15% chance that any written item he uses \nis read incorrectly. When this happens, the \nmagical power works the opposite of what \nis intended, generally to the detriment of the \nbard or his friends. The DM will tell you \nwhat happens to your character, based on \nthe situation and particular magical item. \nThe result may be unpleasant, deadly, or \nembarrassing. (Deciding these things is part \nof the DMs funl) \nMulti-Class and \nDual-Class Characters \nA multi-class char- \nacter improves in two or more classes simui- \ntaneously. His experience is divided equally \nbetween each class. The available class com- \nbinations vary according to race. The char- \nacter can use the abilities of both classes at \nany time, with only a few restrictions. Only \ndemihumans can be multi-class characters. \nA dual-class character is one who starts \nwith a single class, advances to moderate \nlevel, and then changes to a second charac- \nter class and starts over again. The charac- \nter retains the benefits and abilities of the \nfirst class but never again earns experience \nfor using them. There are some limitations \non combining the abilities of the two classes \nbut, as long as minimum ability ad align- \nment requirements are met, there are no re- \nstrictions on the possible character class \ncombinations. Only humans can be dual- \nclass characters. \nMu@Class Combinations \nAll of the standard \ndemihuman races are listed here, along with \ntheir allowable mdti-ctass combinations. \nNote that the character class names (not \ngroup names) are used below. \nDwarf Halfling \nFighter/Thief Fighter/Thief \nFighter/ Cleric \nHalfelf \nElf Fightedcleric Fighter/Mage Fightu/~ \nFighterIThief \nMage/M Fighter/Mage/Thief Fiiter/Mage \nGnome Cleric/Ma& \nFighter/clctic T&f/Mage \nFighter/Illusionist Fighter/Mage/Ckric \nFighter /Thief Fi&ter/Mage/Thief \ncleric/Illusionist \nCleriC/rnef \nIllusionist/Thief \nAs stated earlier in thce description, spe- \ncialie wizards cannd be muIti-cIaSs \nillusionists are the \nrule). \nfield p \ning themselves to 0th dams. Wests of a \nspecific mythos might be allowed as a mu&- \nclass option; this will dqrrnd on the nature \nof the mythos as determined by the DM. \nMulti-Class Benefits \nacter always uses the most favorakk \nbat value and the best saving throw from his \ndifferent classes. \nThe character's hit points are the average \nof all his Hit Dice Pous. When the character \nis first created, the player rolls hit points for \neach class separately, totals them up, then \ndivides by the number of dice rolled (round \nfractions down). Any Constitution bonus is \nthen added to the character's hit Mints. If \none of the character's classes is fighter and \nhe has a Constitution of 17 or 18, theq~ he \ngains the +3 or +4 Constitution bonus \navailable only to warriors (instead of the \n+ 2 maximum available to the other charac- \nter classes). \nLater the character is likely to gain levels \nin different classes at difkent times. When \nthis happens, roll the appmpriate Hit Die \nand divide the result by the arprttWr of \nclasses the character has (round fracRibM \ndown, but a Hit Dit never yields less than 1 \nhit point).
