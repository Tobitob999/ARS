    "text": "Merchant's Scale: This is a small balance \nand pans along with a suitable assortment \nof weights. Its main use is to weigh coins- \na common method of settling a transac- \ntion. Merchants are well aware that coins \ncan be undersized, shaved, or plated. The \nonly sound protection is to check the coins \nagainst a set of established weights. It is \nalso needed when using foreign coins to \nmake a purchase or exchange. Of course, \nmerchants are no more noble than anyone \nelse and may use sets of false weights-one \nset heavier than normal for selling an item \n(causing the customer to pay more) and an- \nother set lighter than usual for buying \nitems (letting the merchant pay less). In \nwell-regulated areas, officials verify the ac- \ncuracy of weights and measures, but this in \nitself is no protection. Players may wish to \nhave a scale and weights for their own pro- \ntection. \nOil: Greek fire is a general name given to \nall My flammable oils used in combat. \n(Historically, Greek fire was a special com- \nbination of oil and chemicals that was sticky \nand difficult to extinguish.) These oils are \nhighly flammable and a little dangerous to \ncarry, Lamp oil is used for lamps and lan- \nterns. It is not particularly explosive al- \nthough it can be used to feed an existing \nblaze. \nSpyglass: Like the magnifying glass, the \nspyglass is more of an oddity than a useful \nitem. Objects viewed through it are a little \ncloser, although not much. For better re- \nsults, magical items are preferred. The spy- \nglass gives from two to three times \nmagnification . \nThieved Pkb This is a small collection \nof tools useful to burglars. The kit includes \none or more skeleton keys, long metal \npicks, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand \nsaw, and a small wedge and hammer. These \ncombined with some common tools (such as \na crowbar) make up most of the special \nequipment a thief needs to perform his \ntrade. \nWater Clock This bulky item is good for \ngiving the time accurate to a half-hour. Acti- \nvated by a regulated flow of drops, the wa- \nter clock is not something you carry in your \npocket. For it to work at all, it must have a \nsource of water and be left undisturbed! A \nvery uncommon item, it is primarily an \namusement for the wealthy and a tool for \nthe student of arcane lore. The vast major- \nity of society is not concerned with exact \ntime. \nWeapons \nThe Weapons Table \nlists more than just the price of each item. It \nalso gives other game information. Since \neach weapon is different, you should note \nthis information separately for each weapon \nvour character purchases or finds. \nWeapon Size All weapons are classed ac- \ncording to a size category-S, M, L, G, or \nH. Small (S) weapons are approximately \ntwo feet or less in size; medium (M) weap- \nons are two to five feet long; large (L) weap- \nons are generally six feet or greater in \nlength. Giant (G) and huge (H) weapons are \nnot found on the lists, since these are items \nnormally used by ogres, giants, and even \ngreater creatures. They are not items of \nequipment a PC can normally buy! \nA character can always wield a weapon \nequal to his own size or less. Normally this \nrequires only one hand, except for some \nmissile weapons (bows and crossbows in \nparticular). A character can also use a \nweapon one size greater than himself al- \nthough it must be gripped with two hands. \nBeyond this size limit, the weapon is not us- \nable without special means (most often \nmagical). \nDrelb the halfling (size S) can use a short \nsword with no difficulty (a size S weapon), \nor a long sword with two hands (a size M \nweapon), but a glaive (size L) is just too \nlarge for him to wield. Likewise, he can use \na short bow but is unable to handle a long \nbow. \nType: Weapons are classified according to \ntypes-bludgeoning (B), piercing (P), and \nslashing (S). These types are used to deter- \nmine armor type modifiers (if these are \nused). Weapons vs. Armor Type is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat (page 89). \nSpeed Factor: Weapon speed is a relative \nmeasure of the clumsiness of the weapon. \nThe lower the number, the quicker and eas- \nier the weapon is to use. Weapon speed is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat. \nDamage: All weapons are rated for the \namount of damage they can cause to small- \nand medium-sized creatures (S-M) and \nlarger-than-man-sized creatures (L). \nArquebus: This weapon may be disal- \nlowed by your DM and you must check \nwith him before you purchase it. An arque- \nbus is an early form of the musket, almost \nas dangerous to its user as it is to the target. \nTo use an arquebus, you must have a sup- \nply of powder and shot and a piece of slow- \nburning match or cord. These items may or \nmay not be commonly available. (Powder \nis treated as a magical item in these rules.) \nThe weapon can be fired only once every \nthree rounds, and then only if the character \nis not attacked while loading. When firing \nan arquebus, all penalties for range are \ndoubled. \nIf the attack roll for the arquebus is a 1 or \n2, the weapon backfires, causing ld6 points \nof damage to the firer. It is also fouled and \ncannot be used again until it has been \ncleaned, which takes about 30 minutes. \nWhen a arquebus scores a hit, it normally \ndoes 1 to 9 points of damage on ld10. When \na 10 is rolled, the die is rolled again and this \n73 \namount is added to 10. Each time a 10 is \nrolled, the die is rolled again and ded to \nthe previous total. Thus, in a rare indance, \na single shot could inflict 37 points, for ex- \nample, if three consecutive 10s were rolled, \nfollowed by a 7. The damage caused by an \narquebus is never modified for a high \nStrength score. \nBows: Bows come in various shapes and \nsizes. The power of a bow is measured by its \npull. The greater the pull, the more Strength \nneeded to work the bow. Thus it is possible \nhas a greater pull \nwith low Strengths \nties when using a bo \nweaker bows or sim \nbow-the bow of a strong hero may simply \nbe unstringable by a lesser man (as was \nodysseus's) . \ncharacters must roll a successful bend bars/ \nlift gates roll to string or use such weapans \n(again, think of the test uf the suitors in \nOdysseus's houkhold) . \nArrows for long bows of all types are di- \nvided between light-weight flight arrows \nCrossbow: Strength bonuses or penalties \ndo not apply to crossbows, since these are \npurely mechanical devices. The hand cmss- \ntype of horse or a greater one. A man on a \nlight war horse could not use a heavy home \nlance, if only because the impact would"
