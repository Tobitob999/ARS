The \ncaster is then able to call down bolts of light- \nning. The caster can call down one bolt per \nturn. The caster need not call a bolt of light- \nning immediately-other actions, even \nspellcasting, can be performed; however, \nthe caster must remain stationary and con- \ncentrate for a full round each time a bolt is \ncalled. The spell has a duration of one turn \nper caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points \nof electrical damage, plus an additional Id8 \npoints for each of the caster's experience \nlevels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a \n6d8 bolt (268 + 4d8). \nThe bolt of lightning flashes down in a \nvertical stroke at whatever distance the \nspellcaster decides, up to 360 yards away. \nAny creature within a 10-foot radius of the \npath or the point where the lightning strikes \nsuffers full damage unless a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell is rolled, in which case \nonly one-half damage is taken. \nBecause it requires a storm overhead, this \nspell can only be used outdoors. It does not \nfunction under ground or under water. \nContinual Light (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Sun \nRange: 12oyards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: *foot-radius globe \nsaving Throw: special \nThis spell is similar to a fight spell, except \nthat it is as bright as full daylight and lasts \nuntil negated by magical darkness or by a \ndispe2 mgic spell. Creatures with penalties \nin bright light suffer them in this spell's area \nof effect. As with the light spell, this can be \ncast into air, onto an object, or at a creature. \nIn the third case, the continual light affects \nthe space about one foot behind a creature \nthat successfully rolls its saving throw vs. \nspell (a failed saving throw means the con- \ntinual light is centered on the creature and \nmoves as it moves). Note that this spell as0 \nblinds a creature if it is successfully cast \nupon the creature's visual organs. If the spell \nis cast on a small object that is then placed in \na light-proof covering, the spell effects are \nblocked until the covering is removed. \nContinual light brought into an area of \nmagical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the \ndarkness so that the otherwise prevailing \nlight conditions exist in the overlapping \nareas of effect. A direct casting of a contin- \nuuf fight spell against a similar or weaker \nmagical darkness cancels both. \nThis spell eventually consumes the mate- \nrial it is cast upon, but the process takes far \nlonger than the time in a typical campaign. \nExtremely hard and expensive materials \nmight last hundreds or even thousands of \nyears. \nThe reverse spell, continual darkness, \ncauses complete absence of light (pitch \nblackness), similar to the darkness spell but \nof greater duration and area. \nCreate Food b Water (Alteration) \nSphere: Creation \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 cubic foot/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the priest causes \nfood and water to appear. The food thus \ncreated is highly nourishing if rather bland; \neach cubic foot of the material sustains three \nhuman-sized creatures or one homized \ncreature for a full day. The food decays and \nbecomes inedible within 24 hours, although \nit can be restored for another 24 hours by \ncasting a purify food and wuter spell upon \nit. The water created by this spell is the same \nas that created by the 1st-level priest spell \ncreate wuter. For each experience level the \npriest has attained, one cubic foot of food or \nwater is created by the spell. A 2nd-level \npriest could create one cubic foot of food \nand one cubic foot of water. \nCure Blindness or Deafness \n(Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Efkct: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy touching the creature afflicted, the \npriest employing the spell can permanently \ncure some forms of bli or deafness. \nThis spell does not restore or repair visual or \n209 \nauditory organs damaged by injury or dis- \nIts reverse, cuuse blindness or de+, \nrequires a successful touch (successful \nattack roll) on the victim.

A blind- \ned creature suffers a -4 penalty to its attack \nrolls, a + 4 penalty to its Annor Class, and a \n+2 penalty to its initiative rol \nCure Disease (Abjuration) \nReversible \nSpheld: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to cure most \ndiseases by placing his hand upon the dis- \neased creature. The affliction rapidly disap- \npears thereafter, making the cured creature \nwhole and well in from one turn to 10 days, \ndepending on the type of disease and the \nstate of its advancement when the cure took \nplace. (The DM must adjudicate these con- \nditions.) The spell is also effective against \nparasitic monsters such as green slime, rot \ngrubs, and others. When cast by a priest of \nat least 12th level, this spell cutes lycanthro- \npy if cast within three days of the infection. \nNote that the spell does not prevent reoccur- \nrence of a disease if the recipient is agair \nexposed. \nThe reverse of the cure disease spell is \ncuuse disease. To be effective, the priest \nmust touchthe inknded victim, and the vic- \ntim must fail a saving throw vs. spell, The \nseverity of the disease is decided by \npriest (debilitating or fatal). The \ndetails of the disease are decided by the DM, \nbut the following are typical: \nDebilitating-The disease takes effect in \nld6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 \npint of Strength per hour until his Strmgth \nis reduced to 2 or less, at which time the \nrecipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a \ncreature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% \nof its hit points per Strength loss, down to \n10% of its original hit points. If the disease \nalso affects hit points, use the more severe \npenalty. Recovery requires a period of ld3 \nWeeks. \nFutaf-This wasting disease is effeaive \nimmediately. Infected creatures receive no \nbenefit from cure wound spells while the \n'7 ... .- \n.. I... I \n.* .."
