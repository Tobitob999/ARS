The bonus or pen- \nalty is applied to the percentile dice roll the \nplayer must make when the character tries \nto learn a new spell (see Table 4). \n* Whenever a specialist reaches a new \nspell level, he automatically gains qne spell \nof his school to add to his spell books. This \nspell can be selected by the DM or he can \nallow the player to pick. No roll for learning \nthespell need bemade. It ir lsQumed that the \ncharacter hasdiscovered thianew spell dur- \ning the course of his resear& and study, \n* When a specialist wizard attempis to \ncreate a new spell (using the rules given in \nthe DMG), the DM should count the new \nIch other out. \nspell as one level less (for detenninhg tht \ndifficuhy)ifthespdlf&wi*theschgal \nofthespecialist. hr;eiwhanteratkmpti&to \ncreate a new enchantment spell wouki have \nan easier time of it than an illmionist \nattempting to do the same. \nIllusionist \nAbility Requinmthtrr: Dexterity 16 \nPrime Requisite: Intellipm \nRaces Allowed: Humul, Gnome \nThe illusionist is an exampk of a special- \nist. The baiption of the illusionist given \nhcvl be used as a -for crrptingwiz- \nardsspedalizing in oh magkal gdrools. \nFirst, the school of ilbion is a very \ndemanding field of study. To specialize as an \nillusionist, a wizard needs a Dexterity score \nof at least 16. \nh illusionist who has an Intelligence of \n16 or more gains a 10 percent bonus to the \nexperience points he eams. \nBecause the illusionist knows far more \nabout illusions thn the standard wizard, he \nis allowed a +1 bonus when rolling saving \nthrows against illudons: other characters \nsuffer a -1 penalty when rolling saving \nthrows against his illusions. (These modi- \nfiers apply oniy if the spell allows a saving \nthrow.) \nThrough th-e course of his studies, the illu- \nsionist has become &tat memorizing illu- \nsion BpeIls (though it is sa an arduous \nprocess). He can memorfze an extra illusion \nspell at each spell level. Thus as a lst-level \ncaster he can memorize two spells, although \natleastoneofthesemustbeanillusionspaH. \nLater, when hq begins to researdl new \nspells for his collection, he finds it easier to \ndevise new illusion spells to fill spcdalized \nneeds. Rese&~ in other schools is harder \nandmretimec-for him. \nFinally, the intense study of illusion magk \nprevents the character from mastering the \notherclassesof SpdletBPtare totally alien to \nthe illusion school (those diametrically \nopposite illusion on the diagram). Thus, the \nillusionist cannot learn spells from the \nschools of necromancy, invocation/evo- \ncation, or abj-wation. \nAs an example, consider Joinville the illu- \nsionist. He has an Intelligence score of 15. In \nthe CQUTS~ of his travels he captures an en- \nemy wizards spell book that contains an im- \nproved invisibility spell, a continual light \nspell, and a fireball spell, none of which are \nin Joinville's spell book. He has an 80 per- \ncent chance to learn the improved invisibil- \nity spell. Continual fight is an alteration \nspell, however, so his chance to learn it is \nonly 50 percent (consult Table 4 to see where \nthese figures come from). He cannot learn \nthe fireball spell, or even transcribe it into \nhis spell book, because it is an evocation \nspell. \n32 \nPriest \\ \nThe priest is a be- \nliever and advocate of a god from a particu- \nlar mythos. More then just a follower, he \ninterdes a& ac~ on beh;rlf of oth, \nseeking to use ?Ji powers to advance the \nbeliefsofhfemytfios. \nAll priests hve certain powers: The abil- \nity to cast speils, the strmgth of arm to \ndefend their be&&, pnd special, deity- \nwhib priests an not as fierce in combat as \ngrruntedpomrsto ekltheminthciralling. \nwaniors, they arc trained to weweapoxuy \nin the fight for their cause.
