    "text": "Wizard Spells (5th Level \n$L. \nAny creature we&ing less than 2,000 \npounds trying to push past it is slowed to 112 \nnormal movement. If the original opponent \nis slain, the caster can designate a new oppo- \nnent for the hand. The caster can command \nthe hand out of existence at any time. \nThe material component of the spell is a \n;oft glove. \nChaos (EnchantmentKhann) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Up to.40-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell is similar to the 4th-level confu- \nsion spell, but only the following beings \nreceive a saving throw: fighters, wizards \nspecialized in enchantments, monsters that \nuse no magic and have an Intelligence of 4 or \nless, creatures of 21 Intelligence or higher, \nand creatures with more levels or Hit Dice \nthan the caster's level. \nThe spell causes disorientation and severe \nperceptual distortion, creating indecision \nand the inability to take effective action. \nThe spell affects ld4 creatures, plus one \ncreature per caster level. Those allowed sav- \ning throws roll them vs. spell with -2 pen- \nalties, adjusted for Wisdom. Those who \nsuccessfully save are unaffected by the spell. \nAffected creatures react as follows: \nDIORoll Action \n1 Wander away (unless prevented) \nfor duration of spell \n2-6 Stand confused one round \n(then roll again) \n1-3 Attack nearest creature for one \nround (then roll again) \n10 Act normally for one round \n(then roll again) \nThe spell lasts one round for each level of \nthe caster. Those affected are checked by the \nDM for actions each round for the duration \nof the spell, or until the \"wander away for \nthe duration of the spell\" result occurs. \nWandering creatures move as far from the \ncaster as possible using their most typical \nmode of movement (characters walk, fish \nswim, bats fly, etc.). Saving throws and \nactions are checked at the beginning of each \nround. Any confused creature that is \nattacked perceives the attacker as an enemy \nand acts according to its basic nature. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall disc of bronze and a small rod of iron. \nCloudkill (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 40' wide, 20' high, \n20' deep cloud \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell generates a billowing cloud of \nghastly yellowish green vapors that is so \ntoxic as to slay any creature with fewer than \n4 + 1 Hit Dice, cause creatures with 4 + 1 to \n5 + 1 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poi- \nson with - 4 penalties or be slain, and crea- \ntures up to 6 Hit Dice (inclusive) to roll \nunmodified saving throws vs. poison or be \nslain. Holding one's breath has no effect on \nthe lethality of the spell. Those above 6th \nlevel (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud \nimmediately or suffer Id10 points of poison \ndamage each round while in the area of \neffect. \nThe cloudkill moves away from the spell- \ncaster at 10 feet per round, rolling along the \nsurface of the ground. A moderate breeze \ncauses it to alter course (roll for direction), \nbut it does not move back toward its caster. \nA strong wind breaks it up in four rounds, \nand a greater wind force prevents the use of \nthe spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse \nthe cloud in two rounds. As the vapors are \nheavier than air, they sink to the lowest \nlevel of the land, even pour down den or \nsinkhole openings; thus the spell is ideal for \nslaying nests of giant ants, for example. It \ncannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast \nunderwater. \nCone of Cold (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nWhen this spell is cast, it causes a cone- \nshaped area of extreme cold, originating at \nthe wizards hand and extending outward in \na cone five feet long and one foot in diame- \nter per level of the caster. It drains heat and \ncauses ld4 + 1 points of damage per level of \nexperience of the wizard. For example, a \n10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold \n10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing \n1Od4 + 10 points of damage. \nIts material component is a crystal or \nglass cone of very small size. \nConjure Elemental \n(Conjuration/Surnmoning) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThere are actually four spells in the con- \njure elemental spell. The wizard is able to \nconjure an air, earth, fire, or water elemen- \ntal with this spell-assuming he has the \nmaterial component for the particular ele- \nmental. (A considerable fire source must be \nin range to conjure a fire elemental; a large \namount of water must be available to con- \njure a water elemental.) Conjured elemen- \ntals have 8 Hit Dice. \nIt is possible to conjure up successive ele- \nmentals of different types if the spellcaster \nhas memorized two or more of these spells. \nThe type of elemental to be conjured must \nbe decided upon before memorizing the \nspell. Each type of elemental can be con- \njured only once per day. \nTheelemental conjured up must be con- \ntrolled by the wizard-the spellcaster must \nconcentrate on the elemental doing his \ncommands-or it turns on the wizard and \nattacks. The elemental will not break off a \ncombat to do so, but it will avoid creatures \nwhile seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is \nwounded or grappled, his concentration is \nbroken. There is always a 5% chance that \nthe elemental turns on its conjurer regard- \nless of concentration. This check is made at \nthe end of the second and each succeeding \nround. An elemental that breaks free of its \ncontrol can be dispelled by the caster, but \nthe chance of success is only 50%. The de- \nmental can be controlled up to 30 yards \naway per level of the spellcaster. The ele- \nmental remains until its form on this plane is \ndestroyed due to damage or until the spell's \nduration expires. Note that water elemen- \ntals are destroyed if they are ever morc thur \n50 yards from a large body of water. \nThe material component of the spell \n:besides the quantity of the element at hand) \nIS a small amount of one of the following: \n4ir Elemental-burning incense \nEarth Elemental-soft clay \nFire Elemental-sdphur and phosphorus \nWater Elemental-water and sand \nSpecial protection from uncontrolled ele- \nmentals is available by means of a protec- \ntion from mil spell. \n166"
