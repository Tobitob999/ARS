    "text": "Fire Storm (Evocation) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 160 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 2Sfoot cube/level, mini- \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nWhen a fire storm spell is cast, the whole \narea is shot through with sheets of roaring \nflame that equal a wall offire spell in effect. \nCreatures within the area of fire and 10 feet \nor less hom the edge of the affected area \nreceive 2d8 points of damage plus addition- \nal damage equal to the caster's level (2d8 + \nl/level). Geahtres that roll successful sav- \ning throws vs. spell suffer only one-half \ndamage. The damage is inflicted each round \nthe creat-we stays in the area of effect. The \narea of effect is equal to two 10' x 10' cubes \nper level of the caster-e.g., a 13th-level \ncaster can cast a fire storm measuring 130' x \n20' x 10'. The height of the storm is 10 or 20 \nfeet; the balance of its area must be in length \nand width. \nThe reverse spell, fire quench, smothers \ntwice the area of effect of a fire storm with \nrespect to normal fires, and the normal area \nof effect with respect to magical fires. Fire- \nbased creatures, such as elementals, sala- \nmanders, etc., of less than demigod status \nhave a a 5% chance per experience level of \nthe caster of being extinguished. If cast only \nagainst a flumetongue sword, the sword \nmust roll a successful saving throw vs. \ncrushing blow or be rendered nonmagical. \nSuch a sword in the possession of a creature \nfirst receives the creature's saving throw, \nand if this is successful, the second saving \nthrow is automatically successful. \nmum 16 1Gfoot cubes \nGate (Conjuration6ummoning) \nSphere: Summoning \nRange: Wyards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nSaving Throw: None \nCasting a gate spell has two effects: it \ncauses an interdimensional connection \nbetween the plane of existence the priest is in \nand the plane in which dwells a specific \nbeing of great power. The result of this con- \nnection is that the sought-after being can \nstep through the gate or portal, from its \nplane to that of the priest. Uttering the spell \nattracts the attention of the dweller on the \nother plane. When casting the spell, the \npriest must name the entity he desires to \nmake use of the gate and to come to his aid. \nArea of Effect: special \nThere is a 100% chance that something \nsteps through the gate. The actions of the \nbeing that comes through depemd on many \nfactors, including the alignment of the \npriest, the nature of those accompanying \nhim, and who or what opposes or threatens \nthe priest. Your DM will decide the exact \nresult of the spell, based on the creature \ncalled, the desires of the caster and the needs \nof the moment. The being gated in either \nreturns immediately or remains to take \naction. Casting this spell ages the priest five \nyears. \nHoly Word (ConjuratiodSurnmoning) \nReversible \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: %foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nUttering a holy word spell creates magic \nof tremendous power. It drives off evil crea- \ntures from other planes, fordng them to \nreturn to their own planes of existence, pro- \nvided the speaker is in his home plane. Crea- \ntures so banished cannot return for at least a \nday. The spell further affects creatures of \ndiffering alignment as shown on the follow- \ning table: \nRegenerate Ovecromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a regenerute spell is cast, body \nmembers (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, \nlegs, tails, or even the heads of multi-headed \ncreatures), bones, and organs grow back. \nThe process of regeneration requires but one \nround if the severed member(s) is (are) \npresent and touching the creahire, kl4 hvns \notherwise. The creature must be living to \nreceive the benefits of this spell. If the sev- \nered member is not present, or if the injury \nis older than one day per caster level, the \nrecipient must roll a successful system shock \ncheck to survive the spell. \nThe reverse, wither, causes the qmnk \nor organ touched to shrivel and cease func- \ntioning in one round, dropping off into dust \nin 2d4 turns. Creak- must be touched for \nthe harmful effect to occur. \nThe material components of this spell are \na prayer device and holy water (or unholy \nwater for the reverse). \nEffects of Holy Word \nCreature's \nHit Dice or Attack \nLevel General Move Dice speils Less than 4 Kills \n4 to 7+ Paralyzes ld4 turns \n8 to 11+ Slows 2d4 rounds -50% -4* \n12 or more Deafens ld4 rounds - 25 % -2 50% chance of failure \n- - - - - - - \nSlowed creatures attack only on even-numbered rounds until the effect wears off. \nAffected creatures are those within the \n30-foot-radius area of effect, which is cen- \ntered on the priest casting the spell. The side \neffects are negated for deafened or silenced \ncreatures, but such are still driven off if \nother-planar. \nThe reverse, unholy word, operates \nexactly the same way but affects creatures \nof good alignment. \nReincarnate (Necromancy) \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Person touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the priest can bring back a \ndead person in another body, if death \noccurred no more than one week before the \ncasting of the spell. Reincarnation does not \nrequire any saving throw, system shock, or \nresurrection survival roll. The corpse is \ntouched, and a new incarnation of the per- \nson appears in the area in ld6 turns. The \nperson reincarnated recalls the majority of \nhis former life and form, but the character \nclass, if any, of the new incarnation might"
