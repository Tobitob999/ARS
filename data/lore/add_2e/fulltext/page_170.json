He can opt to hold \none, two, three, or four creatures. If three or \nfour are attacked, each saving throw is nor- \nmal; if two are attacked, each saving throw \nsuffers a - 1 penalty; if only one is attacked, \nthe saving throw suffers a -3 penalty. \nThe material component for this spell is \none hard metal bar or rod for each monster \nto be held. The bar or rod can be as small as \na three-penny nail. \nLeomund’s Lamentable \nBelaborment (Enchantment, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures in a 10- \nfoot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis devious spell distracts the subject \ncreatures by drawing them into an absorb- \ning discussion on topics of interest to them. \nA chain of responses occurs during the next \n11 rounds, with additional saving throws as \ndescribed later. These responses are conver- \nsation (rounds 1-3), possible confusion \n(rounds 44, then either rage or lamenta- \ntion (rounds 7-11). All saving throws are \naffected by the creatures’ Intelligences, as \nnoted later. The subject creatures must be \nable to understand the language in which \nthe spellcaster speaks. \nUpon casting the spell, the wizard begins \ndiscussion of some topic germane to the \ncreature or creatures to be affected. Those \nmaking a successful saving throw vs. spell \nare unaffected. Affected creatures immedi- \nately begin to converse with the spellcaster, \nagreeing or disagreeing, all most politely. As \nlong as the spellcaster chooses, he can main- \ntain the spell by conversing with the sub- \nject(s). If the caster is attacked or otherwise \ndistracted, the subject creatures do not \nnotice. \nWizard Spells (5th Level) \nIntelligence Saving Throw Modifier \n2 or less \n3 to 7 -1 \n8 to 10 0’ \n11 to 14 +1 \nSpell has no effect \n15 or higher +2 \nThe wizard can leave at any time after the \ncasting and the subject($ continue on as if \nthe caster were still present. As long as they \nare not attacked, the creatures ignore all else \ngoing on around them, spending their time \ntalking and arguing to the exclusion of other \nactivities. However, when the caster leaves, \neach subject completes only the stage of the \nspell that it is currently in, and then the spell \nis broken. \nIf the caster maintains the spell for more \nthan three rounds, each affected creature \ncan roll another saving throw vs. spell. \nThose failing to save wander off in confu- \nsion for Id10 + 2 rounds, staying away \nfrom the spellcaster. Those who make this \nsaving throw continue to talk and roll sav- \ning throws each round the caster continues \nthe spell, up through the sixth round, to \navoid the confusion effect. \nIf the spell is maintained for more than six \nrounds, each subject must roll a successful \nsaving throw vs. spell to avoid going into a \nrage, attacking all other subjects of the spell \nwith intent to kill. This rage lasts for ld4 + 1 \nrounds. Those who successfully save \nagainst the rage effect realize that they have \nbeen deceived and collapse to the ground, \nlamenting their foolishness, for ld4 rounds \nunless attacked or otherwise disturbed. \nLeomund’s Secret Chest \n(Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning) \nRange: Special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 60 days \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 chest of about \n2‘ x 2’ x 3’size \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables a specially constructed \nchest to be hidden deep within the Ethereal \nplane, to be summoned using a small model \nof the chest. The large chest must be excep- \ntionally well-crafted and expensive, con- \nstructed for the caster by master craftsmen. \nIf made principally of wood, it must be ebo- \nny, rosewood, sandalwood, teak, or the \nlike, and all of its corner fittings, nails, and \nhardware must be platinum. If constructed \nof ivory, the metal fittings of the chest must \nbe gold. If the chest is fashioned from \nbronze, copper, or silver, its fittings must be \nelectrum or silver. The cost of such a chest is \nnever less than 5,000 gp. Once it is con- \nstructed, the wizard must have a tiny replica \n(of the same materials and perfect in every \ndetail) made, so that the miniature of the \nchest appears to be a perfect copy. One wiz- \nard can have but one pair of these chests at \nany given time-even wish spells do not \nallow exceptions! The chests themselves are \nnonmagical, and can be fitted with locks, \nwards, and so on just as any normal chest. \nWhile touching the chest and holding \ncauses the large chest to vanish into the \nEthereal plane. The chest can contain one \ncubic foot of material per level of the wizard \nno matter what its apparent size. Living \nmatter makes it 75% likely that the spell \nfails, so the chest is typically used for sear- \ning valuable spell books, magical items, \ngems, etc. As long as the spelkast \nsmall duplicate of the magical che \ntiny replica, the caster chants the spell. Tp \nrecall the large one from the Ethereal plane \nwhenever the chest is desired. If the minia- \nture of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is \nno way, not even a iish spell, that the large \nchest can return, although an ex \nmight be mounted to find it. \nthere is a 1% cumulative chance \nthat some being finds it. This chance is reset \nto 1 % whenever the chest is recalled and the \nspell recast to return it to the Ethereal plane. \nIf the chest is found, the DM must work out \nthe encounter and decide how the being \nreacts to the chest (for example, it might \nignore the chest, fully or partially empty it, \nor even exchange or add to the items \npresent!). \nWhenever the secret chest is brought back \nto the Prime Material plane, an ethereal \nwindow is opened and for a variable \namount of time, usually about one turn, \nslowly diminishes in size. When this hole \nopens between the planes, check for an ethe- \nreal encounter to see if a monster is drawn \nthrough. \nIf the large chest is not retrieved before \nthe spell duration lapses, there is a cumula- \nlost. \nMagic Jar (Necromancy) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Swcial \nWhile the chest is in the Ethereal \ntive chance of 5% per day t S \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe magic jar spell enables the \nshift his life force into a special rec - \ngem or large crystal). From there the caster \ncan force an exchange of life forces between \nthe receptacle and another creature, thus \nenabling the wizard to take over and control \nthe body of another creature, while the life \nforce of the host is confined in the recepta- \ncle. The special life force receptacle must be \nwithin spell range of the wizards body at \nthe time of spellcasting. The wizards life \nforce shifts into the receptacle in the round \n1 69"
