The wizard \nmust decide which effect is desired with \nregard to what creature type or alignment \nbefore beginning the spellcasting, for the \ncomponents of each application differ. The \nspell cannot be cast upon living creatures. \nAntiputhy: This spell causes the affected \ncreature or alignment type to feel an over- \npowering urge to leave the area or to not \ntouch the affected item. If a saving throw \nvs. spell is successful, the creature can stay \nin the area or touch the item, but the crea- \nture will feel very uncomfortable, and a per- \nsistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss \nof 1 point of Dexterity per round (for the \nspell's duration), subject to a maximum loss \nof 4 points and a minimum Dexterity of 3. \nFailure to save vs. spell forces the being to \nabandon the area or item, shunning it per- \nmanently and never willingly returning it \nuntil the spell is removed or expires. \nThe material component for this applica- \ntion of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in \nSympathy: By casting the sympathy \napplication of the spell, the wizard can \ncause a particular type of creature or align- \nment of character to feel elated and pleased \nto be in an area or touching or possessing an \n~ vinegar. \nr! ' \nobject or item. The desire to stay in the area \nor touch the object is overpowering. Unless \na saving throw vs. spell is successfully rolled \nthe creature or character will stay or refuse \nto release the object. If the saving throw is \nsuccessful, the creature or character is \nreleased from the enchantment, but a subse- \nquent saving throw must be made ld6 turns \nlater. If this saving throw fails, the affected \ncreature will return to the area or object. \nThe material components of this spell are \n1,OOO gp worth of crushed pearls and a drop \nof honey. \nNote that the particular type of creature \nto be affected must be named specifically, \ne.g., red dragons, hill giants, wererats, lam- \nmasu, catoblepas, vampires, etc. Likewise, \nthe specific alignment must be named, e.g., \nchaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful neutral, \ntrue neutral, etc. \nIf this spell is cast upon an area, a 10-foot \ncube can be enchanted per experience level \nof the caster. If an object or item is enchant- \ned, only that single thing can be enchanted; \naffected creatures or characters save vs. the \nspell with a -2 penalty. \nBigby's Ctenched Fist (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe Bigby's clenchedfist spell brings torth \na huge, disembodied hand that is balled into \na fist. This magical member is under the \nmental control of the spellcaster, who can \ncause it to strike one opponent each round. \nNo concentration is required once the spell \nis cast. The clenched fist never misses, but it \ncan only strike as directed by the caster. \nThus it can be fooled by invisibility or other \nmethods of concealment and misdirection. \nThe effectiveness of its blows varies from \nround to round. \nDZO \nRoll Result \n13-16 solid punch-2d6 hp \n17-19 hard punch-3d6 hp and opponent \nis stunned next round \n20 Crushing blow*-4d6 hp and \nopponent is stunned for next three \nrounds \n1-12 glancing blow-ld6 hp \nThe wizard adds +4 to the die rolls of \nsubsequent attacks if the opponent is \nstunned, as the opponent is not capable of \ndodging or defending against the attack \neffectively. \nThe fist has an Armor Class of 0, and is \ndestroyed by damage equal to the hit points \nof its caster at full health. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nleather glove and a small device consisting \nof four rings joined so as to form a slightly \ncurved lie, with an \"I\" upon which the bot- \ntoms of the rings rest, the whole fashioned \nof an alloy of copper and zinc. \nBinding (Enchantment, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nA binding spell creates a magical m#mht \nto hold a creature, usually from e \nplane of existence. Extra- dllrr \nmust be confined bv a CirrrJr \nactually uttered. The compr--kw \naccording to the form of the spel. bmt dwy \ninclude a continuous chanting mce \nread from the scroll or book page giving the \nspell; gestures appropriate to the form of \nbinding; and materials such as miniature \nchains of special metal (silver for lycan- \nthropes, etc.), soporific herbs of the rarest \nsort, a corundum or diamond gem of great \nsize (1,OOO gp value per Hit Die of the sub- \nject creature), and a vellum depiction or \ncarved statuette of the subject to be cap \ntured. \nMagic resistance applies unless the sub- \nject's true name is used. A saving throw is \nnot applicable as long as the experience level \nof the caster is at least twice as great as the \nHit Dice of the subject. The caster's level can \nbe augmented by one-third of the levels of \neach assisting wizard of 9th level or higher, \nand by one level for each assistant of 4th \nthrough 8th level. No more than six other \ner's level is less than twice the Hit Dice of the \nsubject, then the subject gains a saving \nthrow vs. spell, modified by the form of \nbinding being attempted. The various forms \nof binding are these: \nChaining: The subject is confined by \nrestraints that generate an untipathy affect- \ning all creatures who approach the subject, \nexcept the caster. Duration is as long as one \nyear per level of the caster(s). The subject of \nthis form of binding (as well as in the slum- \nber and bound slumber versions) remains \nwithin the restraining barrier. \nSlumber: Brings a comatose sleep upon \nthe subject for a duration of up to one year \nper level of the caster(s). \nBound Slumber: A combination of chain- \ning and slumber that lasts for up to one \nmonth per level of the caster(s). \nHedged Prison: The subject is transported \nto or otherwise brought within a confined \nwizards can dst with this ell.
