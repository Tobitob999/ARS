    "text": "Wizard Spells (8th level) \nMm Chum (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponent: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA mass charm spell affects either persons \nor monsters just as a charm person spell or a \n&arm monster spell. The mass charm spell, \nhowever, affects a number of creatures \nwhose combined levels of experience or Hit \nDice does not exceed twice the level of expe- \nrience of the spellcaster. All affected crea- \ntures must be within the spell range and \nwithin a 30-foot cube. Note that the crea- \ntures' saving throws are unaffected by the \nnumber of recipients (see the charm person \nand charm monster spells), but all target \ncreatures are subject to a penalty of -2 on \ntheir saving throws because of the efficiency \nand power of this spell. The Wisdom bonus \nagainst charm spells does apply. \nMaze (Conjuratiodiummoning) \nRange: 5 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nAn extradimensional space is brow.: into \nbeing upon utterance of a maze spell. The sub- \nject vanishes into the shifhng labyrinth of \nforce planes for a period of time that is totally \ndependent upon its Inwce. (Note: Mino- \ntaw are not affected by this spell.) \nIntelligence of \nMazed Creqture \nunder 3 \n3 to 5 \n6 to 8 \n9 to 11 \n12 to 14 \n15 to 17 \n18 and up \nTime Trapped \nin Maze \n2d4 turns \nld4 turns \n5d4 rounds \n4d4 rounds \n3d4 rounds \n2d4 rounds \nld4 rounds \nNote that teleport and dimension door \nspells will not help a character escape a \nmaze spell, although a plane shifting spell \nwill. \nMind Blank (Abjuration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 day \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the very powerful mind blank spell \nis cast, the creature is totally protected from \nall devices and spells that detect, influence, \nor read emotions or thoughts. This protects \nagainst augury, charm, command, confu- \nsion, divination, empathy (all forms), ESR \nfear feeblemind, mass suggestion, phantas- \nmal killer, possession, rulership, soul trap- \nping, suggestion, and telepathy. Cloaking \nprotection also extends to the prevention of \ndiscovery or information gathering by crys- \ntal balls or other scrying devices, clairaudi- \nence, clairvoyance, communing, contacting \nother planes, or wish-related methods \n(wish, limited wish). Of course, exceedingly \npowerful deities can penetrate the spell's \nbamer. \nMonster Summoning VI \n(ConjuratioiVSurnmoning) \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 7 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that it sum- \nmons ld3 6th-level monsters. These appear \nin Id3 rounds within the spell range and at- \ntack the caster's opponents, until either he \ncommands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale, and they \nvanish when slain. If no opponent exists to \nfight, summoned monsters can, if the wiz- \nard can communicate with them, and if they \nare physically capable, perform other serv- \nices for the summoning wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \nOtiluke's Telekinetic Sphere \n(Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: I-footdiameter sphere \nper level \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell is exactly the same as the 4th- \nlevel wizard spell, Otiluke's resilient sphere, \nwith the addition that the creatures or ob- \njects inside the globe are just about \nweightless-anything contained within it \nweighs only 1/16 of its normal weight. Any \nsubject weighing up to 5,000 pounds can be \ntelekinetically lifted in the sphere by the \ncaster. Range of control extends to a maxi- \nmum distance of 10 yarddlevel after the \nsphere has actually succeeded in encapsulat- \ning a subject or subjects. Note that even if \nmore than 5,000 pounds of weight is en- \nglobed, the perceived weight is but '/lS of \n. -190 \nactual, so the orb can be rolled without ex- \nceptional effort. Because of the reduced \nweight, rapid motion or falling within the \nfield of the sphere is relatively harmless to \nthe object therein, although it can be disas- \ntrous should the globe disappear when the \nsubject inside is high above a hard surface. \nThe caster can dismiss the effect with a \nword. \nIn addition to a hemispherical piece of di- \namond and a matching piece of gum arabic, \nthe caster must also have a pair of Oyy kr \nmagnets as material compm lor rlJI \nspell. \nOtto's Irresistible Dance \n(EnchantmenUChPnn) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: ld4 + 1 rounds \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched . , \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an OttoS irresistible dance spell is \nplaced upon a creature, the spell causes the \nrecipient to begin dancing, complete with \nfeet shuffling and tapping. This dance \nmakes it impossible for the victim to do any- \nthing other than caper and prance; this ca- \nvorting worsens the Armor Class of the \ncreature by -4, makes saving throws im- \npossible except on a roll of 20, and negates \nany consideration of a shield. Note that the \ncreature must be touched-as if melee com- \nbat were taking place and the spellcaster \nwere striking to do damage. \n,' t \nPermanency (Alteration) \nRange; Special \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell affects the duration of certain \nother spells, making the duration perma- \nnent. The personal spells upon which a per- \nmanency is known to be effective are as \nfollows: \ncomprehend \ndetect evil protection from \ndetect invisibility no& missiles \ndetect magic read magic \ninfrmision , tongues \nprotection from unseen servant \nprotection from evil ~ansuases \ncanttips \nThe wizard casts the desired spell and \nthen follows with the permanency spell. \nEach permanency spell lowers the wizards \nConstitution by 1 point. The wizard cannot \ncast these spells upon other creatures. This \n1 \ni \n1"
