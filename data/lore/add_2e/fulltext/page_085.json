    "text": "-- Magic (Priest Spells) \nU \nHowever, the limitations of each spell \nmust be considered when judging appropri- \nateness. A phantasmal force spell creates \nvision only. It does not provide sound, light, \nor heat. In the preceding situation, creating \na troop of soldiers galloping up behind you \nwould not have been believable. Where is \nthe thunder of hooves, the creak of saddle \nleather, the shouts of your allies, the clank \nof drawn metal, or the whinny of horses? \nOra may not be tremendously bright, but \nthey are not fooled that easily. Likewise, a \ndragon that suddenly appears without a \nthunderous roar and dragonish stench isn‘t \nlikely to be accepted as real. A wise spell- \ncaster always considers the limitations of his \nillusions and finds ways to hide their weak- \nnesses from the enemy. \nAn illusion spell, therefore, depends on \nits believability. Believability is determined \nby the situation and a saving throw. Under \nnormal circumstances, those observing the \nillusion are allowed a saving throw vs. spell \nif they actively disbelieve the illusion. For \nplayer characters, disbelieving is an action \nin itself and takes a round. For NPCs and \nmonsters, a normal saving throw is made if \nthe DM deems it appropriate. The DM can \ngive bonuses or penalties to this saving \nthrow as he thinks appropriate. If the caster \nhas cleverly prepared a realistic illusion, this \ncertainly results in penalties on the victim’s \nsaving throw. If the victim were to rely \nmore on mt than sight, on the other hand, \nit could gain bonuses to its saving throw. If \nthe saving throw is passed, the victim sees \nthe illusion for what it is. If the saving throw \nis failed, the victim believes the illusion. A \ngood indication of when player characters \nshould receive a positive modifier to their \nsaving throws is when they say they don’t \nbelieve what they see, especially if they can \ngive reasons why. \nThere are rare instances when the saving \nthrow may automatically succeed or fail. \nThere are times when the illusion created is \neither so perfect or so utterly fantastic as to \nbe impossible even in a fantasy world. Be \nwarned, these occasions are very rare and \nyou should not expect your characters to \nbenefit from them more than once or twide. \nIn many encounters, some party mem- \nbers will believe an illusion while others see \nit for what it really is. In these cases, reveal- \ning the truth to those deluded by the spell is \nnot a simple matter of telling them. The \nmagic of the spell has seized their minds. \nConsidered from their point of view, they \nsee a horrible monster (or whatever) while a \nfriend is telling them it isn’t real. They know \nmagic can affect people‘s minds, but whose \nmind has been affected in this case? At best, \nhaving an illusion pointed out grants \nanother saving throw with a +4 bonus. \nIllusions do have other limitations. The \ncaster must maintain a show of reality at all \ntimes when conducting an illusion. (If a \nsquad of low-level fighters is created, the \ncaster dictates their hits, misses, damage \ninflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth, \nand the referee decides whether the bounds \nof believability have been exceeded.) Main- \ntaining an illusion normally requires con- \ncentration on the part of the caster, \npreventing him from doing other things. \nDisturb him and the illusion vanishes. \nIllusions are spells of trickery and deceit, \nnot damage and destruction. Thus, illusions \ncannot be used to cause real damage. When \na creature is caught in the blast of an illu- \nsionary fireball or struck by the claws of an \nillusionary troll, he thinks he takes damage. \nThe DM should record the illusionary dam- \nage (but tell the player his character has tak- \nen real damage). If the character takes \nenough damage to ”die,” he collapses in a \nfaint. A system shock roll should be made \nfor the character. (His mind, believing the \ndamage to be real, may cause his body to. \ncease functioning!) If the character survives, \nhe regains consciousness after ld3 turns \nwith his illusionary damage healed. In most \ncases, the character quickly realizes that it \nwas all an illusion. \nWhen an illusion creates a situation of \ninescapable death, such as a giant block \ndropping from the ceiling, all thotie believ- \ning the illusion must roll for system shock. If \nthey fail, they die--killed by the sheer terror \nof the situation. If they pass, they are \nallowed a new saving throw with a +4 \nbonus. Those who pass recognize the illu- \nsion for what it is. Those who fail faint for \nld3 turns. \nIllusions do not enable characters to defy \nnormal physical laws. A illusionary bridge \ncannot support a character who steps on it, \neven if he believes the bridge is real. A illu- \nsionary wall does not actually cause a rock \nthrown at it to bounce off. However, affect- \ned creatures attempt to simulate the reality \nof what they see as much as possible. A \ncharacter who falls into an illusionary pit \ndrops to the ground as if he had fallen. A \ncharacter may lean against an illusionary \nwall, not realizihg that he isn’t actually put- \nting his weight on it. If the, same character \nwere suddenly pushed, he would find him- \nself falling through the very wall he thought \nwas solid! \nIllusions of creatures do not automati- \ncally behave like those creatures, nor do \nthey have those creatures’ powers. This \ndepends on the caster‘s ability and the vic- \ntim‘s knowledge of the creatures. Illusion- \nary creatures fight using the caster’s combat \nability. They take damage and die when \ntheir caster dictates it. An illusory orc could \ncontinue to fight, showing no damage, even \nafter it had been struck a hundred or a thou- \nsand times. Of course, long before this its \nattackers will become suspicious. Illusion- \nary creatures can have whatever special \nabilities the caster can make appear (i.e., a \n84 \ndragon‘s fiery breath or a troll’s regenera- \ntion), but they do not necessarily have \nunseen splrial abilities. There is no way a \ncaster can create the illusion of a basilisk’s \ngaze that huns people to stone. However, \nthese abilities might be manifested through \nthe fears of the victims. For example, Rath \nthe fighter meets an illusionary basilisk. \nRath has fought these beasties befare and \nknows what they can do. His gaze acciden- \ntally locks with that of the basilisk. Primed \nby his own kars, Rath must make a system \nshock roll to remain alive. But if Rath had \nnever seen a basilisk and had no idea that \nthe creature’s gaze could turn him to stone, \nthere is no way his mind could merate the \nfear necessary-to kill him. Sometimes igno- \nrance is bliss! \nPriest Spells \nThe spells of a \npriest, while sometimes having powers simi- \nlar to those of the wizard, are quite different \nin their overall tone. The priest’s role, more \noften than not, is as defender and guide for \nothers. Thus the majority of his spells work \nto aid others or provide some service to the \ncommunity in which he lives. Few of his \nspells are truly offensive, but many can be \nused cleverly to protect or defend. \nLike the wizard, the priest‘s level deter- \nmines how many spells he retains. He must \nselect these spells in advance, demonstrat- \ning his wisdom and far-sightedness by \nchoosing those spells he thinks will be most \nuseful in the trials that lurk ahead. \nUnlike the wizard, the priest needs no \nspell book and does not roll to see if he \nlearns spells. Priest spells are obtained in an \nentirely different manner. To obtain his \nspells, a priest must be faithful to the cause \nof his deity. If the priest feels confident in \nthis (and most do), he can pray for his \nspells. Through prayer, the priest humbly \nand politely requests those speIls he wishes \nto memorize. Under nod circumstances, \nthese spells are then granted. \nA priest‘s spell selection is limited by his \nlevel and by the different spheres of spells. \n(The spheres of influence, into which priest \nspells are divided, can be found on pages.) \nWithin the major spheres of his deity, a \npriest can use any spel1 of a given level when \nhe is able to cast spells of that level. Thus, a \ndruid is able to cast any 2nd-level plant \nsphere spells when he is able to cast 2nd- \nlevel spells. For spells belonging to the \nminor spheres of the priest’s deity, he can \ncast spells only up to 3rd level. The knowl- \nedge of what spells are available to the priest \nbecomes instantly clear as soon as he \nadvances in level. This, too, is bestowed by \nhis deity. \nPriests must pray to obtain spells, as they \nare requesting their abilities from some \ngreater power, be it their deity or some \n’ \nI"
