    "text": "Obviously, the stronghold must contain all \nthe trappings of a place of worship and must \nbe dedicated to the service of the cleric’s \ncause. However, the construction cost of the \nstronghold is half the normal price, since the \nwork has official sanction and much of the \nlabor is donated. The cleric can hold prop- \nerty and build a stronghold anytime before \nreaching 9th level, but this is done without \nchurch sanction and does not receive the \nbenefits described above. \nPriests of Speclflc Mytho \nIn the simplest ver- \nsion of the AD&D@ game, clerics serve reli- \ngions that can be generally described as \n“good” or ”evil.” Nothing more needs to be \nsaid about it; the game will play perfectly \nwell at this level. However, a DM who has \ntaken the time to create a detailed campaign \nworld has often spent some of that time de- \nvisiig elaborate pantheons, either unique \ncreations or adaptations from history or lit- \nerature. If the option is open (and only your \nDM can decide), you may want your char- \nacter to adhere to a particular mythos, tak- \ning advantage of the detail and color your \nDM has provided. If your character follows \na particular mythos, expect him to have \nabilities, spells, and restrictions different \nfrom the generic cleric. \nPriesthood in any mythos must be de- \nfined in five categories: requirements, \nweapons allowed, spells allowed, granted \npowers, and ethos. \nRequirements \nBefore a character can become a priest of \na particular mythos, certain requirements \nmust be met. These usually involve mini- \nmum ability scores and mandatory align- \nments. All priests, regardless of mythos, \nmust have Wisdom scores of at least 9. Be- \nyond this, your DM can set other require- \nments as needed. A god of battle, for \nexample, should require strong, healthy \npriests (13 Str, 12 Con). One whose sphere is \nart and beauty should demand high Wis- \ndom and Charisma (16 or better). Most dei- \nties demand a specific type of behavior from \ntheir followers, and this will dictate align- \nment choices. \nWeapons Allowed \nNot all mythoi are opposed to the shed- \nding of blood. Indeed, some require their \npriests to use swords, spears, or other spe- \ncific weapons. A war deity might allow his \npriests to fight with spears or swords. An \nagridtural deity might emphasize weapons \nderived from farm implements-sickles and \nbills, for example. A deity of peace and har- \nmony might grant only the simplest and \nleast harmful weapons-perhaps only las- \nsoes and nets. Given below are some sug- \ngested weapons, but many more are \npossible (the DM always has the final word \nin this matter). \nDeity Weapon \nAgriculture Bill, flail, sickle \nBlacksmith War hammer \nDeath Sickle \nDisease Scourge, whip \nEarth Pick \nHealing Mantatcher, quarterstaff \nHunt \nLightning Dart, javelin, spear \nLove Bow and arrows, \nman-catcher \nNature Club, scimitar, sickle . \nOceans Harpoon, spear, trident \nPeace Quarterstaff \nStrength Hammer \nThunder Club, mace, war hammer \nWar Battle axe, mace, morning \nstar, spear, sword \nWind Blowgun, dart \nBow and arrows, javelin, light \nlance, sling, spear \nOf course there are many other reasons a \ndeity might be associated with a particular \nweapon or group of weapons. These are of- \nten cultural, reflecting the weapons used by \nthe people of the area. There may be a par- \nticular legend associated with the deity, ty- \ning it to some powerful artifact weapon \n(Thor’s hammer, for example). The DM has \nthe final choice in all situations. \nSpells Allowed \nA priest of a particular mythos is allowed \nto cast spells from only a few, related \nspheres. The priest‘s deity will have major \nand minor accesses to certain spheres, and \nthis determines the spells available to the \npriest. (Each deity’s access to spheres is de- \ntermined by the DM as he creates the pan- \ntheon of his world.) The 16 spheres of \ninfluence are defined in the following para- \ngraphs. \nA priest whose deity grants major access \nto a sphere can choose from any spell within \nthat sphere (provided he is high enough in \nlevel to cast it), while one allowed only mi- \nnor access to the sphere is limited to spells of \n3rd level or below in that sphere. The com- \nbination of major and minor accesses to \nspheres results in a wide variation in the \nspells available to priests who worship dif- \nferent deities. \nAll refers to spells usable by any priest, \nregardless of mythos. There are no Powers \n(deities) of the Sphere of All. This group in- \ncludes spells the priest needs to perform ba- \nsic functions. \nAnimal spells are those that affect or alter \ncreatures. It does not include spells that af- \nfect people. Deities of nature and husbandry \ntypic;?ly operate in this sphere. \nAstral is a small sphere of spells that \nenable movement or communication be- \ntween the different planes of existence. The \n34 \nmasters of a plane or particularly meddle- \nsome Powers often grant spells from this \nsphere. \nCham spells are those that affect the atti- \ntudes and actions of people. Deities of Iwe, \nbeauty, trickery, and art often allow access \nto this sphere. \nCombat spells are those that can be used \nto directly attack or harm the enemies of the \npriest or his mythos. These are often \ngranted by deities of war or death. \nCreation spells enable the priest to \nduce somethvlg from nothing, often to \nefit his followers. This sphere can fill \ndifferent role, from a provider to a trk \nster. \nDivination enables the priest to \nsafest course of action in a particu \ntion, find a hidden item, or recover long- \nforgotten information, Deities of wisdom \nand knowledge typically have access to this \nsphere. \nElemental spells are all those that affect \nthe four basic elements of creation-earth, \nair, fire, and water. Nature deities, elemen- \ntal deities, those representing or protecting \nvarious crafts, and the deities of sailors \nwould all draw spells from this sphere. \nGuardian spells place magical sentries \nan item or person. These spells aremore \nI \n~ \nSummoning spells serve to call creatures \nfrom other places, or even other dimen- \nsions, to the service of the priest. Such serv- \nice is often against the will of the creature, \nso casting these spells often involves great \nrisk. Since creatures summoned often cause \n. \ni"
