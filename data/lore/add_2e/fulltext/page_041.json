Thieves can \natteinpt to remove these traps, but their \nchances of success are half their normal per- \ncentages. \nMove Silently: A thief can try to move si- \nlently at any time simply by announcing \nthat he intends to do so. While moving si- \nlently, the thief's movement rate is reduced \nto V3 normal. The DM rolls percentile dice \nto determine whether the thief is moving si- \nlently; the thief always thinks he is being \nquiet. Successful silent movement improves \nthe thiefs chance to surprise a victim, avoid \ndiscovery, or move into position to stab an \nenemy in the back. Obviously, a thief mov- \ning silently but in plain view of his enemies \nis wasting his time. \nHide in Shadows: A thief can try to disap- \npear into shadows or any other type of \nconcealment-bushes, curtains, crannies, \netc. A thief can hide this way only when no \none is looking at him; he remains hidden \nonly as long as he remains virtually motion- \nless. (The thief can,make small, slow, care- \nful movements: draw a weapon, uncork a \npotion, etc.) A thief can never become hid- \nden while a guard is watching him, no mat- \nter what his dice roll is-his position is \nobvious to the guard. However, trying to \nhide from a creature that is locked in battle \nwith another is possible, as the enemy's at- \ntention is fixed elsewhere. The DM rolls the \ndice and keeps the result secret, but the thief \nalways thinks he is hidden. \nHiding in shadows cannot be done in to- \ntal darkness, since the talent lies in fooling \nthe eye as much as in finding real conceal- \nment (camouflage, as it were). However, \nhidden characters are equally concealed to \nthose with or without infravisipn. Spells, \nmagical items, and special abilities that re- \nveal invisible objects can reveal the location \nof a hidden thief. \nDetect Nob A good thief pays attention \nto eirery detail, no matter how small, in- \ncluding faint sounds that most others miss. \nHis ability to hear tiny sounds (behind \nheavy doors, down long hallways, etc.) is \nmuch better than the ordinary person's. Lis- \ntening is not automatic; the thief must stand \nstill and concentrate on what he's hearing \nfor one round. He must have silence in his \nimmediate surroundings and must remove \nhis helmet or hat. Sounds filtering through \ndoors or other barriers are unclear at best. \nClimb Walls: Although everyone can \nclimb rocky cliffs and steep slopes, the thief \nis far superior to others in this ability. Not \nonly does he have a better climbing percent- \nage than other characters, he can also climb \nmost surfaces without tools, ropes, or \ndevices. Only the thief can climb smooth \nand very smooth surfaces without climbing \ngear. Of course, the thief is very limited in \nhis actions while climbing-he is unable to \nfight or effectively defend himself. \nRead Languages: Out of necessity, \nthieves tend to learn odd bits of informa- \ntion. Among these is the ability to read vari- \nous languages, particularly as they apply to \ntreasure maps, deeds, secret notes, and the \nlike. At 4th level, the thief has enough expo- \nsure to languages that he has a chance to \nread most nonmagical writing. This ability \nnaturally improves with more experience. \nHowever, your DM can rule that some lan- \nguages (those the thief has never encoun- \ntered) are indecipherable to the thief. \nThe die roll to read a language must be \nmade every time the character tries to read \na document (not just once per language). A \nsuccessful die roll means the thief puzzled \nout the meaning of the writing. His under- \nstanding of the document is roughly equal \nto his percentage chance for success: a 20 \npercent chance means that, if the thief un- \nderstands it at all, he gets about 20 percent \nof the meaning. A different document in \nthe same language requires another die roll \n(it probably contains different words). It \nisn't necessary to keep notes about what \nlanguages the thief has read in the past, \nsince each document is handled individu- \nally. \nOnly one die roll can bo made for any \nparticular document at a given experience \nlevel. If the die roll fails, the thief can try \nagain after gaining a new experience level. \nr knows how to read a \nThieves have other abilities not listed on \nTable 26: \nBackstab: Thieves are weak in toe-to-toe \nhacking matches, but they are masters of \nthe <knife in the back. When attacking some- \none by surprise and from behind, a thief can \nimprove his chance to successfully hit (+4 \nmodifier for rear attack and negate the tar- \nget's shield and Dexterity bonuses) and \ngreatly increase the amount of damage his \nblow causes. \nTo use this ability, the thief must be be- \nhind his victim and the victim must be un- \naware that the thief intends to attack him. \nIf an enemy sees the thief, hears him ap- \nproach from a blind side, or is warned by \nanother, he is not caught unaware, and the \nbackstab is handled like a normal attack \n(although bonuses for a rear attack still ap- \nply). Opponents in battle will often notice \na thief trying to maneuver behind them- \nthe first rule of fighting is to never turn \nyour back on an enemy! However, some- \n40 \none who isn't expecting to be attacked (a \nfriend or ally, perhaps) can be caught un- \naware even if he knows the thief is behind \nhim. \nThe multiplier given in Table 30,applies to \nthe amount of damage before modifiers for \nStrength or weapon bonuses are added. The \nweapon's standard damage is multiplied by \nthe value given in Table 30. Then strength \nand magical weapon bonuses are added. \nBackstabbing does have limitations. \nFirst, the damage multiplier applies only to \nthe first attack made by the thief, even if \nmultiple attacks are possible. Once a blow is \nstruck, the initial surprise effect is lost. Sec- \nond, the thief cannot use it on every crea- \nture. The victim must be generally \nhumanoid. Part of the skill comes from \nknowing just where to strike. 'A thief could \nbackstab an ogre, but he wouldn't be able to \ndo the sqme to a beholder. The victim must \nalso have a definable back (which leaves out \nmost slimes, jellies, oozes, and the like). Fi- \nnally, the thief has to be able to reach a sig- \nnificant target area. To backstab a giant, the \nthief would have to be standing on a ledge \nor window balcony. Backstabbing him in \nthe ankle just isn't going to be as effective. \nTable 30: BACKSW DAMAGE \nMULTIPLIERS \nThief's Level Damage Multiplier \n1-4 x2 \n5-8 x3 \n9-12 x4 \n13 + xs \nThe ogre marches down the hallway, \npeering into the gloom ahead. He fails to no- \ntice the shadowy form of Ragnar the thief \nhidden in an alcove. Slipping into the hall- \nway, Ragnar creeps up behind the monster. \nAs he sets himself to strike a mortal blow, \nhis foot scrapes across the stone. The hairy \nears of the ogre perk up. The beast whirls \naround, ruining Ragnark chance for a back- \nstab and what remains of his day. If 8agnar \nhad made a successful roll to move silently, \nhe could have attacked the ogre with & +4 \nbonus on his chance to hit and inflictad five \ntimes his normal damage (since he is 15th \nlevel). \nThieves' Cant: Thieves' cant is a special \nform of communication known by all \nthieves and their associates. It is not a dis- \ntinct language; it consists of slang words \nand implied meanings that can be worked \ninto any language. The vocabulary of \nthieves' cant limits its use to discussing \nthings that interest thieves: stolen loot, \neasymarks, breaking and entering, mug- , \nging, confidence games, and the like. It is \nnot a language, however. Two thieves can- \nnot communicate via thieves' cant unless \nthey know a common language. The cant is 1"
