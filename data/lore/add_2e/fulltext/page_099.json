    "text": "Punch: This is the type of blow landed. In \ngame terms, the type of blow has little \neffect, but using the names adds spice to the \nbattle and makes the DMs job of describing \nthe action easier. \nDamage: Bare-handed attacks cause only \n1 or 2 points of damage. Metal gauntlets, \nbrass knuckles, and the like cause ld3 \npoints of damage. A character's Strength \nbonus, if any, does apply to punching \nPunching damage is handled a little dif- \nferently than normal damage. Only 25% of \nthe damage caused by a bare-handed attack \nis normal damage. The remaining 75% is \ntemporary. For the sake of convenience, \nrecord punching damage separately from \nother damage and calculate the percentage \nsplit at the end of all combat. \nIf a character reaches 0 hit points due to \npunching attacks (or any combination of \npunching and normal attacks), he immedi- \nately falls unconscious. \nA character can voluntarily pull his \npunch, not causing any hit point damage, \n% K.O.: Although a punch does very lit- \ntle damage, there is a chance of knocking an \nopponent out. This chance is listed on the \ntable as \"% K.O.\" If this number or less is \nrolled on percentile dice, the victim is \nstunned for Idlo rounds. \nWrestle This lists the action or type of \ngrip the character managed to get. Wres- \ntling moves marked with an asterisk (*) are \nholds maintained from round to round, \nunless they are broken. A hold is broken by \na throw, a gouge, the assistance of another \nperson, or the successful use of a weapon. \n(Penalties to the attack roll apply to weapon \nattacks by a character who is in a hold.) \nAIl wrestling moves inflict 1 point of \ndamage plus Strength bonus (if the attacker \ndesires), while continued holds cause cumu- \nlatively 1 more point of damage for each \nround they are held. A head lock held for six \nrounds would inflict 21 points of damage \ntotal (1 +2 +3 + 4 + 5 + 6). Remember, this is \nthe equivalent of pressing hard on a full- \nnelson headlock for roughly six minutes! \nconcern is to pin \nThe defender also gains a benefit if it has \nmore than two legs: a -2 penalty to the \nattacker's roll for every leg beyond two. \nThere is no penalty to the defender if it has \nno legs. A lone OK: attempting to pull down \na horse and rider would have at least a -8 \npenalty applied to the attack roll (-4 for \nsize and -4 for the horse's four legs). \nIf the attack succeeds, the opponent is \npulled down. A character can be pinned if \nfurther successful overbearing attacks are \nrolled each round. For pinning purposes, do \nnot use the prone modifier to combat (from \nTable 51). \nIf multiple attackers are all attempting to \npull down a single target, make only one \nattack roll with a + 1 bonus for each attack- \ner beyond the first. Always use the to-hit \nnumber of the weakest attacker to figure the \nchance of success, since cooperation always \ndepends on the weakest link. Modifiers for \nsize should be figured for the largest attack- \ner of the group. \nA giant and three pixies attempting to \npull down a man would use the pixies' \nattack roll, modified by +3 for three extra \nattackers and +8 for the size difference of \nthe giant (Huge) and the man (Medium). \nWeapons in Non-Lethal Combat \nAs you mlght ex- \npect, weapons have their place in non-lethal \ncombat, whether a character is defending or \npressing the attack. \nWeapons in Defense: A character \nattempting to punch, wrestle, or overbear \nan armed opponent can do so only by plac- \ning himself at great risk. Making matters \nworse, an armed defender. is automatically \nallowed to strike with his weapon before the \nunarmed attack is made, regardless of the \ninitiative die roll. Furthermore, since his \nopponent must get very close, the defender \ngains a +4 bonus to his attack and damage \nrolls. If the attacker survives, he can then \nattempt his attack. \nThose involved in a wrestling bout are \nlimited to weapons of small size after the \nfirst round of combat-it's very difficult to \nuse a sword against someone who is twist- \ning your sword arm or clinging to your \nback, trying to break your neck. For this \nreason, nearly all characters will want to \ncarry a dagger or a knife. \nNon-Lethal Weapon Attacks It is possi- \nble to make an armed attack without caw- \ning serious damage (striking with the flat of \nthe blade, for example). This is not as easy \nas it sounds, however. \nFirst, the character must be using a weap- \non that enables him to control the damage \nhe inflicts. This is impossible with an arrow \nor sling. It isn't even feasible with a war \nhammer or mace. It can be done with \nswords and axes, as long as the blade can be \nturned so it doesn't cut. \n98 \nSecond, the character has a - 4 penalty to \nhis attack roll, since handling a weapon in \nthis way is clumsier than usual. The damage \nfrom such an attack is 50% normal; one- \nhalf of this damage is temporary. \nNon-Lethal Combat and Creatures \nWhen dealing with \nnon-humanoid opponents, a number of fac- \ntors must be considered. \nFirst, unintelligent creatures, as a rule, \nnever try to grapple, punch, or pull down \nan opponent. They cheerfully settle for tear- \ning him apart, limb by limb. This, to their \nsmall and animalistic minds, is a better solu- \ntion. \nSecond, the natural weapons of a creature \nare always usable. Unlike men with swords, \na lion or a carnivorous ape doesn't lose the \nuse of its teeth and fangs just because a char- \nacter is very close to it. \nFinally, and of greatest importance, crea- \ntures tend to be better natural fighters than \nhumans. All attacks for a tiger are the same \nas punching or wrestling. It's just that the \ntiger has claws! Furthermore, a tiger can use \nall of its legs effectively-front and back. \nTouch Spells and Combat \nMany spells used \nby priests and wizards take effect only when \nthe target is touched by the caster. Under \nnormal circumstances, this is no problem- \nthe spellcaster reaches out and touches the \nrecipient. However, if the target is unwill- \ning, or the spell is used in the midst of a gen- \neral melee, the situation is much different. \nUnwilling Targeta The spellcaster must \nmake a successful attack roll for the spell to \nhave any effect. The wizard or priest calcu- \nlates his to-hit number normally, according \nto the intended victim's Armor Class and \nother protections. The DM can modify the \nroll if the victim is unprepared for or \nunaware of the attack. If the roll succeeds, \nthe spellcaster touches the target and the \nnormal spell effect occurs. \nWiIling Targets: When attempting to cast \na spell on a willing target, the casting is \nautomatic as long as both characters are not \nengaged in combat. For example, if a fighter \nwithdraws from melee, a cleric could heal \nhim the next round. \nIf the recipient of the spell attempts to do \nanything besides waitirig for the spell to \ntake effect, an attack roll against AC 10 \nmust be made. However, no AC modifiers \nfor Dexterity are applied, since the target is \nnot trying to avbid the spell1 \nWhenever a touch spell is successful, the \nspellcaster suffers from any special defenses \nof his target, if they are continually in oper- \nation. A successful touch to a vampire \nwould not result in energy drain, since the \npower only works wh \n1 \ni"
