    "text": "Foreword to the Second Edition \nIt has been a long time getting here. I don’t mean the months, perhaps even years, you may \nhave waited for a revised, expanded, and improved 2nd Edition of the AD&D@ game. I mean \nthe long time it has taken me to reach this point, the writing of the foreword. Forewords are \nwritten last, so that you can summarize your feelings and experiences about the book you have \nwritten. \nIt’s not accurate to say this is a book that I alone have written. First off, there are a lot of \nother names listed in the credits. They, especially the editors, contributed time and talents that I \ndon’t have. Improving the organization and readability was one of the reasons we started this \nproject in the first place. These are tasks that can’t be done without talented editors who play \nand care about the game. If you discover that it‘s easier to find rules during your gaming \nsessions and that everything seems to make more sense, thank the editors. \nbeing without interested and involved players. The people who really decided what needed to be \ndone for the 2nd Edition are the players who mailed in questions, everyone who wrote an article \nfor DRAGON@ Magazine, and everyone who button-holed me (or other designers) at \nconventions. These were the people who decided what needed to be done, what needed fixing, \nwhat was unclear, and what they just didn’t like. I didn’t sit in a vacuum and make these \ndecisions. As the designer and developer, I had to make the final choice, but those choices were \nbased on your input. And your input is the most valuable asset we have going. \nSo how do I feel? Excited, exhausted, relieved, and nervous-all at once. It’s a great bag of \nemotions. I’m excited to see this book come out. I’ve spent more time on this than I have on any \nother single work I’ve done. That leads to exhaustion. The 2nd Edition has demanded and \nreceived hours upon months of attention. Now that it is finally coming out, the feeling of relief \nis beginning to set in. There were times when the task looked impossible, when it seemed it \nwould never end, or when everything was going wrong. Only now, when it’s in the final stages \nof polishing, am I beginning to realize that it really is done. And of course there is nervousness. \nThe AD&D game is the granddaddy of all role-playing games. You‘ve made it perfectly clear \nthat you liked the first edition of the AD&D game, even with all its warts. I liked (and still like) \nit. So, now with the arrival of 2nd Edition, of course I‘m nervous. \nNone of this comes as any surprise. I volunteered to prepare the 2nd Edition because I wanted \nto do something for the game I liked. The ten years of experience I’ve had in game design has \nshown me what works and what doesn‘t and sometimes even why. At the very start, we \noutlined the goals: to make it easier to find things, to make the rules easier to understand, to fix \nthe things that did not work, to add the best new ideas from the expansions and other sources, \nand, most important of all, to make sure the game was still the one you knew and enjoyed. Of \nthem all, the last was the hardest and most demanding, conflicting as it did with my basic desire \nto design things. Fortunately, things didn‘t rest on me alone. Lots of eager eyes, from those of \nfellow designers to those of enthusiastic playtesters, minutely examined this book and restrained \nme from overzealousness. It hasn’t always been easy to walk the fine line between ”not enough’’ \nand ”too much.” \nIn the past two years, I’ve talked to interested players many times, hearing their concerns and \nsharing my ideas. It was at the end of one of these talks (at a convention in Missoula, Montana), \njust as I described some rules change, that one of the listeners smiled and said, ”You know, \nwe‘ve been doing that for years.’’ And that is what the 2nd Edition is all about-collecting and \norganizing all those things that we, as players, have been doing for years. \nEven with the editors, this is not our work alone. None of this would ever have come into \nDavid “Zeb” Cook \nJanuary, 1989"
