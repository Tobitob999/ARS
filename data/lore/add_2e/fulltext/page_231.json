    "text": "1 A 1 \nPriest Spells (7th Level) \nI \nwood spell lasts for one round for each \nexperience level of the caster. \nThe waves of force continue to sweep \ndown the set path for the spell's duration, \npushing back wooden objects in the area of \neffect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. \nThe length of the path is 20 feet per level of \nthe caster, thus a 14th-level caster casts a \nturn wood spell with an area of effect 120 \nfeet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts \nfor 14 rounds. Note that after casting the \nspell, the path is set and the caster can then \ndo other things or go elsewhere without \naffecting the spell's power. \nWall of Thorns \n(Con jurationiSummoning) \nSphere: Plant, Creation \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: One 10-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThe wnll of thorn spell creates a barrier of \nvery tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing \nneedlesharp thorns as long as a person's fin- \nger. Any creature breaking through (or \ncrding into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 \npoints of damage, plus an additional amount \nof damage equal to the creature's AC. Nega- \ntive ACs subtract from the base 8 points of \ndamage, but no adjustment is made for Dex- \nterity. Any creature within the area of effect \nof the spell when it is cast crashes into the \nwall of thorn, and must break through to \nmove. The damage is based on each 10-foot \nthickness of the barrier. \nIf the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes \nat least four turns to cut a path through a 10- \nfoot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the \nbarrier, but magical fires bum away the bar- \nrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect \nwhile doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this \ncase, the cool side of the wall is that closest \nto the caster of the thorn wall. \nThe nearest edge of the wall of thorns \nappears up to 80 yards distant from the cast- \ner, as he desires. The spell lasts for one turn \nfor each level of experience of the caster, \ncovers one 10-foot cube per level of the cast- \ner in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus \na 14th-level caster could create a wall of \nthorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or \ndeep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot- \nhigh by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall \nto block a dungeon passage, or any other \nsort of shape that suited his needs. The cast- \ner can also create a wall of five-foot thick- \nness, which inflicts half damage but can be \ndoubled in one of the other dimensions. \nNote that those with the ability to pass \nthrough overgrown areas are not hindered \nby this barrier. The caster can dismiss the \nbarrier on command. \nWeather Summodng \n(Conjuration6ummoning) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 0 \nComponents: I?, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy this spell, the caster calls forth weather \nappropriate to the climate and Season of the \narea he is in at the time. Thus, in spring a \ntornado, thunderstorm, cold, sleet storm, \nor hot weather could be summoned. In sum- \nmer a torrential rain, heat wave, hail storm, \netc., can be called for. In autumn, hot or \ncold weather, fog, sleet, etc., could be sum- \nmoned. Winter enables great cold, blizzard, \nor thaw conditions to be summoned. \nHurricane-force winds can be summoned \nnear coastal regions in the late winter or ear- \nly spring. The summoned weather is not \nunder the control of the caster. It might last \nbut a single turn, in the case of a tornado, or \nfor hours or even days in other cases. The \narea of effect likewise varies from about one \nsquare mile to 100 square miles. Note that \nseveral casters can act in concert to greatly \naffect weather, controlling winds, and \nworking jointly to summon very extreme \nweather conditions. \nWithin four turns after the spell is cast, \nthe trend of the weather to come is \napparent-e.g., clearing skies, gusts of \nwarm or hot air, a chill breeze, overcast \nskies, etc. Summoned weather arrives \n1d12+5 turns after the spell is cast. Note \nthat the new weather condition cannot be \nchanged by the caster once it has been sum- \nmoned. Once the weather is fully summon- \ned, it cannot be dispelled. If the summoning \nis successfully dispelled before it has been \ncompleted, the weather slowly reverts to its \noriginal condition. \nWord of Recall (Alteration) \nSphere: Summoning \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe word of recall spell takes the priest \ninstantly back to his sanctuary when the \nword is uttered. The sanctuary must be spe- \ncifically designated in advance by the priest \nand must be a well-known place. The actual \npoint of arrival is a designated area no larg- \ner than 10' x 10'. The priest can bq trans- \nported any distance, from above or below \nground. Transportation by the word of \nrecall spell is safe within a plane, but for \neach plane the priest is removed, there is a \n230 \n10% cumulative chance that the priest is \nirrevocably lost. The priest is able to trans- \nport, in addition to himself, 25 pounds of \nweight per experience level. Thus, a 15th- \nlevel priest could transport his person and \nan additional 375 pounds weight. This extra \nmatter can be equipment, treasure, or even \nliving material, such as another person. \nExceeding this limit causes the spell to fail. \nNote that unusually strong physical fields \n(e.g., magnetic, gravitational) or magical \nforces can, at the DMs option, make the use \nof this spell hazardous or impossible. \nSeventhdevel Spells \nAnimate Rock (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Earth) \nRange: 40 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 2 cubic feet/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy employing an animate rock spell, the \ncaster causes a stone object of up to the indi- \ncated size to move (see the 6th-level mimate \nobject spell.) The animated stone object \nmust be separate (not a part of a huge bod- \nder or the like). It follows the desire of the \ncaster-attacking, breaking objects, block- \ning-while the magic lasts. It has no intelli- \ngence or volition of its own, but it follows \ninstructions exactly as spoken. Note that \nonly one set of instructions for one single \naction (the whole being simply worded and \nvery brief-12 words or so) can be given to \nthe animated rock. The rock remains ani- \nmated for one round per experience level of \nthe caster. The volume of rock that can be \nanimated is also based on the experience \nlevel of the caster-two cubic feet of stone \nper level-e.g., 24 cubic feet, a mass of \nabout man-sized, at 12th level. \nWhile the exact details of the animated \nrock are decided by the DM, its Armor \nClass is no worse than 5, and it has ld3 hit"
