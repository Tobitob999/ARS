An extremely large fire can be used \nas the source, and it is only partially extin- \nguished by the casting. Magical fires are not \nextinguished, although a fire-based creature \n(such as a fire elemental) used as a source \nsuffers ld4 points of damage, plus 1 point of \ndamage per caster level. This spell does not \nfunction under water. \nRemove Curse (Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nUpon casting this spell, the priest is usu- \nally able to remove a curse on an object, on \na person, or in the form of some undesired \nsending or evil presence. Note that the re- \nmoue curse spell does not remove the curse \nfrom a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of ar- \nmor, for example, although the spell typi- \ncally enables the person afflicted with any \nsuch cursed item to get rid of it. Certain spe- \ncial curses may not be countered by this \nspell, or may be countered only by a caster \nof a certain level or more. A caster of 12th \nlevel or more can cure lycanthropy with this \nspell by casting it on the animal form. The \nwere-creature receives a saving throw vs. \nspell and, if successful, the spell fails and the \npriest must gain a level before attempting \nthe remedy on this creature again. \nThe reverse of the spell is not permanent; \nthe bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for \nevery experience level of the priest using the \nspell. The curse can have one of the follow- \ning effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the \ntime it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 \n(the DM randomly determines which abil- \nity); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's \nattack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% \nof the time it makes the victim 50% likely to \ndrop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, \nin the case of creatures not using tools)- \nroll each round. \nIt is possible for a priest to devise his own \ncurse, and it should be similar in power to \nthose given here. Consult your DM. The \nsubject of a bestow curse spell must be \ntouched. If the victim is touched, a saving \nthrow is still applicable; if it is successful, \nthe effect is negated. The bestowed curse \ncannot be dispelled. \nRemove Paralysis (Abjuration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: ld4 creatures in a 20' cube \nSaving Throw: None \nBy the use of this spell, the priest can free \none or more creatures from the effects of \nany paralyzation or from related magic \n(such as a ghoul touch, or a hold or slow \nspell). If the spell is cast on one creature, the \nparalyzation is negated. If cast on two crea- \ntures, each receives another saving throw \nvs. the effect that afflicts it, with a +4 bo- \nnus. If cast on three or four creatures, each \nreceives another saving throw with a +2 \nbonus. There must be no physical or magi- \ncal bamer between the caster and the crea- \ntures to be affected, or the spell fails and is \nwasted. \nSnare (EnchantrnenKhann) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until triggered \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: 2' diameter circle plus V6' per \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to make a \nsnare that is 90% undetectable without \nmagical aid. The snare can be made from \nany supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When \nthe snare spell is cast upon it, the cord- \nlike object blends with its surroundings. \nOne end of the snare is tied in a loop that \ncontracts around one or more of the limbs \nof any creature stepping inside the circle \n(note that the head of a worm or snake \ncould be thus ensnared). \nIf a strong and supple tree is nearby, the \nsnare can be fastened to it. The magic of the \nspell causes the tree to bend and then \nstraighten when the loop is triggered, inflict- \ning ld6 points of damage to the creature \ntrapped, and lifting it off the ground by the \ntrapped member(s) (or strangling it if the \nheadheck triggered the snare). If no such \nsapling or tree is available, the cord-lie ob- \nject tightens upon the member(s), then \nwraps around the entire creature, causing \nno damage, but tightly binding it. Under \nwater, the cord coils back upon its anchor \npoint. The snare is magical, so for one hour \nit is breakable only by cloud giant or greater \nStrength (23); each hour thereafter, the \nsnare material loses magic so as to become 1 \npoint more breakable per hour-= after \ntwo hours, 21 after three, 20 after four- \nuntil six full hours have elapsed. At that \ntime, 18 Strength will break the bonds. Af- \nlevel of the spellcaster \nL A1 \nter 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of \nthe snare lose all magical properties and the \nloop opens, freeing anything it held. The \nsnare can be cut with any magical weapon, \nor with any edged weapon wielded with at \nleast a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for \nexample). \nThe caster must have a snake skin and a \npiece of sinew from a strong animal to \nweave into the cord-lie object from which \nhe will make the snare. Only the caster's \nholy symbol is otherwise needed. \n213"
