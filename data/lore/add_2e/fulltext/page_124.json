    "text": "c \nI Time and Movement (Climbing) \nOn particularly long climbs-those \ngreater than 100 feet or requiring more than \none turn (10 minutes) of climbing time-the \nDM may require additional checks. The fre- \nquency of these checks is for the DM to \ndecide. Characters who fail a check could \nfall a very long way, so it is wise to carry \nropes and tools. \nUlrblng Rates \nClimbing is differ- \nent from walking or any other type of \nmovement a character can do. The rate at \nwhich a character moves varies greatly with \nthe different types of walls and surfaces that \nmust be climbed. Refer to Table 67. Crossre \nference the type of surface to be climbed \nwith the surface condition. Multiply the \nappropriate number from the table by the \ncharacter's current movement rate. The \nresult is the rate of climb for the character, \nin feet per round, in any direction (up, \ndown,. or sideways). \nAll the movement rates given on Table 67 \nare for non-thief characters. Thief charac- \nters are able to climb at double the move- \nment rate for normal characters. \nRagnar the thief and his companion \nRupert (a half-elf) are climbing a cliff with \nrough ledges. A recent rain has left the sur- \nface slightly slippery. Ragnar has a moae- \nment rate of 12 and Rupert's is 8. Ragnar can \ncover 12 feet per round (12 x I since he is a \nthief), but Rupert stmggles along at the pace \nof4 feetper round (8 X 1/2). IfRagnarhad \ngone up first and lowered a rope to Rupert, \nthe half-elf could have climbed at the rate of \n8 feet per round using rope and wall (8 x I). \nTable 67: RATES OF CLIMBING \nSurface Condition \nType of Surface \nVery smooth \nSmooth, cracked \nRod \nSloping wall \nRope and wall \n3 \n2 \n2 1 \nv2 1 \n* Non-thief characters must be mountaineers and have appropriate tools (pitons, rope, \n** Thief characters can climb very smooth, slightly slippery surfaces at 1/4. \netc.) to climb these surfaces. \nEven thieves cannot climb very smooth, slippery surfaces. \nTypes of Surfacer \nVery smooth sur- \nfaces include expanses of smooth, uncrack- \ned rock, flush-fitted woaden walls, and \nwelded or bolted metal walls. Completely \nsmooth walls, unbroken by any feature, \ncannot be climbed by anyone without tools. \nSmooth and cracked walls include most \ntypes of well-built masonry, cavern walls, \nmaintained castle walls, and slightly eroded \ncliff faces. \nRough faces are most natural cliffs, poor- \nly maintained or badly built masonry, and \ntypical w& walls or stockades. Any \nnatural stone surface is a rough face. \nRough with ledges is similar to rough \nfaces but is dotted with grips three inches or \nmore wide. Frost-eroded cliffs and natural \nchimneys are in this category, as are mason- \nry buildings falling into ruin. \nIce walls are cliffs or faces made entirely \nof frozen ice. These are different from very \nsmooth and smooth surfaces in that there \nare still many natural cracks and protru- \nsions. They are extremely dangerous to \nclimb, so a Climbing check should be made \nevery round for any character attempting it \nwithout tools. \nTrees includes climbs with an open frame \nwork, such as a scaffold, as well as trees. \nSloping walls means not quite cliff-iike \nbut too steep to walk up. If a character falls \nwhile climbing a sloping wall, he suffers \ndamage only if he fails a saving throw vs. \npetrification. If the save is made, the charac- \nter slides a short distance but is not harmed. \nRope and wall require that the character \nuses a rope and is able to brace himself \nagainst a solid surface. \nActlonr Wle Ulablng \nAlthough it is pos- \nsible to perform other actions while climb- \ning, such as spellcasting or fighting, it is not \neasy. Spellcasters can use spells only if they \nare in a steady, braced position, perhaps \nwith the aid of other charactas. \nClimbing characters lose all Armor clpss \nbonuses for Dexterity and shield and most \noften have rear attack modifiers applied \nagainst them also. Their own attack, dam- \nage, and saving throw rolls & -2 penal- \nties. Those attacking from above gain a +2 \nbonus to their attack rolls, while thorc \nattacking from below suffer an additional \n-2 penalty to their athck rolls. A climbing"
