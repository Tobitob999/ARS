Note \nthat this does not affect either fuel consump- \ntion or damage caused by the fire. The \ncaster can affect any or all fires in the spell's \narea. He can alter their intensities with a sin- \ngle gesture as long as the spell is in effect. \nThe spell lasts until the caster cancels it, all \nfuel is burned, or the duration expires. The \ncaster can also extinguish all flames in the \narea, which expends the spell immediately. \nThe spell does not affect fire elementals or \nsimilar creatures. \nAlarm (Abjuration, Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 hours + V2 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Up to a 2Gfoot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an alarm spell is cast, the wizard \ncauses a selected area to react to the pres- \nence of any creature larger than a normal \nrat-anything larger than about one-half \ncubic foot in volume or more than about \nthree pounds in weight. The area of effect \ncan be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. \nAs soon as any creature enters the warded \narea, touches it, or otherwise contacts it \nwithout speaking a password established by \nthe caster, the ah spell lets out a loud \nringing that can be heard clearly within a \nafoot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet \nfor each interposing door and by 20 feet for \neach substantial interposing wall.) The \nsound lasts for one round and then ceases. \nEthereal or astrally projected creatures do \nnot trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating \ncreatures, invisible creatures, or incorpor- \neal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can \ndismiss the alarm with a single word. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver \n- endix 3: Wizard Spells \nArmor (Conjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard creates \na magical field of force that serves as if it \nwere scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has \nno effect on a person already armored or a \ncreature with Annor Class 6 or better. It is \nnot cumulative with the shield spell, but it is \ncumulative with Dexterity and, in the case \nof fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. \nThe armor spell does not hinder movement, \nadds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it \nprevent spellcasting. It lasts until success- \nfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains \ncumulative damage totaling greater than 8 \npoints +1 per level of the caster. (It is im- \nportant to note that the armor does not ab- \nsorb this damage. The armor merely grants \nan AC of 6: the wearer still suffers full dam- \nage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the \nwearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, \nthen several minutes later sustain an addi- \ntional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell \nwere cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, \nit would be dispelled at this time. Until it is \ndispelled, the amor spell grants the wearer \nfull benefits of the Armor Class gained. \nThe material component is a piece of \nfinely cured leather that has been blessed by \na priest. \nAudible Glamer (Illusion/Ph \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 roundsllevel \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Hearing range \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen the audibleglamer spell is cast, \nwizard causes a volume of sound to arise, \nat whatever distance he desires (within \nrange), and seem to recede, approach, or \nremain at a fixed place as desired. The vol- \nume of sound created, however, is directly \nrelated to the level of the spellcaster. The \nvolume is based upon the lowest level at \nwhich the spell can be cast, 1st level. The \nnoise of the audible glamer at this level is \nthat of four men, maximum. Each addi- \ntional experience level of the wizard adds a \nlike volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard \ncan have the spell cause sound equal to that \nof eight men. Thus, talking, singing, \nshouting, walking, marching, or running \nsounds can be created. The auditory illu- \nsion created by an audible glamer spell can \nbe virtually any type of sound, but the rel- \native volume must be commensurate with \nthe level of the wizard casting the spell. A \nhorde of rats running and squeaking is \nabout the same volume as eight men run- \nning and shouting. A roaring lion is equal \nto the noise volume of 16 men, while a \nroaring dragon is equal to the noise volume \nof no fewer than 24 men. \nA character stating that he does not be- \nlieve the sound receives a saving throw, and \nif it succeeds, the character then hears a \nfaint and obviously false sound, emanating \nfrom the caster's direction. Note that this \nspell can enhance the effectiveness of the \nphantusmal force spell. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of wool or a small lump of wax. \nI \nBurning Hands (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: 112 \nWhen the wizard casts this spell, a jet of \nsearing flame shoots from his fingertips. His \nhands must be held so as to send forth a fan- \nlike sheet of flames: the wizards thumbs \nmust touch each other and fingers must be \nspread. The burning hands send out flame \njets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of \nabout 120 degrees in front of the wizard. \nAny creature in the area of the flames suf- \nfers ld3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points \nfor each level of experience of the spell- \ncaster, to a maximum of Id3 + 20 points of \nfire damage. Those successfully saving vs. \nspell receive half damage. Flammable mate- \nrials touched by the fire bum (e.g., cloth, \npaper, parchment, thin wood, etc.). Such \nmaterials can be extinguished in the next \nround if no other action is taken. \nCantrip (All Schools) \nRange: 10 feet \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nCantrips are minor spells I idied by I \nards during their apprenticeship, regard \nof school. The cantrip spell is a practice \nmethod for the apprentice, teaching him \nhow to tap minute amounts of m+ \nenergy. Once cast, the canttip spell enables \nthe caster to create minor magical effects for \nthe duration of the spell. So minor are these \neffects that they have severe limitations. \nThey are completely unable to cause a loss \nof hit points, cannot affect the concentra- \ntion of spellcasters, and can only create \nsmall, obviously magical materials. Fur- \nthermore, materials created by a cantrip are \nextremely fragile and cannot be used --"
