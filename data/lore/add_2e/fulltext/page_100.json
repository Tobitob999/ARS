How \never, certain spells do specify specia \nconditions or durations. Be sure to checl \neach spell description carefully. \nMissile Weapons \nin Combat \nIn general, missilt \ncombat is handled identically to standarc \nmelee. Intentions are announced, initiativt \nis rolled, and attack rdls are made. How \never, there are some special rules and situa- \ntions that apply only to missile combat. \nMissile weapons are divided into two gen- \neral categories. The first includes all stand- \nard, direct-fire, single-target missiles \n-slings, arrows, quarrels, spears, throwing \naxes, and the like. \nThe second category includes all grenade- \nlike missiles that have an area effect, no \nmatter how small. Thus an attack with these \nweapons does not have to hit its target di- \nrectly to have a chance of affecting it. In- \ncluded in this group are small flasks of oil, \nacid, poison, holy water, potions, and boul- \nders. Hurled boulders are included because \nthey bounce and bound along after they hit, \nleaving a swath of destruction. \nto or less than the short-range distance,-the \ntarget is at short range. \nShort-range attacks suffer no range modi- \nfier. Medium-range attacks suffer a -2 pen- \nalty to the attack roll. Long-range attacks \nsuffer a - 5 penalty. Some weapons have no \nshort range since they must arc a certain dis- \ntance before reaching their target. These at- \ntacks are always made with an attack roll \npenalty. \n’ \nRate of Fire \nand many other missile weapons have dif- \nferent rates of fire (R0F)-the number of \nmissiles they can shoot in a single round. \nSmall, light weapons can be thrown very \n- Bows, crossbows, \nquickly, so up to three darts can be throw \nin a single round. Arrows can be nockec \nand let loose almost as quickly, so up to twc \nshots can be fired in a single round. \nSome weapons (such as heavy crossbows \ntake a long time to load and can be firec \nonly every other round. \nWhatever the ROF, multiple missile shot! \nare handled the same way as other multiplc \nattacks for the purposes of determining ini. \ntiative. The ROF of each missile weapon is \nlisted in table 45 in Chapter 6. \nAbility Modlflen - alle Combat \nAttack roll and dam- \ndamage modifiers for Strength are always \nused when an attack is made with a hurled \nweapon. Here the power of the character’s \narm is a significant factor in the effective- \nness of the attack. \nWhen using a bow, the attack roll and \ndamage Strength modifiers apply only if the \ncharacter has a properly prepared bow (see \nChapter 6: Money and Equipment). Char- \nacters never receive Strength bonuses when \nusing crossbows or similar mechanical de- \nvices. \nDexterity modifiers to the attack roll are \napplied when making a missile attack with a \nhand-held weapon. Thus, a character adds \nhis Dexterity modifier when using a bow, \ncrossbow, or axe but not when firing a tre- \nbuchet or other siege engine. \nFiring into a Melee \nMissile weapons \nare intended mainly as long-range weapons. \nIdeally, they are used before the opponents \nreach your line. However, ideal situations \nare all too rare, and characters often dis- \n:over that the only effective way to attack is \nio shoot arrows (or whatever) at an enemy \ndready in melee combat with their compan- \nons. While possible, and certainly allowed, \nhis is a risky proposition. \nWhen missiles are fired into a melee, the \nIM counts the number of figures in the im- \nnediate area of the intended target. Each \nviedium figure counts as 1. Small (S) figures \n:ount as V2, Large as 2, Huge as 4, and Gar- \n:antuan as 6. The total value is compared to \nhe value of each character or creature in the \narget melee. Using this ratio, the DM rolls a \nlie to determine who (or what) will be the \narget of the shot. \nFor example, Tarus Bloodheart (man-size, \nlr 1 point) and Ruth (ah0 man-sue, or 1 \nloint) are fighting a giant (size G, 6 points) \nJhile Thule fires a long bow at the giant. \n‘he total value of all possible targets is 8 \n5 +I +I). Therek a I in 8 chance that Ruth \ni the target; a 1 in 8 chance that Tam is hit; \nnd a 6 in 8 chance the shot hits the giant. \nThe DM could roll an 8-sided die to deter- \nmine who gets hit, or he could reduce the ra- \ntios to a percentage (75% chance the giant is \nhit, etc.) and roll percentile dice. \nTaking Cover Against Missile Fire \nOne of the best \nways to avoid being hit and injured is to \nhide behind something-a wall, a tree, a \nbuilding corner, a heap of boulders, or \nwhatever happens to be available. Profes- \nsional adventurers, wishing to make this \nsound heroic, call this taking cover. \nTaking cover doesn’t work particularly \nwell in a melee, since the cover hampers de- \nfender and attacker equally. However, it is \nquite an effective tactic against missile fire. \nThere are two types of protection a char- \nacter can have. The first is concealment, \nalso called soft cover. A character hiding be- \nhind a clump of bushes is concealed. He can \nbe seen, but only with difficulty, and it’s no \neasy task to determine exactly where he is. \nThe bushes cannot stop an arrow, but they \ndo make it less likely that the character is \nhit. Other types of concealment include cur- \ntains, tapestries, smoke, fog, and brambles. \nThe other type of protection is cover, \nsometimes called, more precisely, hard \ncover. It is, as its name implies, something a \ncharacter can hide behind that will block a \nmissile. Hard cover includes stone walls, the \ncomer of a building, tables, doors, earth \nembankments, tree trunks, and magical \nwalls of force. \nCover helps a potential target by giving \nthe attacker a negative modifier to his at- \ntack roll. The exact modifier for conceal- \nment or cover depends on the degree to \nwhich it is being used as shelter. A character \nwho stands behind a two-foot wall is a \nmtty obvious target, especially when.cm- \n3ared to the character who lies down behind \n.hat wall and carefully peers over it. Table \n59 lists the different mpdifiers for varying \niegrees of cover and concealment. \nrable 59: COVER AND CONCEALMENT \nrarget b: Cover Concealment \n!5 % hidden \nio % hidden \n’5 % hidden \n’0 % hidden \nMODIFIERS \n-2 -1 \n-4 -2 \n-7 -3 \n- 10 -4 \nCover also has an affect on saving \nhrows, granting the character the modifier \nisted on Table 59 as a bonus to his saving \nhrows against spells that cause physical \n‘amage (e.g., fireball, lightning bolt, etc.). \nFurthermore, a character who has m% \nover (or more) suffers one-half normal \namage on a failed save and no damage at \na saving throw is successful.
