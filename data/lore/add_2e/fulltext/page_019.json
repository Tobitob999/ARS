Here are just two different ways these \nnumbers could be interpreted. \n1) Although Rath is in good health (Con \n13), he’s not very strong (Str 8) because he‘s \njust plain lazy-he never wanted to exercise \nas a youth and now it’s too late. His low \nWisdom and Charisma scores (7, 6) show \nthat he lacks the common sense to apply \nhimself properly and projects a slothful, \nabove-average scores. There those “I’m not going to bother” attitude (which \ntends to irritate others). Fortunately, Raths \nnatural wit (Int 13) and Dexterity (14) keep \nhim from being a total loss. \nThus you might play Rath as an irritat- \ning, smart-alecky twerp forever ducking \njust out of range of those who want to \nsquash him. \n2) Rath has several good points-he has \nstudied hard (Int 13) and practiced his man- \nual skills (Dex 14). Unfortunately, his \nStrength is low (8) from a lack of exercise \n(all those hours spent reading books). \nDespite that, Raths health is still good (Con \n13). His low Wisdom and Charisma (7, 6) \nare a result of his lack of contact and \ninvolvement with people outside the realm \nof academics. \nLooking at the scores this way, you could \nplay Rath as a kindly, naive, and shy profes- \nsorial type who’s a good tinkerer, always \nfiddling with new ideas and inventions. \nObviously, Raths ability scores (often \ncalled ”stats”) are not the greatest in the \nworld. Yet it is possible to turn these ”disap- \npointing” stats into a character who is both \ninteresting and fun to play. Too often play- \ners become obsessed with “good stats. \nThese players immediately give up on a \ncharacter if he doesn’t have a majority of \nwho feel a character is hopeless if he does \nnot have at least one ability of 17 or higher! \nNeedless to say, these players would never \nconsider playing a character with an ability \nscore of 6 or 7. \nIn truth, Raths survivability has a lot less \nto do with his ability scores than with your \ndesire to role-play him. If you give up on \nhim, of course he won’t survive! But if you \ntake an interest in the character and role- \nplay him well, then even a character with \nthe lowest possible scores can present a fun, \nchallenging, and all-around exciting time. \nDoes he have a Charisma of 51 Why? May- \nbe he’s got an ugly scar. His table manners \ncould be atrocious. He might mean well but \nalways manage to say the wrong thing at the \nwrong time. He could be bluntly honest to \nthe point of rudeness, something not likely \nto endear him to most people. His Dexterity \nis a 31 Why? Is he naturally clumsy or blind \nas a bat? \nDon’t give up on a character just because \nhe has a low score. Instead, view it as an \nopportunity to role-play, to create a unique \nand entertaining personality in the game. \nNot only will you have fun creating that \npersonality, but other players and the DM \nwill have fun reacting to him. \nI"
