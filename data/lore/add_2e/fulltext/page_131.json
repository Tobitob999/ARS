How- \never, the same character would not receive a \nmving throw if the mage convinced him \nthat he was about to receive a levitation \nspell but cast a fireball instead. Your DM \nwill decide when NPCs have lowered their \nresistances. You must tell your DM when \nOUT character is lowering his resistance. \nSpell Description: The text provides a \nmplete description of how the spell func- \ntions and its game effects. It covers most \ntypical uses of the spell, if there are more \nthan one, but cannot deal with every possi- \nble application players might find. In these \ncases, the spell information in the text \nshould provide guidance on how to adjudi- \ncate the situation. \nSpells with multiple functions enable the \ncaster to select which function he wants to \nuse at the time of casting. Usually a single \nfunction of a multiple-function spell is \nweaker than a single-function spell of the \nsame level. \nSpell effects that give bonuses or penalties \nto abilities, attack rolls, damage rolls, sav- \ning throws, etc., are not usually cumulative \nwith each other or with other magic: the \nstrongest single effect applies. For example, \na fighter drinks a potion of giant strength \nand then receives the 2nd-level wizard spell \nstrength. Only the strongest magic (the po- \ntion) is effective. When the potion’s dura- \ntion ends, however, the strength spell is still \nin effect, until its duration also expires. \nAdjudicating Illusions \nAll illusions are \ncases of DM adjudication; each depends \nupon the exact situational factors deemed \nsqpificant by the DM. All of the following \npoints are only subsidiary guidelines to help \nthe DM maintain consistency. \nIntrinsically Deadly Illusions: ”Instant \nkill” illusions that are automatically fatal re- \ngardless of level, Hit Dice, or saving \nthrows: collapsing ceilings, inescapable \nlava pits, etc. The absolute maximum effect \nof these is to force a system shock check. \nSurviving characters are not further af- \nfected by that illusion. \nSpeg Effectr: Illusions that duplicate spell \neffects are keyed to the caster‘s level (e.g., a \nloth-level illusionist casting a fireball can \ncreate a convincing ladie fireball). Exceed- \ning this limit creates a fatal flaw in the illu- \nsion that negates its effect. \nMonster Special Attacks: Before the \ncaster can effectively duplicate a monster‘s \nspecial attack, the wizard must have under- \ngone it (a wizard cannot conjure up the \ntwinkle in a medusa‘s eye correctly without \nactually experiencing it-i.e., having been \nturned to stone by one). \nOption: Illusionary monsters attack us- \ning the wizards attack values. This would \nbe a subtle clue that the monsters are fake. \nOption: Extend the spell level control to \nmonsters-the caster can create monsters \nonly if the total monster Hit Dice are equal \nto or less than the caster’s level (an 8th-level \ncaster could convincingly do one hill giant, \ntwo ogres, or four 2nd-level fighters). \nIllusion spells require a higher degree of \nDM-player interaction than other wizard \nspells. The timing and staging of such spells \nby the caster are extremely important. Ef- \nfects that appear out of nowhere are not be- \nlieved unless the caster takes this into \naccount. On the other hand, an illusionary \nfireball cast after a wizard has cast a real one \ncould have devastating effects. \nThe caster must maintain a show of real- \nism at all times when conducting an illusion \n(if a squad of low-level fighters is created, \nthe caster dictates their hits, misses, damage \ninflicted, apparent wounds, and so forth; \nthe DM decides whether the bounds of be- \nlievability have been exceeded). \nNPC illusions require careful preparation \nby the DM, including clues to their nature. \nIntelligence is the best defense against illu- \nsions. Low and non-intelligent creatures are \nmore vulnerable to illusions, unless the illu- \nsion is completely outside their experience \nor the illusion touches on an area of the \ncreatures’ particular competence. Undcad \nare generally immune to illusions, but they \nare vulnerable to quasi-real effects, most of \nwhich start to appear in the 4th-level spell \nlist. \nIllusions usually cease to affect a charac- \nter if they are actively disbelieved. Disbelief \nmust be stated by the player, based on clues \nprovided by the DM. Players stating disbe- \nlief must give a reason for disbelief based on \nsensory information available to the charac- \nter. Failure to &e such a reason results in \nfailure to disbiieve. The DM can impose \nadditional requirements or delays in recog- \nnizing illusions (such as Intelligence checks) \nas needed, such as when one player is obvi- \nously parroting a discovery made by an- \nother. Disbelief automatically forfeits a \nsaving throw if the effect is real. \nFor NPCs, a saving throw, Intelligence \ncheck, or DM adjudication can be used to \ndetermine disbelief, whichever the DM \ndeems appropriate. \n130"
