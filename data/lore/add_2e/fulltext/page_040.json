Some \ncharacters may find that, after adjustments, \nthey have negative scores: In this case, the \ncharacter must spend points raising his skill \npercentage to at least 1% before he can use \nthe skill. (Some races just aren't very good \nat certain things!) \nA thief character uses the \"No Armor\" \ncolumn if wearing bracers of defense or a \ncloak without large or heavy protective \nclothing. \nSkill Explanations \nPick Pockets: The thief uses this skill \nwhen filching small items from other peo- \nples' pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc., \nwhen palming items (such as keys), and \nwhen performing simple sleight of hand. \nA failed attempt means the thief did not \nget an item, but it does not mean that his at- \ntempt was detected. To determine whether \nthe victim noticed the thief's indiscretion, \nsubtract three times the victim's level from \n100. If the thief's pick pockets roll was equal \nto or greater than this number, the attempt \nis detected. A 0th-level victim, for example, \nnotices the attempt only if the roll was 00 \n(loo), while a 13th-level character notices \nthe attempt on a dice roll of 61 or more. In \nsome cases, the attempt may succeed and be \nnoticed at the same time. \nIf the DM wishes, he can rule that a thief \nof higher level than his victim is less \nlikely to be caught pilfering. The chance \nthat the victim notices the attempt can be \nmodified by subtracting the victim's level \nfrom the thief's level, and then adding \nthis number to the percentage chance the \nTable 27: THIEVING SKILL RACIAL ADJUSTMENTS \nSkill \nPick Pockets \nOpen Locks \nDwarf Elf Gnome Half-elf HalfIing \n+lo% +5% \n+lo% -5% +5% - +5% \n- +5% - \nRead Languages \nTable 28: THIEVING SKILL DEXTERITY ADJUSTMENTS \nPick Open Findl Move Hide in \nDexterity Pockets Locks Remove Traps Silently Shadows \n9 -15% -10% -10% -20% - 10% \n10 -10% -5% -10% -15% -5% \n11 -5% - -5% -10% - \n17 +5% + 10% - +5% +S?h - .- .. \n18 +lo% +15% +5% +lo% +lo% \n19 +15% +20% + 10% +15% +15% \nTable 29 THIEVING SKILL ARMOR ADJUSTMENTS \nSkill \nPick Pockets \nOpen Locks \nPadded or \nNo Armor Elven Chain' Studded Leather \n+5% -20% -30% \n-5% -10% - \nFind/Remove Tram \n- - Read Languages - \nBards (only) in non-elven chain mail suffer an additional -5% penalty. \n39 \nected. For example, Ragnar, a \n15th-level thief, tries to pick the pocket \nof Horace, a 9th-level fighter. Normally, \nRagnar would be detected if his pick \npockets roll was 73 or more (100-[3 x 91 \n= 73). Using this optional system, since \nRagnar is six levels higher than Horace, \nthis number is increased by six to 79 (73 \n+ 6 = 79). This option onlv applies if \nA thief can try to pick someone's pocket \nas many times as he wants. Neither failure \nnor success prevents additional attempts, \nbut getting caught might! \nOpen Locks: A thief can try to pick pad- \nlocks, finesse combination locks (if they ex- \nist), and solve puzzle locks (locks with \nsliding panels, hidden releases, and con- \ncealed keyholes). Picking a padlock requires \ntools. Using typical thief's tools grants nor- \nmal chances for success. Using improvised \ntools (a bit of wire, a thin dirk, a stick, etc.) \nimposes a penalty on the character's chance \nfor success. The DM sets the penalty based \non the situation; penalties can range from \n-5 for an improvised but suitable tool, to \n-60 for an awkward ar;l .unsuitable item \n(like a stick). The amount bf time required \nto pick a lock is Id10 rounds. A thief can try \nto pick a particular lock only once per expe- \nrience level. If the attempt fails, the lock is \nsimply too difficult for the character until he \nlearns more about picking locks (goes up a \nlevel). \nFinaRemove Traps: The thief is trained \nto find small traps and alarms. These in- \nclude poisoned needles, spring blades, \ndeadly gases, and warning bells. This skill is \nnot effective for finding deadfall ceilings, \ncrushing walls, or other large, mechanical \ntraps. \nTo find the trap, the thief must be able to \ntouch and inspect the trapped object. Nor- \nmally, the DM rolls the dice to determine \nwhether the thief finds a trap. If the DM \nsays, \"You didn't find any traps,\" it's up to \nthe player to decide whether that means \nthere are no traps or there are traps but the \nthief didn't see them. If the thief finds a trap, \nhe knows its general principle but not its ex- \nact nature. A thief can check an item for \ntraps once per experience level. Searching \nfor a trap takes Id10 rounds. \nOnce a trap is found, the thief can try to \nremove it or disarm it. This also requires \nIdlo rounds. If the dice roll indicates suc- \ncess, the trap is disarmed. If the dice roll \nindicates failure, the trap is beyond the \nthief's current skill. He can try disarming the \ntrap again when he advances to the next ex- \nperience level. If the dice roll is 96-100, the \nthief accidentally triggers the trap and suf- \nfers the consequences. Sometimes (usually \nbecause his percentages are low) a thief will \ndeliberately spring a trap rather than"
