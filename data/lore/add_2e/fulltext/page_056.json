If the task is simple \nor the proficiency has only limited game use \n(such as cobbling or carpentry), a profi- \nciency check is generally not required. If the \ntask the character is trying to perform is dif- \nficult or subject to failure, a proficiency \ncheck is required. Read the descriptions of \nthe proficiencies for details about how and \nwhen each can be used. \n55 \nIf a proficiency check is required, Table 37 \nlists which ability is used with each profi- \nciency. Add the modifier (either positive or \nnegative) listed in Table 37 to the appropri- \nate ability score. Then the player rolls ld20. \nIf the roll is equal to or less than the charac- \nter’s adjusted ability score, the character ac- \ncomplished what he was trying to do. If the \nroll is greater than the character’s ability \nscore, the character fails at the task. (A roll \nof 20 always fails.) The DM determines \nwhat effects, if any, accompany failure. \nOf course, to use a proficiency, the char- \nacter must have any tools and materials \nneeded to do the job. A carpenter can do \nvery little without his tools, and a smith is \nvirtually helpless without a good forge. The \ncharacter must also have enough time to do \nthe job. Certainly, carpentry proficiency en- \nables your character to build a house, but \nnot in a single day1 Some proficiency de- \nscriptions state how much time is requid \nfor certain jobs. Most, however, are left to \nthe DMs judgment. \nThe DM can raise or lower a character’s \nchance of success if the situation calls for \nit. Factors that can affect a proficiency \ncheck inclwde availability and quality of \ntools, quality of raw material used, time \nspent doing the job, difficulty of the job, \nand how familiar the character is with the \ntask. A positive modifier is added to the \nability score used for the check. A negative \nmodifier is subtracted from the ability \nscore. \nRath, skilled as a blacksmith, has been \nmaking horseshoes for years. Because he is \nso familiar with the task and has every tool \nhe needs, the DM lets him make ho~ocs \nautomatically, without risk of failure. How- \never, Delsenora has persuaded Rath to make \nan elaborate wrought-iron cage (she needs it \nto create a magical item). Rath has never \ndone this before and the work is very intri- \ncate, so the DM imposes a penalty of - 3 on \nRaths ability check. \nWhen two proficient cheers work to- \ngether on the same task, the highest ability \nscore is used (the one with the greatest \nchance of success). Furthermore, a +1 bo- \nnus is added for the other character’s assist- \nance. The bonus can never be more than \n+ 1, as having too many assistants is some- \ntimes worse than having none. \nNonweapon proficiencies can also be im- \nproved beyond the ability score the charac- \nter starts with. For every additional \nproficiency slot a character spends on a \nnonweapon proficiency, he gains a +1 bo- \nnus to those proficiency checks. Thus, Rath \n(were he not an adventurer) might spend his \nadditional proficiency slots on blacksmith- \ning, to become a very good blacksmith, \ngaining a +1, +2, +3, or greater bonus to \nhis ability checks. \nMany non-player craftsmen are more ac- \ncomplished in their fields than player"
