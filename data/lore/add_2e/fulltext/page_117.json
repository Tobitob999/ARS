    "text": "i \nI NPCs (Player Character Obligations) I \na means to get at the player character. \nThroughout history, many a cruel and cun- \nning villain has posed as a true companion, \nwaiting his chance to strike or spy on his \nfriend. \nPlayer Character \nObligations \nWhenev \ncharacter takes on a hireling, follower, or \nhenchman, he has committed himself to cer- \ntain obligations and customs that surround \nsuch agreements. Some of these are obvi- \nous, having been worked out between the \nplayer character and the NPC in advance. \nUsually the wage and term of service are set- \ntled upon before any agreement is reached. \nFor hirelings and followers, this is a set \namount of money each day, week, or \nmonth, or a fee for a specific task. Hench- \nmen commonly receive a portion (1/z a nor- \nmal share) of all treasure and magic found \non adventures. A player character is nor- \nmally expected to contribute a little more \nfrom his own funds, however. \nOther obligations of the player character \nare varied. Some must always be consid- \nered, while others almost never come into \neffect. A player character is expected to pro- \nvide meals and boarding (unless the NPC \nhas a home nearby). This is the most com- \nmon obligation and applies to NPCs of all \nwalks of life. For those engaged in more \ndangerous pursuits, however, additional \nconcessions must be granted. Since horses \nare expensive, player characters should be \nready to cover the cost of mounts lost in \ncombat or on campaign. It is unreasonable \nto expect a mercenary to buy a new mount \nfrom his meager savings. Likewise, other \nitems of war craft-weapons and armor- \nmust be replaced by the player character. \nAll soldiers are expected to provide their \nown equipment when they are first \nemployed, but the player character must \nreplace all losses. Certainly all player char- \nacters are expected to pay the cost of special \ntransport--securing passage on ships and \narranging wagons for baggage. Of the grim- \nmer duties, player characters are expected \nto pay for a decent (though hardly lavish) \ninterment. \nOne of the more unusual obligations of a \nplayer character is to ransom his men. This \nis especially true of men lost during a cam- \npaign. The greater number of soldiers lost in \na battle are not slain but captured. Common \npractice of the medieval period was to offi- \ncially ransom these prisoners for well- \nestablished prices. A common yeoman \nfootman might ransom for 2 gp, a minor \npriest for 80 gp, a knight's squire for 200 gp, \nand a king's man for 500 gp. These are paid \nfor by the lord of the prisoner. A player \ncharacter (as a lord and master) is expected \nto do the same. Of course, the player char- \nacter can pass much of this cost on to his \nown subjects and the relatives of the pris- \noner. Thus men might languish for long per- \niods in the hands of the enemy before their \nransom was raised. Furthermore, should a \nplayer character ransom a hireling, fol- \nlower, or henchman, he has every reason to \nexpect loyal service from that man in the \nfuture. After all, he has demonstrated his \nwillingness to save that NPC from hardship \nand death. \nIn a fantasy world, a player character is \nalso expected to bear the cost of magical \nspells cast to the benefit of his men. He may \narrange to have his men blessed before bat- \ntle or healed after it. He shouldn't grumble \nabout the expense, because the spells also \nmake good tactical sense. The bless spell \nincreases the success of his army in the field. \nMagical cures get his army back on its feet \nquicker. All th& things can make him very \nsuccessful while also making him popular \nwith his hired men. \nFinally, the player character is expected to \nmake an effort to raise or restore slain \nhenchmen. This is not a normal expectation \nof hirelings or followers (although it can \nhappen in extreme cases). The effort should \nbe honest and true. A player character \nshouldn't fool himself into thinking no one \nwill notice if he doesn't do his utmost. The \nplayer character who returns from an \nadventure minus his henchman is automati- \ncally under a cloud of suspicion, despite his \nmost vehement protests. A player character \nmust take great care to maintain his reputa- \ntion as a good and upright employer. \n116"
