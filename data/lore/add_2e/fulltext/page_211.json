Each month the disease pro- \ngresses, the creature loses 2 points of Cha- \nrisma, permanently. \nThe inflicted disease can be cured by the \ncure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be \ncaused. \nDispel Magic (Abjuration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nhation: Special \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: =foot cube or 1 item \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a priest casts this spell, it has a \nchance to neutralize or negate the magic it \ncomes in contact with as follows: \nFirst, it has a chance to remove spells and \nspell-like effects (including device effects \nand innate abilities) from creatures or \nobjects. Second, it may disrupt the casting \nor use of these in the area of effect at the \ninstant the dispel is cast. Third, it may \ndestroy magical potions (which are treated \nas Uth level for purposes of this spell). \nEach effect or potion in the spell's area is \nchecked to determine if it is dispelled. The \ncaster can always dispel his own magic; oth- \nerwise the chance depends on the difference \nin level between the magical effect and the \ncaster. The base chance of successfully dis- \npelling is 11 or higher on IdzO. If the caster \nis higher level than the creator of the effect \nto be dispelled, the difference is subtracted \nfrm &is base number needed. If the caster \nis lower bel, then the difference is added to \nthe base. A die roll of 20 always succee& \nand a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a \ncaster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is \ntrying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the \neffect frm being dispelled. \nA dispel magic can affect only a specially \nmchanted item (such as a magical scroll, \nring, wad, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, \nweapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast \ndirectlyupon the item. Thisrenders the item \nnonoperational for Id4 rounds. An item \npossessed or carried by a creature has the \ncreature's saving throw against this effect; \nothcrwiso it is automatically rendered non- \noperational. An interdimensional interface \n(such as a bag of holding) rendered non- \noperational is temporarily closed. Note that \nan item's physical properties are unchanged: \na nonoperational magical sword is still a \nsword. \nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this \nspell, but some of their spell-like effects may \nbe, at the DMs option. \nSummary of Dispel Effects \nSource of Effect Reslsts As \nCaster None \nResult of Dispel \nDispel automatic \nOther caster/innate abilitv Level/HD of other caster J%& nenated \nArtifact DM discretion DM discretion \n* Effect negated; if cast directly on item, item becomes nonoperational for Id4 rounds. \nNote that this spell, if successful, will \nrelease charmed and similarly beguiled crea- \ntures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dis- \npelled; these are listed in the spell \ndescriptions. \nFeign Death (Necromancy) \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: Touch \nComponent: V \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: V2 \nArea of Effect: Person touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster or any \nother willing person can be put into a cata- \nleptic state that is impossible to distinguish \nfrom actual death. Although the person \naffected can smell, hear, and know what is \ngoing on, no feeling or sight of any sort is \npossible; thus, any wounding or mistreat- \nment of the body is not felt, no reaction \noccurs, and damage is only one-half nor- \nmal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or \nenergy level drain does not affect a person \nunder the influence of this spell, but poison \ninjected or otherwise introduced into the \nbody becomes effective when the spell recip- \nient is no longer under the influence of this \nspell, although a saving throw is permitted. \nHowever, the spell offers no protection \nfrom causes of certain death-being crushed \nunder a landslide, etc. Only a willing indi- \nvidual can be affected by a feign denth spell. \nThe priest is able to end the spell effect at \nany time, but it requires a full round for \nbodily functions to begin again. \nNote that, unlike the wizard version of \nthis spell, only people can be affected, and \nthat those of any level can be affected by the \npriest casting this spell. \n210 \nFlame Walk (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round + l/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature(s) touched \nSaving Throw: None \n1 By means of this spell, the caster I \nempowers one or more creatures to with- I \nstand nonmagical fires of temperatures up / \nto 2,OOOO E (enabling them to walk upon , \nmolten lava). It also confers a +2 bonus to \nsaving throws against magi4 fire and , \nreduces damage from such fires by one-half, \neven if the saving throw is failed. For every 1 experience level above the minimum 1 \nrequired to cast the spell (5th), the priest can 1 \naffect an additional creature. This spell is 1 \nnot cumulative with resist fire spells or \nlar protections. \nThe material components of the spell \nthe priest's holy symbol and at least 500 \nof powdered ruby per affected creature. \nGlyph of Warding \n(Abjuration, Evocation) \nSphere: Guardian \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until discharged \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nA glyph of warding is a powerful inscrip- \ntion magically drawn to prevent unauthor- \nized or hostile creatures from passing, \nentering, or opening. It can be used to guard \na small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap \non a chest or box. \nThe priest must set the conditions of the \nward; typically any creature violating the \nwarded area without speaking the name of \nthe glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A \nsuccessful saving throw vs. spell enables the \ncreature to escape the effects of the glyph. \nGlyphs can be set according to physical \ncharacteristics, such as creature type, size, \nand weight. Glyphs can also be set with \nrespect to good or evil, or to pass those of \nthe caster's religion. They cannot be set \n1"
