    "text": "Wizard Spells (1 st Level) \nto 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 \nfeet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or \nbackward have only a slight arc-about \ntwo feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The \njump spell does not ensure safety in landing \nor grasping at the end of the leap. \nThe material component of this spell is a \ngrasshopper’s hind leg, to be broken by the \ncaster when the spell is cast. \nLight (Alteration) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a luminous glow, equal \nto torchlight, within a fixed radius of the \nspell’s center. Objects in darkness beyond \nthis sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and \nshadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a \npoint selected by the caster, and he must \nhave a line of sight and unobstructed path \nfor the spell when it is cast. Light can spring \nfrom air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any \nsimilar substance. \nThe effect is immobile unless it is specifi- \ncally centered on a moveable object or \nmobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a \ncreature, the applicable magic resistance \nand saving throw rolls must be made. Suc- \ncessful resistance negates the spell, while a \nsuccessful saving throw indicates that the \nspell is centered immediately behind the \ncreature, rather than upon the creature \nitself. Light taken into an area of magical \ndarkness does not function, but if cast \ndirectly against magical darkness negates it \n(but only for the duration of the light spell, \nif the darkness effect is continual). \nLight centered on the visual organs of a \ncreature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls \nand saving throws by 4 and worsening its \nArmor Class by 4. The caster can end the \nspell at any time by uttering a single word. \nThe material component is a firefly or a \npiece of phosphorescent moss. \nMasic Missile (Evocation) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 or more creatures \nSaving Throw: None __ \nUse of the magic missile spell creates up to \nfive missiles of magical energy that dart \nforth from the wizards fingertip and unerr- \ningly strike their target. This includes ene- \nmy creatures in a melee. The target creature \nmust be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, \nhowever, so near-total concealment, such as \nin a 10-foot cube \nthat offered by arrow slits, can render the \nspell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must \nbe able to identify the target. He cannot \ndirect a magic missile to “Strike the com- \nmander of the legion,” unless he can single \nout the commander from the rest of the sol- \ndiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be \nsingled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) \ncannot be damaged by the spell, and any \nattempt to do so wastes the missiles to no \neffect. Against creatures, each missile \ninflicts ld4 + 1 points of damage. \nFor every two extra levels of experience, \nthe wizard gains an additional missile-he \nhas two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four \nat 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles \nat 9th level. If the wizard has multiple mis- \nsile capability, he can have them strike a sin- \ngle target creature or several creatures, as \ndesired. \nMending (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell repairs small breaks or tears in \nobjects. It will weld a broken ring, chain \nlink, medallion, or slender dagger, provid- \ning but one break exists. Ceramic or wood- \nen objects with multiple breaks can be \ninvisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A \nhole in a leather sack or wineskin is com- \npletely heal+ over by a mending spell. This \nspell does no , by itself, repair magical items \nof any type. bn e turn after the spell is cast, \nthe magic of the joining fades, and the effect \ncannot be magically dispelled. The maxi- \nmum volume of material the caster can \nmend is one cubic foot per level. \nThe material components of this spell are \ntwo small magnets of any type (lodestone in \nall likelihood) or two burrs. \nMessage (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can \nwhisper messages and receive replies with \nlittle chance of being overheard. When the \nspell IS cast,-the wizard secretly or openly \npoints his finger at each creature to be \nincluded in the spell effect. Up to one crea- \nture per level can be included. When the \nwizard whispers, the whispered message \ntravels in a straight line and is audible to all \nof the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus \n10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures \n------- \nwho receive the message can whisper aieply \nthat is heard by the spellcaster. Note that \nthere must be an unobstructed path between \nthe spellcaster and the recipients of the spell. \nThe message must be in a language the cast- \ner speaks; this spell does not by itself confer \nunderstanding upon the recipients. This \nspell is most often used to conduct quick \nand private conferences when the caster \ndoes not wish to be overheard. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nshort piece of copper drawn fine. \nMount (ConjuratiotVSuminoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 hours + 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 mount \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster conjures \na normal animal to serve him as a mount. \nThe animal serves willingly and well, but at \nthe expiration of the spell duration it disap- \npears, returning to its own place. The type \nof mount gained by this spell depends on the \nlevel of the caster; of course, a caster can \nchoose a lesser mount if desired. Available \nmounts include the following: \nCaster Level Mount \nlstdrd level \n4th-7th level Draft horse or \n8th-12th level Camel \n13th-14th level Elephant (and \n15th level & up \nMule or light horse \nwar horse \nhowdah at 18th level) \nGriffon (and saddle at \n18th level) \nThe mount does not come with any riding \ngear, unless it is of a class lower than the \ncaster would normally be entitled to; thus a \n4th-level wizard can gain a war horse with- \nout saddle and harness, or a light horse with \nsaddle and harness. The statistics of the ani- \nmal gained are typical of all creatures of the \nsame class. The mount disappears when \nslain. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of hair from the type of animal to be con- \njured. \nNystul’s Magical Aura \n(IIlusion/Phantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 dayllevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, any one item of no \nmore than five pounds weight per level of \nthe spellcaster can be given an aura that is \n136"
