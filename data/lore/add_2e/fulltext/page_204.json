    "text": "Priest Spells (2nd Level, \nThe priest casting an augury spell seeks to \ndivine whether an action in the immediate \nfuture (within one-half hour) will be for the \nbenefit of, or harmful to, the party. For \nexample, if a party is considering the \ndestruction of a weird seal that closes a por- \ntal, an augury spell can be used to find if \nweal or woe will be the immediate result. If \nthe spell is successful, the DM yields some \nindication of the probable outcome: \"weal,\" \n\"woe,\" or possibly a cryptic puzzle or \nrhyme. The base chance for receiving a \nmeaningful reply is YO%, plus 1% for each \nlevel of the priest casting the spell, e.g., 71% \nat 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. Your DM deter- \nmines any adjustments for the particular \nconditions of each augury. \nFor example, if the question is \"Will we do \nwell if we venture to the third level?\" and a \nterrible troll guarding 10,OOO s.p. and a \nshield +I lurks near the entrance to the \nlevel (which the DM estimates the party \ncould beat after a hard fight) the augury \nmight be: \"Great risk brings great reward.\" \nIf the troll is too strong for the party, the \naugury might be: \"Woe and destruction \nawait!\" Likewise, a party casting several \nauguries about the same action in quick suc- \ncession might receive identical answers, \nregardless of the dice rolls. \nThe material component for augury is a \nset of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or \nsimilar tokens of at least 1,OOO gp value \n(which are not expended in casting). \nBankskin (Alteration) \nSphere: Protection, Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a priest casts the barkskin spell \nupon a creature, its skin becomes as tough \nas bark, increasing its base Armor Class to \nAC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the \npriest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor \nClass 4 at 8th, and so on. This spell does not \nfunction in combination with normal armor \nor any magical protection. In addition, sav- \ning throw rolls vs. all attack forms except \nmagic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be \nplaced on the caster or on any other creature \nhe touches. \nIn addition to his holv svmbol. the caster \nmust have a handful of bark from an oak as \nthe material component of the spell. \nChant (ConjuratiodSummoning) \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Time of chanting \nCasting Time: 2 rounds \nArea of Effect: 30-fOOt radius \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of the chant spell, the priest \nbrings special favor upon himself and his \nparty, and causes harm to his enemies. \nWhen the chant spell is completed, all \nattack and damage rolls and saving throws \nmade by those in the area of effect who are \nfriendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, \nwhile those of the priest's enemies suffer - 1 \npenalties. This bonus/penalty continues as \nlong as the caster continues to chant the \nmystic syllables and is stationary. An inter- \nruption, however, such as an attack that \nsucceeds and causes damage, grappling the \nchanter, or a silence spell, breaks the spell. \nMultiple chants are not cumulative; how- \never, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken. \nwhile a priest of the same religious persua- \nsion (not merely alignment!) is chanting, the \neffect is increased to +2 and -2. \nCharm Person or Mammal \n(EnchantmentKharm) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 person or mammal \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell affects any single person or \nmammal it is cast upon. The creature then \nregards the caster as a trusted friend and ally \nto be heeded and protected. The term per- \nson includes any bipedal human, demihu- \nman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, \nincluding brownies, dryads, dwarves, \nelves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, \nhalflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, \nkobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, \nsprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a \n10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre \nis not. \nThe spell does not enable the caster to \ncontrol the charmed creature as if it were an \nautomaton, but any word or action of the \ncaster is viewed in the most favorable way. \nThus a charmed creature would not obey a \nsuicide command, but might believe the \ncaster if assured that the only chance to save \nthe caster's life is for the creature to hold \nback an onrushing red dragon for \"just a \nround or two\" and if the charmed creature's \n203 \nview of the situation suggests that this \ncourse of action still allows a reasonable \nchance of survival. \nThe subject's attitudes and priorities are \nchanged with respect to the caster, but basic \npersonality and alignment are not. A \nrequest that a victim make itself defenseless, \ngive up a valued item, or even use a charge \nfrom a valued item (especially against form- \ner associates or allies) might allow an imme- \ndiate saving throw to see if the charm is \nthrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature \ndoes not necessarily reveal everything it \nknows or draw maps of entire areas. Any \nrequest may be refused, if such refusal is in \ncharacter and does not directly harm the \ncaster. The victim's regard for the caster \ndoes not necessarily extend to the caster's \nfriends or allies. The victim does not react \nwell to the charmer's allies making sugges- \ntions such as, \"Ask him this question.. .,\" nor \ndoes the charmed creature put up with ver- \nbal or physical abuse from the charmer's \nassociates, if this is out of character. \nNote also that the spell does not empower \nthe caster with linguistic capabilities beyond \nthose he normally has. The duration of the \nspell is a function of the charmed creature's \nIntelligence, and it is tied to the saving \nthrow. The spell can be broken if a success- \nful saving throw is rolled. This saving throw \nis checked on a periodic basis according to \nthe creature's Intelligence, even if the caster \nhas not overly strained the relationship. \nPeriod Between \nIntelligence Score Checks \n3 or less 3 months \n4 to 6 2 months \n17 3 days \n18 2 days \n19 or more 1 day \nIf the caster harms, or attempts to harm, \nthe charmed creature by some overt action, \nor if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast \nupon the charmed creature, the charm is \nbroken automatically. \nIf the subject of the charm person/charm \nmammal spell successfully rolls its saving \nthrow vs. the spell, the effect is negated. \n. This spell, if used in conjunction with the \nanimal friendship spell, can keep the animal \nnear the caster's home base, if the caster \nmust leave for an extended period."
