    "text": "- \nPriest Snells (2nd Lekcr \nwilling creature receives a saving throw \nagainst the spell. If the saving throw is suc- \ncessful, the spell effect is centered about one \nfoot behind the position of the subject crea- \nture at the instant of casting. This spell pro- \nvides a defense against sound-based attacks, \nsuch as harpy singing, horn of blasting, etc. \nSlow Poison (Necromancy) \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is placed upon a poisoned \nindividual, it greatly slows the effects of \nvenom, if it is cast upon the victim before \nthe poison takes full effect. (This period, \nknown as the onset time, is known to the \nDM.) While this spell does not neutralize \nthe venom, it does prevent it from substan- \ntially harming the individual for the dura- \ntion of its magic in hopes that, during that \nperiod, a full cure can be accomplished. \nThe material components of the slow poi- \nson spell are the priest’s holy symbol and a \nbud of garlic that must be crushed and \nsmeared on the wound (or eaten if poison \nwas ingested). \n! Lharm (EnchantmenVCharm) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: =foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern \nis set up that causes one or more snakes to \ncease all activity except a semi-erect, swaying \nmovement. If the snakes are charmed while \nin a torpor, the duration of the spell is ld4 +2 \nturns; if the snakes are not torpid, but are not \naroused and angry, the charm lasts Id3 turns; \nif the snakes are angry or attacking, the \nsnake charm spell lasts ld4 + 4 rounds. The \npriest casting the spell can charm snakes \nwhose total hit points are less than or equal \nto those of the priest. On the average, a 1st- \nlevel priest could charm snakes with a total \nof 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could \ncharm 9 hit points, etc. The hit points can be \nthose of a mgle snake or those of several of \nthe reptiles, but the total hit points cannot ex- \nceed those of the priest casting the spell. A \n23-hit point caster charming a dozen &hit \npoint snakes would charm 11 of them. Ti$s \nspell is also effective against any ophidian or \nophidianoid monster, such as naga, cowtl, \netc., subject to magic resistance, hit points, \nand so foyth. \nVariations of this spell may exist, allow- \ning other creatures significant to a particular \nmythos to be affected. Your DM will inform \nyou if such spells exist. \nSpeak With Animals (Alteration) \nSphere: Animal, Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 roundsAeve1 \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 animal within \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell empowers the priest to compre- \nhend and communicate with any warm- or \ncold-blooded normal or giant animal that is \nnot mindless. The priest is able to ask ques- \ntions and receive answers of the creature, al- \nthough friendliness and cooperation are by \nno means assured. Furthermore, terseness \nand evasiveness are likely in basically wary \nand cunnirq creatures (the more stupid ones \nwill instead make inane comments). If the \nanimal is friendly or of the same general \nalignment as the priest, there is a possibility \nthat the animal will do some favor or service \nfor the priest. This possibility is determined \nby the DM. Note that this spell differs from \nthe speak with monsters spell, for this spell \nallows conversation only with normal or gi- \nant, non-fantastic creatures such as apes, \nbears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on. \n3GfOOt radius of priest \nSpiritual Hammer (Invocation) \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy calling upon his deity, the caster of a \nspiritual hammer spell brings into existence \na field of force shaped vaguely like a ham- \nmer. As long as the caster concentrates upon \nthe hammer, it strikes at any opponent \nwithin its range, as desired. Each round the \ncaster can choose to attack the same target \nas the previous round or switch to a new tar- \nget that he can see anywhere within his max- \nimum range. The spiritual hammer’s chance \nto successfully hit is equal to that of the \ncaster, without any Strength bonuses. In ad- \ndition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a \nbonus of + 1 for every six experience levels \n(or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total \nof +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the dam- \nage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base \ndamage inflicted when it scores a hit is ex- \nactly the same as a normal war hammer \n(ld4+1 vs. opponents of man size or \nsmaller, ld4 upon larger opponents, plus \nthe magical bonus). The hammer strikes in \nthe same direction as the caster is facing, so \nif he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear \nattack are gained along with the loss of any \nmodifications to the target’s AC for shield \nand Dexterity. \nAs soon as the caster ceases concentra- \ntion, the spirituul hammer spell ends. A dis- \npel magic spell that includes either the caster \nor the force in its area of effect has a chance \nto dispel the spiritual hammer. If an at- \ntacked creature has magicresistance, the re- \nsistance is checked the first time the spiritual \nhammer strikes. If the hammer is succes+ \nfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the \nhammer has its normal full effect for the du- \nration of the spell. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nnormal war hammer that the priest must \nhurl toward opponents while uttering a plea \nto his deity. The hammer disappears when \nthe spell is cast. \nTrip (EnchantmentKhann) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 object up to 10 feet long \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis magic must be cast upon a normal \nobject-a length of vine, a stick, a pole, a \nrope, or a simh object. The spell causes \nthe object to rise slightly off the ground or \nfloor it is resting on to trip most creatures \ncrossing it, if they fail their saving throws \nvs. spell. Note that only as many creatures \ncan be tripped as are actually stepping \nacross the enchanted object. Thus a three- \nfoot-long piece of rope could trip only one \nman-sized creature. Creatures moving at a \nvery rapid pace (running) when tripped suf- \nfer 1 point of damage and are std for \nld4 + 1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is \nvery hard (if it is turf or other soft material, \nthey are merely stunned for the rest of that \nround). Very large creatures, such as ek- \nphants, are not at all affected by a trip. Tlw \nobject continues to trip all creatures passins \nover it, including the spellcaster, for as 10% \nas the spell duration Iasts. A creature aware \nof the object and its potential adds a +4 bo- \nnus to its saving throw roll when crossing \nthe object. The enchanted object is 80% un- \ndetectable unless a means that detects magi- \ncal traps is employed or the operation of the \nspell is obseived. This spell does not func- \ntion under water. \n207"
