    "text": "Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) \nlar document before. To forge a name, an \nautograph of that person is needed, and a \nproficiency check with a -2 penalty must \nbe successfully rolled. To forge a longer doc- \nument written in the hand of some particu- \nlar person, a large sample of his \nhandwriting is needed, with a - 3 penalty to \nthe check. \nIt is important to note that the forger \nti.. always thinks he has been successful; the \nDM rolls the character's proficiency check \nin secret and the forger does not learn of a \nfailure until it is too late. \nIf the check succeeds, the work will pass \nexamination by all except those intimately \nfamiliar with that handwriting or by those \nwith the forgery proficiency who examine \nthe document carefully. If the check is \nfailed, the forgery is detectable to anyone \nfamiliar with the type of document or \nhandwriting-if he examines the document \nclosely. If the die roll is a 20, the forgery is \nimmediately detectable to anyone who nor- \nmally handles such documents without \nclose examination. The forger will not real- \nize this until too late. \nFurthermore, those with forgery profi- \nciency may examine a document to learn if \nit is a forgery. On a successful proficiency \nroll, the authenticity of any document can \nbe ascertained. If the die roll is failed but a \n20 is not rolled, the answer is unknown. If a \n20 is rolled, the character reaches the incor- \nrect conclusion. \nGaming: The character knows most com- \nmon games of chance and skill, including \ncards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. \nWhen playing a game, the character may \neither play out the actual game (which may \ntake too much time for some) or make a pro- \nficiency check, with success indicating vic- \ntory. If two proficient characters play each \nother, the one with the highest successful die \nroll wins. A character with gaming profi- \nciency can also attempt to cheat, thus gain- \ning a +1 bonus to his ability score. If the \nproficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, \nhowever, the character has been caught \ncheating (even if he won the game). \nGem Cutting: A character with this profi- \nciency can finish the rough gems that are \ndiscovered through mining at a rate of Id10 \nstones per day. A gem cutter derives no ben- \nefit from the assistance of nonproficient \ncharacters. A gem cutter must work with a \ngood light source and must have an assort- \nment of chisels, small hammers, and special- \nUncut gems, while still of value, are not \nnearly as valuable as the finished product. If \nthe cutting is successful (as determined by a \nproficiency check), the gem cutter increases \nthe value of a given stone to the range \nappropriate for its type. If a 1 is rolled, the \nwork is exceptionally brilliant and the value \nof the gem falls into the range for the next \nmost valuable gem (the DM has the relevant \n, ly hardened blades. \ntables). \nHealing A character proficient in healing \nknows how to use natural medicines and \nbasic principles of first aid and doctoring. If \nthe character tends another within one \nround of wounding (and makes a successful \nproficiency check), his ministrations restore \nId3 hit points (but no more hit points can be \nrestored than were lost in the previous \nround). Only one healing attempt can be \nmade on a character per day. \nIf a wounded character remains under the \ncare of someone with healing proficiency, \nthat character can recover lost hit points at \nthe rate of 1 per day even when traveling or \nengaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the \nwounded character gets complete rest, he \ncan recover 2 hit points per day while under \nsuch care. My characters with both heal- \ning and herbalism proficiencies can help \nothers recover at the rate of 3 hit points per \nday of rest. This care does not require a pro- \nficiency check, only the regular attention of \nthe proficient character. Up to six patients \ncan be cared for at any time. \nA character with healing proficiency can \nalso attempt to aid a poisoned individual, \nprovided the poison entered through a \nwound. If the poisoned character can be \ntended to immediately (the round after the \ncharacter is poisoned) and the care con- \ntinues for the next five rounds, the victim \ngains a + 2 bonus to his saving throw (delay \nhis saving throw until the last round of tend- \ning). No proficiency check is required, but \nthe poisoned character must be tended to \nimmediately (normally by sacrificing any \nother action by the proficient character) and \ncannot do anything himself. If the care and \nrest are interrupted, the poisoned character \nmust immediately roll a normal saving \nthrow for the poison. This result is unalter- \nable by normal means (Le., more healing \ndoesn't help). Only characters with both \nhealing and herbalism proficiencies can \nattempt the same treatment for poisons the \nvictim has swallowed or touched (the char- \nacter uses his healing to diagnose the poison \nand his herbalist knowledge to prepare a \npurgative). \nA character with healing proficiency can \nalso attempt to diagnose and treat diseases. \nWhen dealing with normal diseases, a suc- \ncessful proficiency check automatically \nreduces the disease to its mildest form and \nshortest duration. Those who also have her- \nbalism knowledge gain an additional +2 \nbonus to this check. A proficient character \ncan also attempt to deal with magical dis- \neases, whether caused by spells or creatures. \nIn this case, a successful proficiency check \ndiagnoses the cause of the disease. How- \never, since the disease is magical in nature, it \ncan be treated only by magical means. \nHeraldry: The knowledge of heraldry \nenables the character to identify the differ- \nent crests and symbols that denote different \n59 \npersons and groups. Heraldry comes in \nmany forms and is used for many different \npurposes. It can be used to identify noble- \nmen, families, guilds, sects, legions, politi- \ncal factions, and castes. The symbols may \nappear on flags, shields, helmets, badges, \nembroidery, standards, clothing, coins, and \nmore. The symbols used may include geo- \nmetric patterns, calligraphed lines of script, \nfantastic beasts, religious symbols, and \nmagical seals (made for the express purpose \nof identification). Heraldry can vary from \nthe highly formalized rules and regulations \nof late medieval Europe to the knowledge of \ndifferent shield patterns and shapes used by \nAfrican tribesmen. \nThe character automatically knows the \ndifferent heraldic symbols of his homeland \nand whom they are associated with. In addi- \ntion, if the character makes a successful pro- \nficiency check, he can correctly identify the \nsigns and symbols of other lands, provided \nhe has at least a passing knowledge of the \ninhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is \nof little use upon first entering a foreign \nland, \nHerbalism Those with herbalist kqowl- \nedge can identify plants and fungus and pre- \npare nonmagical potions, poultices, \npowders, balms, salves, ointments, infu- \nsions, and plasters for medical and pseudo- \nI \nmedical purposes. They can also prepam \nnatural plant poisons and purgatives. The \nDM must decide the exact strength of such \npoisons based on the poison rules in the \nDMG. A character with both herbalism and \nhealing proficiencies gains bonuses when \nusing his healing talent (see the Healing pro- \nficiency). \nHunting: When in wilderness settings \ncharacter can attempt to stalk and b \ndown game. A proficiency check mus \nmade with a - 1 penalty to the ability score \nfor every nonproficient hunter in the party. \nIf the die roll is successful, the hunter (and \nthose with him) have come within 101 to \n200 yards (100 + IdI00) of an animal. The \ngroup can attempt to close the range, but a \nproficiency check must be made for each 20 \nyards closed. If the stalking is successful, the \nhunter automatically surprises the game. \nThe type of animal stalked depends on the \nnature of the terrain and the whim of the \nDM. \nJuggling: The character can juggle, a tal- \nent useful for entertainments, diversions, \nand certain rare emergencies. When jug- \ngling normally (to entertain or distract), no \nproficiency check is required. A check is \nmade when trying spectacular tricks \n(\"Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!\"). \nHowever, juggling also enables the charac- \nter to attempt desperate moves. On a SUC- \ncessful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a \nproficiency check), the character can catch \nsmall items thrown to harm him (as \nopposed to items thrown for him to catch). \nI"
