The \nfirst three abilities represent the physical na- \nture of the character, while the second three \nquantify his mental and personality traits. \nIn various places throughout these rules, \nthe following abbreviations are used fc \nthe ability names: Strength-St. \nDexterity-Dex; Constitution-Con; In- \nRolling Ability Scares \nLet’s first see how \nto generate ability scores for your character, \nafter which definitions of each ability will \nbe given. \nThe six ability scores are determined ran- \ndomly by rolling six-sided dice to obtain a \nscore from 3 to 18. There are several meth- \nods for rolling up these scores. \nMethod I: Roll three six-sided dice (3d6); \nthe total shown on the dice is your charac- \nter’s Strength ability score. Repeat this for \nDexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis- \ndom, and Charisma, in that order. This \nmethod gives a range of scores from 3 to 18, \nwith most results in the 9 to 12 range. Only \na few characters have high scores (15 and \nabove), so you should treasure these charac- \nters. \n9ltemative Dice-Rolling Methods \nMethod I creates \ncharacters whose ability scores are usually \nbetween 9 and 12. If you would rather play \na character of truly heroic proportions, ask \nyour DM if he allows players to use optional \nmethods for rolling up characters. These op- \ntional methods are designed to produce \nabove-average characters. \nMethod II: Roll 3d6 twice, noting the to- \ntal of each roll. Use whichever result you \nprefer for your character‘s Strength score. \nRepeat this for Dexterity, Constitution, In- \ntelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. This al- \nlows you to pick the best score from each \npair, generally ensuring that your character \ndoes not have any really low ability scores \n(but low ability scores are not all that bad \nanywayl). \n* Method 111: Roll 3d6 six times and jot \ndown the total for each roll. Assign the \nscores to your character’s six abilities how- \never you want. This gives you the chance to \ncustom-tailor your character, although you \nare not guaranteed high scores. \nMethod IV: Roll 3d6 twelve times and jot \ndown all twelve totals. Choose six of these \nrolls (generally the six best rolls) and assign \nthem to your character’s abilities however \nyou want. This combines the best of meth- \nods I1 and 111, but takes somewhat longer. \nAs an example, Joan rolls 3d6 twelve \ntimes and gets results of 12,5,6,8,10,15,9, \n12,6,11,10, and 7. She chooses the six best \nrolls (15,12,12,11,10, and 10) and then as- \nsigns them to her character’s abilities so as to \ncreate the strengths and weaknesses that she \nwants her character to have (see the ability \ndescriptions following this section for expla- \nnations of the abilities). \nMethod V: Roll four six-sided dice (4d6). \nDiscard the lowest die and total the remain- \ning three. Repeat this five more times, then \nassign the six numbers to the character’s \nabilities however you want. This is a fast \nmethod that gives you a good character, but \nyou can still get low scores (after all, you \ncould roll Is on all four dice!). \nMethod VI: This method can be used if \nyou want to create a specific type of charac- \nter. It does not guarantee that you will get \nthe character you want, but it will improve \nyour chances. \nEach ability starts with a score of 8. Then \nroll seven dice. These dice can be added to \nyour character’s abilities as you wish. All \nthe points on a die must be added to the \nsame ability score. For example, if a 6 is \nrolled on one die, all 6 points must be as- \nsigned to one ability. You can add as many \ndice as you want to any ability, but no abil- \nity score can exceed 18 points. If you cannot \nmake an 18 by exact count on the dice, you \ncannot have an 18 score. \nThe Ability Scores \nThe six character \nabilities are described below. Each descrip- \ntion gives an idea of what that ability en- \ncompasses. Specific game effects are also \ngiven. At the end of each ability description \nis the table giving all modifiers and game in- \nformation for each ability score. The un- \nshaded area of these tables contains scores a \nplayer character can have naturally, with- \nout the aid of magical devices, spells, or di- \nvine intervention. The blue-shaded ability \nscores can be obtained only by extraordi- \nnary means, whether by good fortune (find- \ning a magical book that raises a score) or ill \nFortune (an attack by a creature that lowers \na score). \n13 \n(see Glossary) to determi& exceptional \nStrength; exceptional Strength improves the \ncharacter‘s chance to hit an enemy, increases \nthe damage. he causes with each hit, in- \ncreases the weight the character is able to \ncarry without a penalty for encumbrance \n(see below), and increases the character’s \nability to force open doors and similar por- \ntals. \nThe rest of this section on Strength con- \nsists of explanations of the columns in Table \n1. Refer to the table as you read. \nHit Probability adjustments are added to \nor subtracted from the attack roll rolled on \nldZ0 (one 20-sided die) during combat. A \nbonus (positive number) makes the oppo- \nnent easier to hit; a penalty (negative num- \nber) makes him harder to hit. \nDamage Adjustment also applies to com- \nbat. The listed number is added to or sub- \ntracted from the dice rolled to determine the \ndamage caused by an attack (regardless of \nsubtractions, a successful attack roll can \nnever cause less than 1 point of damage). \nFor example, a short sword normally causes \nld6 points of damage (a range of 1 to 6). An \nattacker with Strength 17 causes one extra \npoint of damage, for a range of 2 to 7 points \nof damage. The damage adjustment also ap- \nplies to missile weapons, although bows \nmust be specially made to gain the bonus; \ncrossbows never benefit from the user’s \nStrength . \nWeight Allowance is the weight (in \npounds) a character can carry without being \nencumbered (encumbrance measures how a \ncharacter’s possessions hamper his \nmovement-see Glossary). These weights \nare expressed in pounds. A character carry- \ning up to the listed weight can move his full \nmovement rate. \nMaximum Press is the heaviest weight a \ncharacter can pick up and lift over his head. \nA character cannot walk more than a few \nsteps this way. No human or humanoid \ncreature without exceptional Strength can \nlift more than twice his body weight over his \nhead. In 1987, the world record for lifting a \nweight overhead in a single move was 465 \npounds. A heroic fighter with Strength \n18/00 (see Table 1) can lift up to 480 pounds \nthe same way and he can hold it overhead \nFor a longer time! \nStrength \nsures a character’s muscle, endurance, and \nstamina. This ability is the prime requisite \nof warriors because they must be physically \npowerful in order to wear armor and wield \nheavy weapons. A fighter with a score of 16 \nor more in Strength gains a 10 percent bonus \nto the experience points he earns. \nFurthermore, any warrior with a Stre \nscore of 18 is entitled to roll percentile"
