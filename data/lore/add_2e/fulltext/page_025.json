    "text": "As a character ages, his ability scores are \naffected. Upon reaching one-half of his base \nmaximum age (45 for a human), the charac- \nter loses 1 point of Strength (or half of his \nexceptional Strength rating) and 1 point of \nConstitution, but gains 1 point each of Intel- \nligence and Wisdom. At two-thirds of his \nbase maximum age (60 for a human), the \ncharacter loses 2 more points of Strength (or \nall his exceptional Strength and 1 point \nmore), 2 points of Dexterity, and 1 more \npoint of Constitution, but he gains 1 point \nof Wisdom. Upon reaching the base maxi- \nmum age, the character loses 1 more point \nfrom each of Strength, Dexterity, and Con- \nstitution, while gaining 1 more point in both \nIntelligence and Wisdom. All aging adjust- \nments are cumulative.

There are \nno tables for these things, nor should there \nbe. Your job, as a player, is to add these \ndetails, thereby creating the type of charac- \nter you want. You probably know some \nfrom the start (do you want to play a tower- \ning, robust warrior, or a slim, unassuming \nswordsman?); others, especially your char- \nacter's personality, will grow and take form \nas you play. Remember, you are an actor \nand your character is your rolef \nAlthough many people have claimed t \nlive to great ages, the oldest human \nverifiable age was 113 years old in TOR \nand is still alive! \nThere may be times when a magical \ndevice or speil adds years to or subtracts \nycers from a player character's life. This \nmagical aging can have two different \neffects. Some magical aging physically \naffects the character. For example, a haste \nspell ages those it affects by one year. This \naging is added dinctly to the player charac- \nter's current age. He physically acquires the \nappearpnre of himself one year older (a few \nmore wrinkles, etc.). Characters who \nhaease in age from magical effects do not \ngilin the benefits of increased Wisdom and \nIntelligmce-theseare a function of the pas- \nwgc ot gamc time-but the character does \nterity, and Constitution associated with \naging. These are bseakdowns of the body's \n-. Physical age can also be removed \nin the same manner. Some potions give \nyeam back to the character.

In \nsuch a case, the actual age of the character is \nunaffefted. All adjustments are made by the \nDM to the character's maximum age (which \nonly the DMknows), For example, a human \nlongevity (10 to 60 years more). The DM \nhas already determined the human will nat- \nurally live to 103 years (base 90 + 2d20, in \nthis use 13).
