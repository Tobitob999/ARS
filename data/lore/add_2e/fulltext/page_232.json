The maximum dam- \nage it can inflict is Id2 points per caster level \n(thus, a 12th-level caster's rock might inflict \n12 to 24 points of damage). Movement, for \na man-sized rock, is 60 feet per round. A \nrock generally weighs from 100 to 300 \npounds per cubic foot. \nThe material components for the spell are \na stone and drop of the caster's blood. \nAstd Spell (Alteration) \nSphere: Astral \nRulge: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: V2 hour \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of the astral spell, a priest is \nable to project his astral body into the As- \ntral plane, leaving his physical body and \nmaterial possessions behind on the Prime \nMaterial plane. As the Astral plane touches \nupon the first levels of all the outer planes, \nthe priest can travel astrally to the first level \nof any of these outer planes as he wills. The \npriest then leaves the Astral plane, forming \na body on the plane of existence he has cho- \nsen to enter. It is also possible to travel as- \ntrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane \nby means of the astral spell (however, a sec- \nond body cannot be formed on the Prime \nMaterial plane; see following). \nAs a general rule, a person astrally pro- \njected can be seen only by creatures on the \nAstral plane. The astral body is connected \nat all times to the material body by a silvery \ncord. If the cord is broken, the affected per- \nson is killed, astrally and materially, but \ngenerally only the psychic wind can cause \nthe cord to break. When a second body is \nformed on a different plane, the silvery cord \nremains invisibly attached to the new body. \nIf the second body or astral form is slain, the \ncord simply returns to the caster's body \nwhere the body rests on the Prime Material \nplane, reviving it from its state of suspended \nanimation. Although astral projections are \nable to function on the Astral plane, their \nactions affect only creatures existing on the \nAstral plane; a physical body must be mate- \nrialized on other planes. \nThe spell lasts until the priest desires to \nend it, or until it is terminated by some out- \nside means (such as a dispel magic spell or \ndestruction of the priest's body on the Prime \nMaterial plane [which kills the priest]). The \npriest can project the astral forms of up to \nseven other creatures with himself by means \nof the astral spell, providing the creatures \nare linked in a circle with the priest. These \nfellow travelers are dependent upon the \npriest and can be stranded if something hap- \npens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane \ncan be slow or fast, according to the priest's \ndesire. The ultimate destination arrived at is \nsubject to the desire of the priest. \nChangestaff (Evocation, Enchantment) \nSphere: Plant, Creation \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: The caster's staff \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nchange a specially prepared staff into a \ntreant-like creature of the largest size (about \n24 feet tall). When the priest plants the end \nof the staff in the ground and speaks a spe- \ncial command and invocation, the staff \nturns into a treant-like creature with 12 Hit \nDice, 40 hit points, and Armor Class 0. It at- \ntacks twice per round, inflicting 4d6 points \nof damage with every successful attack. The \nstaff-treant defends the caster and obeys \nany spoken commands. However, it is by no \nmeans a true treant; it cannot converse with \nactual treants or control trees. The transfor- \nmation lasts either for as many turns as the \ncaster has experience levels, until the caster \ncommands the staff to return to its true \nform, or until the staff is destroyed, which- \never occurs first. If the staff-treant is re- \nduced to 0 hit points or less, it crumbles to a \nsawdust-like powder and the staff is de- \nstroyed. Otherwise, the staff can be used \nagain after 24 hours and the staff-treant is at \nfull strength. \nTo cast a changestaff spell, the caster must \nhave either his holy symbol or leaves (ash, \noak, or yew) of the same sort as the staff. \nThe staff for the changestaff spell must be \nspecially prepared. The staff must be a \nsound limb cut from an ash, oak, or yew \ntree struck by lightning no more than 24 \nhours before the limb is cut. The limb must \nthen be cured by sun drymg and special \nsmoke for 28 days. Then it must be shaped, \ncarved, and polished for another days. \nThe caster cannot adventure or engage in \nother strenuous activity during either of \nthese periods. The finished staff, engraved \nwith woodland scenes, is then rubbed with \nthe juice of holly berries, and the end of it is \nthrust into the earth of the caster's grove \nwhile he casts a speak with plant spefl, call- \ning upon the staff to assist in time of need. \nThe item is then charged with a magic that \nwill last for many changes from staff to \ntreant and back again. \nChariot Of Sustarre \nSphere: Elemental (Fire \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 12 hours \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, it brings forth a \nlarge, flaming chariot pulled by two fiery \nhorses from the elemental plane of Fire. \nThese appear in a clap of thunder amid a \ncloud of smoke. The vehicle moves at 24 on \nthe ground, 48 flying, and can cahy the \ncaster and up to seven other creatures of \nman-size or less (the passengers must be \ntouched by the caster to protect them from \nthe flames of the chariot). Creatures other \nthan the caster and his designated passen- \ngers sustain 2d4 points of fire damage each \nround if they come within five feet of the \nhorses or chariot. Such creatures suffer no \ndamage if they evade the area by rolling suc- \ncessful saving throws vs. petrification, with \nDexterity adjustments. \nThe caster controls the chariot by verbal \ncommand, causing the flaming steeds to \nstop or go, walk, trot, run or fly, and turn \nleft or right as he desires. Note that the char- \niot of Sustarre is a physical manifestation \nand can sustain damage. The vehicle and \nsteeds are struck only by magical weapons \nor by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 \npoint of damage), they are Armor Class 2, \nand each requires 30 points of damage to \ndispel. Naturally, fire has absolutely no ef- \nfect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but \nmagical fires other than thoae of the chariot \ncan affect the riders. Other spells, such as a \nsuccessful dispel magic or holy word, will \nforce the chariot back to its home plane, \nwithout its passengers. The chariot can be \nsummoned only once per week. \nThe material components are \npiece of wood, two holly berries, \nsource at least equal to a torch. \nConfusion (EnchantmenVCharm) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: ld4 creatures within \nSaving Throw: Special \na 40' by 4O'square \nThis spell causes confusion in one or more \ncreatures within the area, creating indeci- \nsion and the inability to take effective \naction. The spell affects ld4 creatures, plus \none creature per two caster levels. Thus, \nseven to ten creatures can be affected by a \n12th- or 13th-level caster, eight to 11 by a \n14th- or 15th-level caster. etc. These crea-"
