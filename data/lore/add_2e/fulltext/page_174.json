Huge and gargantuan crea- \ntures cannot be crushed by the wall. \nThe wall is permanent, unless success- \nfully dispelled, but it is subject to all forces a \nnod iron wall is subject to-rust, perfo- \nration, etc. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsmall piece of sheet iron. \nWall of Stone (Evocation) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates a wall of granite rock \nthat merges into adjoining rock surfaces. It \nis typically employed to close passages, por- \ntals, and breaches against opponents. The \nwall of stone is 1/4 inch thick and up to 20 \nsquare feet per level of experience of the \nwizard casting the spell. Thus, a 12th-level \nwizard can create a wall of stone three \ninches thick and up to 240 square feet in sur- \nface area (a =-foot-wide and 20-foot-high \nwall, for example, to completely close a 10’ \nX 16’ passage). The wall created need not \nbe vertical nor need it rest upon any firm \nfoundation (see the wull of iron spell); how- \never, it must merge with and be solidly sup- \nported by existing stone. It can be used to \nbridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. \nFor this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, \nthe wall must be arched and buttressed. \nThis requirement reduces the area of effect \nby half. Thus, a 20th-level caster can create \na span with a surface area of 200 square feet. \nThe wall can be crudely shaped to allow \ncrenelations, battlements, and 80 forth by \nlikewise reducing the area. The stone is per- \nmanent unless destroyed by a dispel magic \nspell or a disintegmte spell, or by normal \nmeans such as breaking or chipping. \nThe material component is a small block \nof granite. \nSixth-Level Spells \nAnti-Magic Shell (Abjuration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: l’/level diameter sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard sur- \nrounds himself with an invisible barrier that \nmoves with him. The area within this bar- \nrier is totally impervious to all magic and \nmagical spell effects, thus preventing the \npassage of spells or their effects. Likewise it \nprevents the functioning of any magical \nitems or spells within its confines. The area \nis also impervious to breath weapons, gaze \nor voice attacks, and similar special attack \nforms. \nThe anti-magic shell also hedges out \ncharmed, summoned, or conjured crea- \ntures. It cannot, however, be forced against \nany creature that it would keep at bay; any \nattempt to do creates a discernible pressure \nagainst the barrier, and continued pressure \nwill break the spell. Normal creatures (a \nnormally encountered troll rather than one \nconjured up, for instance) can enter the \narea, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, \nwhile a magical sword does not function \nmagically within the area, it is still a sword. \nNote that creatures on their home plane are \nnormal creatures there. Thus on the elemen- \ntal plane of Fire, a randomly encountered \nfire elemental cannot be kept at bay by this \nspell. Artifacts, relics, and creatures of \n173 \ndemigod or higher status are unaffected by \nmortal magic such as this. \nShould the caster be larger than the area \nenclosed by the barrier, parts of his person \nmay be considered exposed, at the referee’s \noption. A dispel magic spell does not re- \nmove the spell; the caster can end it upon \ncommand. \nBigby’s Forceful Hand (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nArea of Effect: special \n‘ Casting Time: 6 \nSaving Throw: None \nBaby‘s forceful hand is a more powerful \nversion of Bigby’s interposing hand. It cre \nates a man-sized (five feet) to gargantuan- \nsized (21 feet) hand that places itself \nbetween the spellcaster and a chosen oppo- \nnent. This disembodied hand then moves to \nremain between the two, regardless of what \nthe spellcaster does or how the oppomt \ntries to get around it. However, the forceful \nhand also pushes on the opponent. This \nforce can push away a creature weighing \n500 pounds or less, slow movement to 10 \nfeet per round if the creature weighs be- \ntween 500 and 2,000 pounds, or slow move- \nment by 50% if the creature weighs more \nthan 2,000 pounds. \nA creature pushed away is pushed to the \nrange limit, or until pd an un- \nyielding surface. The hand itself inflicts no \ndamage. The forceful hand has an Armor \nClass of 0, has as many hit points as its \ncaster in full health, and vanishes whar dq- \nstroyed. The caster can cause it to retmat (to \nrelease a trapped opponent, for exampie) or \ndismiss it on command. \nThe material component is a glove. \nChain Lightning (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nThis spell creates an electncai arscmrge \nthat begins as a single stroke of lightning, \n2% feet wide, commencing from the finger- \ntips of the caster. Unlike a lightning bolt \nspell, chain lightning strikes one object or \ncreature initially, then arcs to a series of \nother objects or creatures within range, los- \ning energy with each jump. \nThe bolt initially inflicts ld6 points of \ndamage per level of the caster, to a maxi- \nmum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or \ncreature rolls a successful saving throw vs. \nspell). After the first strike, the lightning \narcs to the next nearest object or creature. \nt"
