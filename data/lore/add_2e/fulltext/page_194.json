Upon \ncasting the spell, the Wizard’Wbes the \nsymbol upon whatever surface he desires. \nLikewise, the spellcaster is able to place the \nsymbol of his choice, using any one of the \nfOllo*: \nDeath \nDiscord \nFear \nHopelessness \nInsanity \nI \nPain \nOne or more creatures, \nwhose total hit points do \nnot exceed 80, are slain. \nAll creatures are affected \nand immediately fall to loud \nbickering and arguing; there \nis a 50% probability that \ncreatures of different align- \nments attack each other. \nThe bickering lasts for sd4 \nrounds, the fighting for 2d4 \nrounds. \nThis symbol creates an \nextra-strong fear spell, caw- \ning all creatures to save vs. \nspell with -4 penalties to \nthe die roll, or panic and flee \nas if attacked by a fear spell. \nAllaeaturesareaffected \nand must turn back in dejec- \ntion unless they save vs. \nspell. Affected creatures \nsubmit to the demands of \nany opponent-e.&, sur- \nrender, get out, etc.; the \nhopelessness lasts for 3d4 \nturns. During this period it \nis 25% probable that affect- \ned creatures take no action \nduring any round, and 25% \nlikely that those taking \naction turn back or retire \nfrom battle, as applicable. \nOne or more creatures \nwhose total hit points do \nnot exceed 120 become \ninsaneand remain so, acting \nas‘ if a confusion swll had \nbeen placed upon them, \nuntil a heal, restoration, or \nwish spell is used to remove \nthe madness. \nAll creatures are afflicted \nwith wracking pains shoot- \ning through their bodies, \ncausing a -2 penalty to \nDexterity and a -4 penalty \nto attack dice for 2d10 \nturns. \nSleep All creatures under 8 + 1 Hit \nDice immediately fall into a \ncatatonic slumber and can- \nnot be awakened for ld12 \n+4turns. \nStunning One or more creatures \nwhose total hit points do \nnot exceed 160 are stunned \nand reeling for 3d4 rounds, \ndropping anything they are \nholding. \nThe type of symbol cannot be recognized \nwithout being read and thus activating its \neffects. \nThe material components of this spell are \npowdered black opal and diamond dust, \nworth not less than 5,000 gp each. \nlhtp the Soul (Conjuration/Sumrnming) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until broken \nCasting Time: Special + 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell forces the creature’s life force \n(and its material body) into a special prison \ngem enchanted by the spellcaster. The crea- \nture must be seen by the caster when the \nfinal word is uttered. \nThe spell can be triggered in one of two \nways. First;‘thefinalwordd thespeUcanbe \nspoken when the aeature is within Speu \nrange. This allows magic resbtance (if any) \nand a saving throw va. spell to avoid the \neffea. If the creature’s real name is spoken \nas well, any magic resistance is ignored and \nthe saving throw vs. spell suffers a penalty \nof -2. If the saving throw is successful, the \nprison gem shatters. \nThe second method is far more insidious, \nfor it tricks the victim into accepting a trig- \nger object inscribed with the final spell \nword, automatically placing the creature‘s \nsoul into the trap. To use this method, both \nthe creature’s true MIW and the trigger \nword must be inscribed on the trigger item \nwhen the gem is enchanted. A sympathy \nspell can also be placed on the trigger item. \nAs soon as the subject creature picks up or \naccepts the trigger item, its life force is auto- \nmatically transferred to the gem, without \nthe benefit of magic resistance or saving \nthrow. \nThe gem prison will hold the trapped enti- \nty indefinitely, or until the gem is broken \nand the life force is released, allowing the \nmaterial body to reform. If the creature \ntrapped is a powerful creature from another \nplane (and this could actually mean a char- \nacter trapped by some inhabitant of another \nplane of existence when the character is not \non the Prime Material plane), it can be \nrequired to perform a service immediately \nupon being freed. Otherwise the creature \n:an go free onee the gem imprisonhg it is \nwoken. \nBefore the actual casting of the trap the \noul spell, the wizard must prapare the \nnison, a gem of at least 1,000 gp value for \nvery Hit Die or level of experhce po% \nessed by the creature to be trapped (e.g., it \nquires a gem of 10,000 gp value tb trap a \n0 Hit Die or loth-level creature). If the gem \nE not valuable enough, it shatters when the \nntrapment is attempted. (Note that whih \nharacters have no concept of level as such, \nhe value of the gem needed to trap an id- \nid4 can be researched. Remember that \nhis value can change over time as charac- \ntrs advance.) Creating the prison gem \nequires an enchant an item spell and the \nlacement of a mlue spell into the gem, \niereby forming the prison to contain the \nfe force. \n193"
