The spell seals the \narea from teleportation, plane shifting, and \nethereal penetration. At the option of the \ncaster, the ward can be locked by a \npassword, in which case it can be entered \nonly by those speaking the proper words. \nOtherwise, the effect on those entering the \nenchanted area is based on their alignment, \nrelative to the caster's. The most severe pen- \nAlignment identical: No effect.

If \npassword locked, cannot enter unless \npassword is known. \nAlignment different with respect to good \nund mil: Save vs. spell to enter this area; if \nfailed, suffer 4d6 points of damage. If word \nlocked, cannot enter unless password is \nknown. The attempt does cause damage if \nthe save is failed. \nOnce a saving throw is failed, an intruder \ncannot enter the forbidden area until the \nspell ceases. The ward cannot be dispelled \nby a caster of lesser level than the one who \nestablished it. Intruders who enter by roll- \ning successful saving throws feel uneasy and \ntense, dcspite their success. \nIn addition to the priest's holy symbol, \ncomponents include holy water and rare \nincenses worth at least 1,OOO gp per 60-foot \ncube. If a password lock is desired, this also \nrequires the burning of rare incenses worth \nat least 5,000 gp per 60-foot cube. \naltyisused. \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe very potent heal spell enables the \npriest to wipe away disease and injury in the \ncreature who receives the benefits of the \nspell. It completely cures all diseases or \nblindness of the reapient and heals all \npoints of damage suffered due to wounds or \ninjury. It dispels a feeblemind spell. It cures \nthose mental disorders caused by spells or \ninjury to the brain. Naturally, the effects can \nbe negated by later wounds, injuries, and \ndiseases. \nThe reverse, harm, infects the victim with \na disease and causes loss of all but ld4 hit \npoints, if a successfd touch is inflicted. For \ncreatures that are not affected by the heal \n(or harm) spell, see the cure light wounds \nspell. \nHeroes' Feast (Evocation) \nSphere: Geation \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 individual/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the priest to bring forth \na great feast that serves as many creatures as \nthe priest has levels of experience. The spell \ncreates a magnificent table, chairs, service, \nand all the necessary food and drink. The \nfeast takes one full hour to consume, and \nthe beneficial effects do not set in until after \nthis hour is over. Those partaking of the \nfeast are cured of all diseases, are immune to \npoison for l2 hours, and are healed of \nld4 + 4 points of damage after imbibing the \nnectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. \nThe ambrosia-like food that is consumed is \nequal to a bless spell that lasts for 12 hours. \nAlso, during this same period, the people \nwho consumed the feast are immune to fear, \nhopelessness, and panic. If the feast is inter- \nrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined \nand all effects of the spell are negated. \nThe material components of the spell are \nthe priest's holy symbol and specially fer- \nmented honey taken from the cells of bee \nlarvae destined for royal status. \ntment) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 oak tree \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the caster to charm a \nhealthy oak tree (or'other type if the DM \nallows) to cause it to serve as a protector. \nThe spell can be cast on a single tree at a \ntime. While a liveoak spell cast by a particu- \nlar caster is in effect, he cannot cast another \nsuch spell. The tree upon which the spell is \ncast must be within 10 feet of the caster's \ndwelling place, within a place sacred to the \ncaster, or within 100 yards of something \nthat the caster wishes to guard or protect. \nThe liveoak spell can be cast upon a \nhealthy tree of small, medium, or large size, \naccording to desire and availability, A trig- \ngering phrase of up to a maximum of one \nword per level of the spellcaster is then \nplaced upon the targeted oak; for instance, \n\"Attack any persons who come near with- \nout first saying 'sacred mistletoe' '' is an 11- \nword trigger phrase that could be used by a \ncaster of 11th level or higher casting the \nspell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into \nanimating as a treant of equivalmt size, an \nArmor Class of 0 and with two attacks per \nround, but with only a %foot-per-round \nmovement rate. \nDamage \nPer \nTreeSize Height HitDice Attack \nSmall 12'-14' 7-8 2d8 \nMedium 16'-19' 9-10 3d6 \nLarge 20'-23'+ 11-12 4d6 \nA tree enchanted by this spell radiates a \nmagical aura (if checked for), and can be \nreturned to normal by a successful casting \nof a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of \nthe caster who enchanted it. If dispelled, the \ntree takes root immediately. If released by \nthe caster, it tries to return to its original \nlocation before taking root. Damage to the \ntree can be healed with a plant growth spell, \nwhich restores 3d4 points of damage. A \nplant growth spell used in this fashion does \nnot increase the size or hit points of the \nliveoak beyond the original value. \nThe caster needs his holy symbol to cast \nthis spell. \n228"
