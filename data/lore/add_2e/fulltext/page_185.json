He is thus invisible \nwhen turned sideways. This invisibility can \nbe detected only by means of a true seeing \nspell or similar methods. In addition, the \nduo-dimensional wizard can pass through \nthe thinnest of spaces as long as these have \nthe proper height-going through the space \nbetween a door and its frame is a simple \nmatter. The wizard can perform all actions \nnormally. He can turn and become invisible, \nmove in this state, and appear again next \nround and cast a spell, disappearing on the \nfollowing round. \nNote that when turned, the wizard cannot \nbe affected by my form of attack, but when \nvisible, he is subject to double the amount of \ndamage normal for an attack form, e.g., a \ndagger thrust would inflict 2d4 points of \ndamage if it struck a duodimensional wiz- \nard. Furthermore, the wizard has a portion \nof his existence in the Astral plane when the \nspell is in effect, and he is subject to possible \nnotice by creatures there. If noticed, it is \n25% probable that the wizard is pulled en- \ntirely into the Astral plane by any attack \nfrom an astral creature. Such an attack (and \nany subsequent attack received on the As- \ntral plane) inflicts normal damage. \nThe material components of this spell are \na flat ivory likeness of the spellcaster (which \nmust be of finest workmanship, gold fili- \ngreed, and enameled and gem-studded at an \naverage cost of 500 to 1,OOO gp) and a strip \nof parchment. As the spell is uttered, the \nparchment is given a half twist and joined at \nthe ends. The figurine is then passed \nthrough the parchme \nappear forever. \nFinger of Death (Necromancy) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe finger of death spell snuffs out the \nvictim's life force. If successful, the victim \ncan be neither raised nor resurrected. In ad- \ndition, in human subjects the spell initiates \nchanges to the body such that after three \ndays the caster can, by means of a special \nceremony costing not less than 1,OOO gp plus \n500 gp per body, animate the corpse as a ju- \nju zombie under the control of the caster. \nThe changes can be reversed before anima- \ntion by a limited wish or similar spell cast di- \nrectly upon the body, while a full wish \nrestores the subject to life. \nThe caster utters the finger of death spell \nincantation, points his index finger at the \ncreature to be slain, and unless the victim \nsucceeds in a saving throw vs. spell, death \noccurs. A creature successfully saving still \nreceives 2d8 + 1 points of damage. If the \nsubject dies of damage, no internal changes \noccur and the victim can then be revived \nnormally. \nForcecage (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards per 2 levels \nComponents: V, S + special \nDuration: 6 turns + l/level \nCasting Time: 3-4 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nThis powerful spell enables the caster to \nbring into being a cube of force, but it is un- \nlike the magical item of that name in one im- \nportant respect: The forcecage does not \nhave solid walls of force; it has alternating \nbands of force with 1/2-inch gaps between. \nThus, it is truly a cage rather than an en- \nclosed space with solid walls. Creatures \nwithin the area of effect of the spell are \ncaught and contained unless they are able to \npass through the openings-and of course \nall spells and breath weapons can pass \nthrough the gaps in the bars of force of the \nforcecage. \nA creature with magic resistance has a \nsingle attempt to pass through the walls of \nthe cage. If the resistance check is success- \nful, the creature escapes. If it fails, then the \ncreature is caged. Note that a successful \ncheck does not destroy the cage, nor does it \nenable other creatures (save familiars) to \nflee with the escaping creature. The force- \ncage is also unlike the solid-walled protect- \nive device, cube of force, in that it can be \ngotten rid of only by means of a dispel \nmagic spell or by the expiration of the spell. \nBy means of special preparation at the \ntime of memorization, a forcecage spell can \nbe altered to a forcecube spell. The cube cre- \nated is 10 feet on a side, and the spell then re- \nsembles that of a cube of force in all respects \nsave that of the differences between a cast \nspell and the magic of a device, including \nthe methods of defeating its power. \nAlthough the actual casting of either ap- \nplication of the spell requires no material \ncomponent, the study required to commit it \nto memory does demand that the wizard \npowder a diamond of at least 1,OOO gp \nvalue, using the diamond dust to trace the \noutlines of the cage orcube he desires to cre- \nate via spellcasting at some later time. Thus, \nin memorization, the diamond dust is em- \nployed and expended, for upon completion \n184 \n- \nof study, the wizard must then toss the dust \ninto the air and it will disappear. \nLimited Wish (Conjuration/Summoning, \nInvocatiodEvocation) \nRange: Unlimited \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Special , \nThe limited wish is a very potent but diffi- \ncult spell. It will fulfill literally, but azdy \npartially or for a limited duration, tb ut&er- \nance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actd@ ad \nthe past, present, or future might be d&e?$d \n(but possibly only for the wizard h th \nwording of the spell is most carefu \nin some limited manner. The use \nwish will not substantially cha \nalities, nor will it bring wealth \nmerely by asking. The spell can, fer rxam- \nple, restore some hit points (or all kh points \nfor a limited duration) lost by the wizard. It \ncan reduce opponent hit probabilities or \ndamage, increase duration of some magical \neffect, cause a creature to be favorably dis- \nposed to the spellcaster, mimic a spell of 7th \nlevel or less, and so on (see the wish spell). \nGreedy desires usually end in disaster for \nthe wisher. Casting time is based on the time \nspent preparing the wording for the me11 \n(cleveipliyers &de what thTey want tosay \nbefore using the spell). Normally the casting \ntime is one round (most of it being taken up \nby deciding what to say). Casting this spell \nages the caster one year per 100 years of reg- \nular life span. \nMass Invisibility \nWusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis is a more extensive adaptation of the \ninvisibility spell for battlefield use. It can \nhide creatures in a 60 yd. x 60 yd. area; up \nto 300 to 400 man-sized creatures, 30 to 40 \ngiants, or six to eight large dragons. The ef- \nfect is mobile with the unit and is broken \nwhen the unit attacks. Individuals 1 \nthe unit become visible. The wizard c \nthis spell upon command. \nThe material component of the mass * \nvisibility spell are an eyelash and a bit \ngum arabic, the former encased in the latt"
