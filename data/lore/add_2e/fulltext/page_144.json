    "text": "Knock (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 60 yards \nComponent: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10 square reerilevel \nSaving Throw: None \nThe knock spell opens stuck, barred, \nlocked, held, or wizard-locked doors. It \nopens secret doors, as well as locked or \ntrick-opening boxes or chests. It also loos- \nens welds, shackles, or chains. If used to \nopen a wizard-locked door, the spell does \nnot remove the former spell, but simply sus- \npends its functioning for one turn. In all \nother cases, it permanently opens locks or \nwelds-although the former could be closed \nand locked again later. It does not raise \nbarred gates or similar impediments (such as \na portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, \nand the like. Note that the effect is limited \nby the area; a 3rd-level wizard can knock a \ndoor of 30 square feet or less (e.g., a stand- \nard 4' x 7' door). Each spell can undo up to \ntwo means of preventing egress through a \nportal. Thus if a door is locked, barred, and \nheld, or triple locked, opening it requires \ntwo knock spells. In all cases, the location of \nthe door or item must be known-the spell \ncannot be used against a wall in hopes of \ndiscovering a secret door. \nThe reverse spell, lock, closes and locks a \ndoor or similar closure, provided there is a \nphysical mechanism. It does not create a \nweld, but it locks physically operated lock- \ning mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to \ntwo functions. It cannot affect a portcullis. \nKnow Alignment (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nper 2 rounds \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA know alignment spell enables the wiz- \nard to read the aura of a creature or an \naligned object (unaligned objects reveal \nnothing). The caster must remain stationary \nand concentrate on the subject for two full \nrounds. A creature is allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell and, if successful, the caster \nlearns nothing about that particular crea- \nture from the casting. If a creature or object \nis concentrated on for only one round, only \nits alignment with respect to law and chaos \ncan be learned. Certain magical devices ne- \ngate the know alignment spell. \nThe reverse, undetectable alignment, \nconceals the alignment of an object or crea- \n143 \nture for 24 hours-even from a know align- \nment spell. \nLeomund's Trap (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: Object touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis false trap is designed to fool a thief or \nother character attempting to pilfer the \nspellcaster's goods. The wizard places the \nspell upon any small mechanism or device, \nsuch as a lock, hinge, hasp, screw-on cap, \nratchet, etc. Any character able to detect \ntraps, or who uses any spell or device ena- \nbling trap detection, is 100% certain a real \ntrap exists. Of course, the spell is illusory \nand nothing happens if the trap is sprung; its \nprimary purpose is to friiten away thieves \nor make them waste precious time. \nThe material component of the spell is a \npiece of iron pyrite touched to the object to \nbe trapped while the object is sprinkled with \na special dust requiring 200 gp to prepare. If \nanother LeomundS trap is within 50 feet \nwhen the spell is cast, then the casting fails. \nLevitate (Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen a levitate spell is cast, the wizard \ncan place it upon his person, upon an ob- \nject, or upon a single creature, subject to a \nmaximum weight limit of 100 pounds per \nlevel of experience (e.g., a 3rd-level wizard \ncan levitate up to 300 pounds maximum). If \nthe spell is cast upon the wizard, he can \nmove vertically up or down at a movement \nrate of 2 per round. If cast upon an object or \nanother creature, the wizard can levitate it \nat the same speed according to his com- \nmand. Horizontal movement is not empow- \nered by this spell, but the recipient could \npush along the face of a cliff, for example, to \nmove laterally. The spellcaster can cancel \nthe spell as desired. If the subject of the spell \nis unwilling, or the object is in the posses- \nsion of a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is \nallowed to determine if the levitate spell af- \nfects it. \nOnce cast, the spell requires no concen- \ntration, except when changing height. A \nlevitating creature attempting to use a mis- \nsile weapon finds himself increasingly un- \nstable; the first attack has an attack roll \npenalty of -1, the second -2, and the third \n-3, etc., up to a maximum of -5. A full \nround spent stabilizing allows the creature \nto begin again at -1. lack of leverage \nmakes it impossible to cock a meclium or \nheavy crossbow. \nThe material component of this speH is ei- \nther a small leather loop or a piece of \nwire bent into a cup shape with a lon \non one end \n' ' \nLocate Object (Divination) \nReversible \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell aids in locating a known or fa- \nmiliar object. The wizard casts the spell, \nslowly turns, and senses when he is facirtg in \nthe direction of the object to be located, pro- \nvided the object is within range, i.e., 60 \nyards for 3rd-level mages, 80 yards for rth, \n100 yards for 5th, etc. The spell can locate \nsuch objects as apparel, jewelry, furniture, \ntools, weapons, or even a ladder or stair- \nway. Note that attempting to find a specific \nitem such as jewelry or a crown, requires an \naccurate mental image; if the image is not \nclose enough to the actual, the spell does not \nwork. Desired but unique objects cannot be \nlocated by this spell unless they are known \nby the caster. The spell is blocked by lead. \nCreatures cannot be found by this spell. \nThe material component is a forked twig. \nThe reversal, obscure object, hides an ob- \nject from location by spell, crystal ball, or \nsimilar means for eight hours. Creatures \ncannot be affected by this spell. The mate- \nrial component is a chameleon skin. \nMaglc Mouth (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard imbues \nthe chosen object with an enchanted mouth \nthat suddenly appears and speaks his mes- \nsage when a specified event occurs. The \nmessage, which must be of 25 words or less, \ncan be in any language known by the spell- \ncaster, and can be delivered over a one-turn \nperiod. The mouth cannot speak magical \nspells or use command words. It does, how- \never, move to the words articulated-if it is \nplaced upon a statue, the mouth of the \nstatue would actually move and appear to \nspeak. Of course, the magic mouth can be \nplaced upon a tree, rock, door, or any other \nobject, excluding intelligent membem of the \nanimal or vegetable kingdoms."
