Lastly, a cantrip lacks th \npower to duplicate any other spell effects. \nWhatever manifestation the cantril \ntakes, it remains in effect only as long as th \nwizard concentrates. Wizards typically us \ncantrips to impress common folk, amus \nchildren, and brighten dreary lives. Com \nmon tricks with cantrips include tinklings o \nethereal music, brightening faded flowers \nglowing balls that float over the caster’ \nhand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spic \ning up aromas and flavors of bland food \nand little whirlwinds to sweep dust undei \nrugs.

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be \ncharmed, but an ogre could not. \nThe person receives a saving throw vs. \nspell to avoid the effect, with any adjust- \nment due to Wisdom (see Table 5).

If the caster \nharms, or attempts to harm, the charmed \nperson by some overt action, or if a dispel \nmagic spell is successfully cast upon the \ncharmed person, the charm spell is broken. \nIf two or more charm effects simultane- \nously affect a creature, the result is decided \nby the DM. This could range from one effect \nbeing clearly dominant, to the subject being \ntom by conflicting desires, to new saving \nthrows that could negate both spells. \nNote that the subject has full memory of \n:he events that took place while he was \n:harmed. \nIntelligence Score Time Between Checks \n3 or less 3 months \n2 months 4 to 6 \n7 to 9 1 month \n10 to 12 3 weeks \n13 to 14 2 weeks \n15 to 16 1 week \n17 3 days \n18 2 days \n19 or more 1 day \nNote: The period between checks is the \n[me period during which the check occurs. \nVhen to roll the check during this time is \netermined (randomly or by selection) by \nle DM.
