    "text": "Combat (Special Damage) \nbugbear that inflicts 7points of damage, Cwell \nhas suffered 10 points of points of damage. \nThis 10 points of hge remains until Cwell \nheals, either naturally or through magical \nmeans. \nwowrdr \nWhen a character \nhits a monster, or vice versa, damage is suf- \nfered by the victim. The amount of damage \ndepends on the weapon or method of attack. \nIn Table 44 of Chapter 6, all weapons are rated \nfor the amount of damage they inflict to \nSmall, Medium, and Large targets. This is \ngiven as a die range (ld8, 2d6, etc.). \nEaJl time a hit is scored, the appropriate \ndice are rolled and the damage is subtracted \nfrom the current hit points of the target. An \norc that attacks with a sword, for example, \ncauses damage accotdmg to the information \ngiven for the type of sword it uses. A troll \nthat bites once and rends with one of its \ndawed hands causes 2d6 points of damage \nwith its bite and ld4+4 points with its claw. \n(The DM gets this information from the \nMonstrous Compendium.) \nSometimes damage is listed as a die range \nalong with a bonus of +1 or more. The \ntroll's claw attack, above, is a good exam- \nple. This bonus may be due to high \nStrength, magical weapons, or the sheer fe \nrocity of the creature's attack. The bonus is \nadded to whatever number comes up on the \ndie roll, assuring that some minimum \namount of damage is cad. Likewise, pen- \nalties can also be applied, but no successful \nattack can result in less than 1 point of dam- \nage. \nSometimes an attack has both a die roll \nand a damage multiplier. The number rolled \non the dice is multiplied by the multiplier to \ndetermine how much damage is inflicted. \nThis occurs mainly in backstabbing at- \ntempts. In cases where damage is multi- \nplied, only the base damage caused by the \nweapon is multiplied. Bonuses due to \nStrength or magic are not multiplied; they \nare added after the rolled damage is multi- \nplied. \nSpecial Damage \nGetting hit by wea- \npons or monsters isn't the only way a charac- \nter can get hurt. Indeed, the world is full of \ndangers for poor, hapless player characters, \ndangers the DM can occasionally spring on \nthem with glee. Some of the nastier forms of \ndamage are described below. \nhave a marvelous (and, to the DM, vastly \namusing) tendency to fall off things, gener- \nallv from great heights and almost always \nonto hard surfaces. While the falling is \nharmless, the abrupt stop at the end tends to \ncause damage. \nWhen a character'falls, he suffers ld6 \npoints of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to \na maximum of 2Od6 (which for game pur- \nposes can be considered terminal velocity). \nThis method is simple and it provides all \nthe realism necessary in the game. It is not a \nscientific calculation of the rate of accelera- \ntion, exact terminal velocity, mass, impact \nenergy, etc., o the falling body. \nThe fact of the matter is that physical \nlaws may describe the exact motion of a \nbody as it falls through space, but relatively \nlittle is known about the effects of impact. \nThe distance fallen is not the only determin- \ning factor in how badly a person is hurt. \nOther factors may include elasticity of the \nfalling body and the ground, angle of im- \npact, shock wave through the falling body, \ndumb luck, and more. \nPeople have actually fallen from great \nheights and survived, albeit very rarely. The \ncurrent record-holder, Vesna Vulovic, sur- \nvived a fall from a height of 33,330 feet in \n1972, although she was severely injured. \nFlight-Sergeant Nicholas S. Alkemade actu- \nally fell 18,000 feet-almost 3.5 miles- \nwithout a parachute and landed uninjured! \nThe point of all this is roll the dice, as de- \nscribed above, and don't worry too much \nabout science. \n'i \nParalysis \nA character or \ncreature affected by paralysis becomes to- \ntally immobile for the duration of the spell's \neffect. The victim can breathe, think, see, \nand hear, but he is unable to speak or move \nin any manner. Coherent thought needed to \ntrigger magical items or innate powers is \nstill possible. \nParalysis affects only the general motor \nfunctions of the body and is not the ultimate \ndestroyer of powerful creatures. It can be \nparticularly potent on flying creatures, \nhowever. \nAn Example of Paralysis: The adventur- \ners encounter a beholder, a fearsome crea- \nture with magical powers that emanate from \nits many eyes. \nAfter several rounds of combat, the par- \nty's priest casts a hold monster spell, para- \nlyzing the creature. The paralyzed beholder \ncan still use the spell-like powers of its eyes \nand can still move about (since it levitates at \nwill). But, on the other hand, it is not able to \nmove its eyestalks to aim. Since all of its \neyes were most likely facing forward at the \nmoment of paralysis, the adventurers clev- \nerly spread out in a ring around the crea- \nture. To attack one or two of them with its \npowers, the beholder must turn its back on \nthe rest. \nEnergy Drain \nThis is a feature of \npowerful undead (and other particularly \nnasty monsters). The energy drain is a par- \nticularly horrible power, since it causes the \nloss of one or more experience leveIsl I \nWhen a character is hit by an energy- \ndraining creature, he suffers normal damage \nfrom the attack. In addition, the character \nloses one or more levels (and thus Hit Dice \nand hit points). For each level lost, roll the \nHit Dice appropriate to the character's class \nand subtract that number of hit points from \nthe character's total (subtract the Constitu- \ntion bonus also, if applicable). If the level(s) \nlost was one in which the character received \na set number of hit points rather than a die \nroll, subtract the appropriate number of hit \npoints. The adjusted hit point total is now \nthe character's maximum (Le., hit points \nlost by energy drain are not taken as dam- \nage but are lost permanently). \nThe character's experience points drop to \nhalfway between the minimum needed for \nhis new (post-drain) level and the minimum \nneeded for the next level abwe his new \nlevel. \nMulti-class and dual-class characters lose \ntheir highest level first. If both levels are \nequal, the one requiring the greater number \nof experience points is lost first. \nAll powers and abilities gained by the \nplayer character by virtue of his former \nlevel are immediately lost, including spells. \nThe character must instantly forget any \nspells that are in excess of those allowed for \nhis new level. In addition, a wizard loses all \nunderstanding of spells in his spell books \nthat are of higher level than he can now cast. \nUpon regaining his previous level, the spell- \ncaster must make new rolls to see if he can \nrelearn a spell, regardless of whether he \nknew it before. \nIf a character is drained to 0th level but \nstill retains hit points (i.e., he is still alive), \nthat character's adventuring career is over. \nHe cannot regain levels and has lost all ben- \nefits of a character class. The adventwer has \nbecome an ordinary person. A restoration \nor wish spell can be used to allow the char- \nacter to resume his adventuring career. If a \n0th-level character suffers another energy \ndrain, he is slain instantly, regardless of the \nnumber of hit points he has remaining. \nIf the character is drained to less than 0 \nlevels (thereby slain by the undead), he re- \nturns as an undead of the same type as his \nslayer in M4 days. The newly risen undead \nhas the same character class abilities it had \nin normal life, but with only half the experi- \nence it had at the beginning of its encounter \nwith the dead who slew it. \nThe hew undead is automatically an \nNPC! His goals and ambitions are utterly \nopposed to those he held before. He pos- \nsesses great hatred and contempt for his \n104"
