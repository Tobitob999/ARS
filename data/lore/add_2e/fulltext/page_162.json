Magic \nresistance is checked first to determine Spes1 \noperatioq, and then the fear/Wisdixn bonus \napplies ag a minus to the dice roll to match \nor score 1- than Intelligence. \nIf the su&ct of a phantasmal killer attack \nsucceeds in disbelieving, and he is wearing a \nhelm of telepathy, the beast can be turned \nupon the wizard, who must then disbelieve \nit or be subject to its attack and possible \neffects. \nIf the subject ignores the killer to perform \nother actions, such as attacking the caster, \nthe kiIler may, at the DMs option, gain \nbonuses to hit (for flank or rear attacks, \netc.). Spells such as remove fear and cloak \nof brmery, cast after the killer has attacked, \nant another check to disbelieve the effect. \nI Duration: Casting Time: Permanent 4 \nArea of Effect: An area 10’ per side/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a plant growth spell is cast, the wiz- \nard causes normal vegetation to grow, \nentwine, and entangle to form a thicket or \njungle that creatures must hack or force a \nway through at a movement rate of 1 per \nround (or 2 if larger than man-sized). The \narea must contain brush and trees for this \nspell to work. Briars, bushes, creepers, \nlianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, \nvines, and weeds become thick and over- \ngrown so as to form a barrier. The area of \neffect is 10 feet on a side per level of experi- \nence of the caster, in any square or rectangu- \nlar shape that the caster desires. Thus an \n8th-level wizard can affect an 80’ X 80’ \nsquare, a 160’ x 40’ rectangle, a 640’ x 10’ \nrectangle, etc. Individual plant girth and \nhe& is generally affected less than thick- \nness of brush, branch, and undergrowth. \nThe spell’s effects persist in the area until it is \ncleared by labor, fire, or such magical \nmeans as a dispel magic spell. \nPlant Growth (Alteration \nRange 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \n. \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \n~~~~ \nPolymorph Other (Alteration) \nRange: 5 yards/lwel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nmagic that completely alters the form and \nability, and possibly the personality and \nmentality, of the recipient. of course, while \na creature with a lower Intelligence can be \npolymorphed in form into something with a \nhigher Intelligence, it will not gain that crea- \nture’s mental ability. The reverse-poly- \nmorphing a higher Intelligence creature into \none of significantly lower Intelligence- \nresults in a creature much more intelligent \nthan appearances would lead one to believe. \nThe polymorphed creature must succeed on \na system shock (see Table 3) roll to see if it \nsurvives the change. After this, it must \nmake a special Intelligence check to see if it \nretains its personality (see following). \nThe polymorphed creature acquires the \nfm4 apd physical abilities of the creature it \nbe& polymorphed into, while retaining \nnd. Form indudeo-natural Annor \ndue to skin toughness, but not \ndue t~ quickness, magical nature, etc.), \nphysic81 movement abilities (walking, \nswimming, fiishr with +, but not plane \nshifting, blinking, teleporting, etc.), and \nattack routines (daw/claw/bite, swoop, \nrake, constriction, but not petrifitation, \nbreath weapons, energy drain, etc.). Hit \npoints and saving throws do not change \nfrom the original form. Noncorporeal forms \ncannot be assumed. Natural shapeshifters \n(lycanthropes, dopplegangers, higher level \ndruids, etc.) are affected for but one round, \nand can then resume their normal form. \nIf slain, the polymorphed creature reverts \nto its original form (it‘s still dead, though). \n(Note that most creatures generally prefer \ntheir own form and will not willingly stand \nthe risk of being subjected to this spell!) As \nclass and level are not attributes of form, \nabilities derived from either cannot be \ngained by this spell, nor can exact ability \nscores be specified. \nWhen the polymorph occurs, the crea- \nture‘s equipment, if any, melds into the new \nform (in particularly challenging cam- \npaigns, the DM may allow protective \ndevices, such as a ring of protection, to con- \ntinue operating effectively). The creature \nretains its mental abilities, including spell \nuse, assuming the new form allows comple- \ntion of the proper verbal and somatic com- \nponents and the material components are \navailable. Creatures not used to a new form \nmight be penalized at the DM’s option (e.g., \n-2 to attack rolls) until they practice suffi- \nciently to master it. \nThe polymoTph other spell is a pow \nWhen the physical changeomim, then is \na base 100% chance that the subjects per- \nsonality and mentality cbngc into that of \nnew form (i.e., a roll of 20 or less on I-). \nFor each 1 point of IntelligeMc of the sub- \nject, subtract 1 from the base chance on \nI-. Additionally, for every Hit Die of dif- \nkrenue between the original form and the \nform it is assuming, add or sub- 1 \n(depending on whether polJnnorpbed fwm \nhas more Hit Dice [or leveis) or fewer Hit \nDice [or levels] than orisinal/ respetively). \nThe chance for assumption of the personali- \nty and mentality of the nrwJorm is checked \ndaily until the drange t9kes.place. \nA subject acquiring the mentality of the \nnew form has effectively become the crea- \nture whose form was assumed pnd comes \nunder the control of the DM until recovered \nby a wish SpeH or similar magic. Once this \nfinal change takes place, the creature \nacquires the new form‘s full range of magi- \ncal and special abilities. \nExample: If a 1 Hit Die orc of 8 Ink&- \ngence is polymorph4 into a white dragon \nwith 6 Hit Dice, for example, it is 8596 (20- \n8 Intelligence + 5 level d&kence 16-11 = 17 \nout of 20 = 85%) likely to actud€y become \none in allrespects, but in any case it has the \ndragon‘s physical and mental capabilities. If \nit daw not aalume the personality and men- \ntality of a white dragon, it ~QWS what it \nformerly hew as well. \nThe wizd can use a dispsi magic spell to \nchange the polymorphed creature back to \nits anginal from, and this requires a system \nshock roll. Those who have lost their indi- \nviduality and are then converted back main- \ntain the belief that they are actually the \npolymorphed creature and attempt to \nreturn to that form. Thus the orc who co~8 \nto believe he is a white dragon, when con- \nverted back to his orc form, ste-y \nmaintains he is really a white dragon poly- \nmorphed into the shape of an orc. His am- \npanions will most likely consider him mad. \nThe material component of this spell b a \ncaterpillar cocoon. \nPolymorph Self (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V \nDuration: 2 tumdlevel \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard IS auR \nto assume the hrm of any creature, save \nthose that are noncorporeal, from as small \nas a wren to as large as a hippopotamus. \nFurthermore, the wizard gains its physical \nmode of locomotion and breathing as well. \nNo system shock roll is required.
