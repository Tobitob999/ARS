    "text": "t I \nWizard Snells (2nd Levd\\ \nFwget (EnchantmenVChann) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the spell caste^ \ncauses creatures within the area of effect tc \nforget the events of the previous round (the \none minute of time previous to the utterance \nof the spell). For every three levels of experi- \nence of the spellcaster, another minute of \npast time is forgotten. This does not negate \ncham, suggestion, gem, quest, or similar \nspells, but it is possible that the being who \nplaced such magic upon the recipient could \nbe forgotten. From one to four creatures can \nbe affected, at the discretion of the caster. If \nonly one is to be affected, the recipient saves \nvs. spell with a -2 penalty; if two, they \nsave with - 1 penalties; if three or four are \nto be affected, they save normally. All sav- \ning throws are adjusted by Wisdom. A \npriest's heal or restoration spell, if specially \ncast for this purpose, will restore the lost \nmemories, as will a limited wish or wish, \nbut no other means will do so. \nGlitterdust (Conjuration/Sumrnoning) \nRange: 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell creates a cloud of glittering \ngolden particles within the area of effect. \nThose in the area must roll a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell or be blinded ( - 4 penal- \nties to attack rolls, saving throws, and \nArmor Class) for ld4 + 1 rounds. In addi- \ntion, all within the area are covered by the \ndust, which cannot be removed and con- \ntinues to sparkle until it fades. Note that this \nreveals invisible creatures. The dust fades in \nld4 rounds plus one round per caster level. \nThus glitterdust cast by a 3rd-level wizard \nlasts for four to seven rounds. \nThe material component is ground mica. \nHypnotic Pattern (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: %foot cube \nSavingThrow: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard Creates \na weaving, twisting pattern of subtle colors \nin the air. This pattern causes any creature \nlooking at it to become fascinated and stand \ngazing at it as long as the spellcaster main \ntains the display, plus two rounds there \nafter. The spell can captivate a maximum o \n24 levels, or Hit Dice, of creatures (e.g., 21 \ncreatures with 1 Hit Die each, 12 with 2 Hii \nDice, etc). All creatures affected must bc \nwithin the area of effect, and each is entitlec \nto a saving throw vs. spell. A damage \ninflicting attack on an affected creature fre \nit from the spell immediately. \nThe mage need not utter a sound, but he \nmust gesture appropriately while holding a \nglowing stick of incense or a crystal rod \nfilled with phosphorescent material. \nImproved Phantasmal Force \n(Illusion/Phantasrn) \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 200 sq. ft./ + 50 sq.ft./level \nSaving Throw: Special \nLike the 1st-level phantasmal force spell, \nthis spell creates the illusion of any object, \ncreature, or force, as long as it is within the \nspell's area of effect. The spellcaster can \nmaintain the illusion with minimal concen- \ntration, thus he can move at half normal \nspeed (but not cast other spells).. Some mi- \nlor sounds are included in the effects of the \nipell, but not understandable speech. Also, \n,he improved phantasm continues for two \neounds after the wizard ceases to concen- \nrate upon it. \nThe material component is a bit of fleece. \nInvisibility (Illusion/Phantasrn) \ntange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nZasting Time: 2 \n4rea of Effect: Creature touched \nsaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes the creature touched to \nranish from sight and be undetectable by \niormal vision or even infravision. Of \n:ourse, the invisible creature is not magi- \n:ally silenced, and certain other conditions \n*an render the creature detectable. Even al- \nies cannot see the invisible creature or his \n;ear, unless these allies can normally see in- \nrisible things or employ magic to do so. \ntems dropped or put down by the invisible \nreature become visible, items picked up \n'isappear if tucked into the clotlung or \nouches worn by the creature. Note, how- \nver, that light never becomes invisible, al- \n~ough a source of light can become so (thus \nie effect is that of a light with no visible \nsource). \nThe spell remains in effect until it is magi- \ncally broken or dispelled, until the wizard \nor recipient cancels it, until the recipient at- \ntacks any creature, or until 24 hours have \npassed. Thus the invisible being can open \ndoors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he \nattacks, he immediately becomes visible, al- \nthough the invisibility enables him to attack \nfirst. Note that the clerical bless, chmt, and \nprayer spells are not attacks for this pur- \npose. All highly Intelligent (Int 13 or more) \ncreatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels \nof experience have a chance to detect invisi- \nble objects (they roll saving throws vs. spell; \nsuccess means they noticed the invisible ob- \nject). \nThe material components of the inuisibil- \nity spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum ara- \nbic, the former encased in the latter. \nIrritation (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 4 creatures in a 15-foot- \nradius area \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nAn im'fation spell affects the epidermis of \nthe subject creatures. Creatures with very \nihick or insensitive skins (such as buffalo, \nrlephants, scaled Creatures, etc.) are basi- \n:ally unaffected by this. There are two ver- \niions of the spell, either of which can be cast \n'rom the standard preparation: \nItching. When cast, this causes each sub- \nect to feel an instant itching sensation on, \n,ome portion of its body. If one round is not \nrnmediately spent scratching the irritated \nrea, the creatw is so affected that the next \nhree rounds are spent squirming and twist- \nng, effectively worsening its Armor Class by \n1 and its attack rolls by 2 during this time. \nSpell preparations are ruined in the first \nsound this spell is in effect, but not in the fol- \nowing three rounds. Doing nothing but \nmatching the itch for a full round prevents \nhe rest of the effect. If cast at one creature, \nhe saving throw has a -3 penalty; if cast at \nwo creatures, the saving throw has a -1 \nmalty; and if cast at three or four Creatures, \nhe saving throw is normal. \nRash. When a rash is cast, the subject no- \nices nothing for ld4 rounds, but thereafter \nts entire skin breaks out in red welts that \ntch. The rash persists until either a cure dis- \nuse or dispel magic spell is cast upon it. It \n3wers Charisma by 1 point per day for each \nf four days (i.e.f maximum Charisma loss \ni 4 points). After one week, Dexterity is \n>wered by 1 point also. Symptoms vanish \nnmediately upon the removal of the rash, \nnd all statistics return to normal. This can \ne cast at one creature only, with a saving \nwow penalty of - 2. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsaf from poison ivy, oak, or sumac \n142"
