    "text": "Combat (Initiative) \nI \naction down into more individual initia- \ntives. However, the general method of de- \ntermining initiative remains the same in all \ncases. \nStandard Initiative Procedure \nTo determine the \ninitiative order for a round of combat, roll \nIdlo for each side in the battle. Normally, \nthis means the DM rolls for the monsters (or \nNPCs), while one of the players rolls for the \nPC party. Low roll wins initiative. If more \nthan two sides are involved in combat, the \nremaining sides act in ascending order of \ninitiative. \nIf both (or all) sides roll the same number \nfor initiative, everything happens sim- \nultaneously-all attack rolls, damage, \nspells, and other actions are completed be- \nfore any results are applied. It is possible for \na mage to be slain by goblins who collapse \nfrom his sleep spell at the end of the round. \nInitiative Modifiers \nSituational factors \ncan affect who has initiative. To reflect this, \nmodifiers are added to or subtracted from \nthe initiative die roll. \nTable 5% SWDARD MODIFIERS \nTO INITIATIVE \nSpecific Situation Modifier \nHasted -2 \nSlowed +2 \nOn higher ground -1 \nSet to receive a charge -2 \nWading or slippery footing +2 \nWading in deep water +4 \nForeign environment* +6 \nHindered (tangled, climbing, held) +3 \nWaiting (seep. 112) +l \nThis applies to situations in which the \nparty is in a completely different environ- \nment (swimming underwater without the \naid of a ring of free movement, for exam- \nple). \nEveryone in the party who will be in- \nvolved in the round's action must qualify \nfor the modifier. For example, all members \nof a party must be on higher ground than \nthe opposition in order to get the higher \nground modifier. The DM will probably ask \neach player where his character is standing \nin order to clarify this. \nThe side with the lowest modified roll on \nIdlo has the initiative and acts first. \nContinuing the example above, the DM \ndecides that one initiative roll is sufficient \nfor each group and no modifiers are needed \nfor either group. (Although Rath is charg- \ning, the orcs and trolls are too busy rear- \nranging their lines to be set to receive his \ncharge and so the -2 to receive charge is not \nused.) \nHarry, rolling for the player characters, \ngets a 7on a 10-sided die. The DM rolls a 10. \nThe player characters, having the lowest \nnumber, act first. \nDelsenona's acid arrow strikes one of the \ntrolls just as Rath takes a swing at the last of \nthe fleeing orcs. A bowshot from Rupert \ndrops another one of the creatures as it takes \nits position in the second rank. Now the \nmonsters strike back. \nThe orcs manage to fineh forming their \nline. Enraged by the acid, the lead troll tears \ninto Rath, hurting him badly. The others \nswarm around him, attempting to tear him \nlimb from limb. \n- \nTable 56: OPTIONAL MODIFIERS \nSpecific Situation \nAttacking with weapon \nBreath weapon \nCasting a spell \nCreature size (Monsters attacking \nwith natural weapons only)* \nTiny \nSmall \nMedium \nLarge \nHuge \nGargantuan \nInnate spell ability \nMagical Items** \nMiscellaneous Magic \nPotion \nRing \nRods \nScroll \nStave \nWand \neveryone on the same side is too unreal \nistic.
