Any creatures \nobserving the fire or the dancing circle of \nflame around it must successfully roll a sav- \ning throw vs. spell or be charmed into \nremainii motionless and gazing, trans- \nfixed, at the flames. While so charmed, \ncreatures are subject to suggestions of 12 or \nfewer words, saving vs. spell with a - 3 pen- \nalty, adjusted for Wisdom. The caster can \ngive one such suggestion to each creature, \nand the suggestions need not be the same. \nThe maximum duration for such a sugges- \ntion is one hour, regardless of the caster’s \nlwel. \nThe fire charm is broken if the charmed \ncreature is physically attacked, if a solid \nobject comes between the creature and the \nveil of flames so as to obstruct vision, or \nwhen the duration of the spell expires. \nThose exposed to the fire charm again may \nbe affected at the DMs option, although \nbonuses may also be allowed to the saving \nthrows. Note that the veil of flame is not a \nmagical fire, and passing through it incurs \nthe same damage as would be sustained \nfrom passing through its original fire \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall piece of multi-colored silk of excep- \ntional thinness that the spellcaster must \nthrow into the fire source. \nRange: 10 yards \nsource. \nFire Shield (Evocation, Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level \nCastinn Time: 4 \n. Area 01 ~ect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell can be cast in one of two \nforms: a warm shield that protects against \ncold-based attacks, or a chill shield that pro- \ntects against fire-based attacks. Both return \ndamage to creatures making physical \nattacks against the wizard. The wizard must \nchoose which variation he memorizes when \nthe spell is selected. \nWhen casting this spell, the wizard \nappears to immolate himself, but the flames \nare thin and wispy, shedding no heat, \nthough giving light equal to only half the \nillumination of a normal torch. The color of \nthe flames is determined randomly (50% \nchance of either color)-blue or green if the \nchill shield is cast, violet or blue if the warm \nshield is employed. The special powers of \neach shield are as follows: \nA) Warm shield. The flames are warm to \nthe touch. Any cold-based attacks are saved \nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal \ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is \nno bonus against fire-based attacks, but if \nthe wizard fails to make the required saving \nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains \ndouble normal damage. \nThe material component for this varia- \ntion is a bit of phosphorus. \nB) Chill shield. The flames are cool to the \ntouch. Any fire-based attacks are saved \nagainst with a +2 bonus; either half normal \ndamage or no damage is sustained. There is \nno bonus against cold-based attacks, but if \nthe wizard fails to make the required saving \nthrow (if any) against them, he sustains \ndouble normal damage. \nThe material component for this varia- \ntion is a live firefly or glow worm or the tail \nportions of four dead ones. \nAny creature striking the spellcaster with \nits body or hand-held weapons inflicts nor- \nmal damage upon the wizard, but the \nattacker suffers the same amount of dam- \nage. An attacker‘s magical resistance, if any, \nis tested when the creature actually strikes \nthe wizard. Successful resistance shatters \nthe spell. Failure means the creature’s magic \nresistance does not affect that casting of the \nSpell. \nFlre map (Abjuration, Evocation) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until discharged \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Object touched \nSaving Throw: 112 \nAny closeable item (book, box, bottle, \nchest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so \nforth) can be warded by a fire trap spell. The \nspell is centered on a point selected by the \nspellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have \na second closure or warding spell placed \nupon it (if such is attempted, the result is \n25% first spell fails, 25% second spell fails, \nor 50% both spells fail). A knock spell does \nnot afkct a fire trap in any way-as soon as \nthe offending party enters or touches the \nitem, the trap discharges. Thieves and oth- \ners have only 1/2 of their normal chance to \ndetect a fire trap (by noticing the character- \nistic markings required to cast the spell). \nThey have only 1h their normal chance to \nmove the trap (failure detonates the trap \nimmediately). An unsuccessful dispel does \nnot detonate the spell. The caster can use the \ntrapped object without discharging it, as \ncan any individual to whom the sue11 was \nspecifically attuned when cast (the exact \nmethod usually involves a keyword). When \nthe trap is discharged, there is an explosion \nof five-foot radius from the spell’s center; all \ncreatures within this area must roll saving \nthrows vs. spell. Damage is ld4 points plus \n1 point per level of the caster; half this \n(round up) for creatures successfully saving. \n(Underwater, this ward inflicts half damage \nand creates a large cloud of steam.) The item \ntrapped is not harmed by this explosion. \nTo place this spell, the caster must trace \nthe outline of the closure with a bit of sul- \nphur or saltpeter and touch the center of the \neffect. Attunement to another individual \nrequires a hair or similar object from that \nperson. \nFumble (EnchantmenKharm) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a fumble spell is cast, the wizard \ncreates an area in which all creatures sud- \ndenly become clumsy and awkward. Run- \nning creatures trip and fall, those reaching \nfor an item drop it, those employing weap- \nons likewise awkwardly drop them, etc. \nRecovery from a fall or to pick up a fumbled \nobject typically requires a successful saving \nthrow and takes one round. Note that \nbreakable items might suffer damage when \ndropped. A subject succeeding with his sav- \ning throw can act freely that round, but if he \nis in the area at the beginning of the next \nround, another saving throw is required. \nAlternatively, the spell can be cast at an \nindividual creature. Failure to save means \nthe creature is affected for the spell’s entire \nduration; success means the creature is \nslowed (see the 3rd-level spell). \nThe material component of this spell is a \ndab of solidified milk fat. \nHdluclnatory Terrdn \n(IUusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Cube up to 30’ per side/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard causes \nan illusion that hides the actual terrain with- \nin the area of effect. Thus open fields or a \nroad can be made to look like a swamp, hill, \ncrevasse, or some other difficult or impass- \nable terrain. A pond can be made to look \nlike a grassy meadow, a precipice look like a \ngentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully made to \n1"
