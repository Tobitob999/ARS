Check \nwith your DM upon reaching 9th level. \nA fighter can hold property, including a \ncastle or stronghold, long before he reaches \n9th level. However, it Is only when he reach- \nes this level that his name is so widely \nknown that he attracts the loyalty of other \nwarriors. \n66-99 \nAbility Requirements: Strength 12 \nConstitution 9 \nWisdom 13 \nCharisma 17 \nPrime Requisites: Strength, \nCharisma \nRaces Allowed: Human \nideals that he must maintain at all tim \nThroughout legend and history the \nmany heroes who could be called \ndins: Roland and the 12 Peers of C \nmagne, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, a \nGalahad are all examples of the \nHowever, many brave and heroic s \ndiers have tried and failed to live up \nthe ideals of the paladin. It is not an e \ntask! \nOnly a human may become a paladin. He \nmust have minimum ability scores of \nStrength 12, Constitution 9, Wisdom 13, \nand Charisma 17. Strength and Charisma \nare the prime requisites of the paladin. A \npaladin must be lawful good in alignment \nand must always remain lawful good. A \npaladin who changes alignment, either \ndeliberately or inadvertently, loses all his \nspecial powers-sometimes only temporari- \nly and sometimes forever. He can use any \nweapon and wear any type of armor. \nA paladin who has Strength and Cha- \nrisma scores of 16 or more gains a 10 percent \nbonus to the experience points he earns. \nLawfulness and good deeds are the meat \nand drink of a paladin. If a paladin ever \nknowingly performs a chaotic act, he must \nseek a high-level (7th or more) cleric of law- \nful good alignment, confess his sin, and do \npenance as prescribed by the cleric. If a pal- \nadin should ever knowingly and willingly \nperform an evil act, he loses the status of \npaladinhood immediately and irrevocably. \nAll benefits are then lost and no deed or \nmagic can restore the character to pala- \ndinhood: He is ever after a fighter. The \ncharacter's level remains unchanged when \nthis occurs and experience points are adjust- \ned accordingly. Thereafter the character is \nbound by the rules for fighters. He does not \ngain the benefits of weapon specialization (i€ \nthis is used) since he did not select this for \nhis character at the start. \nIf the paladin commits an evil act while \nenchanted or controlled by magic, he loses \nhis paladin status until he can atone for the \ndeed. This loss of status means the character \nloses all his special abilities and essentially \nfunctions as a fighter (without weapon spe- \ncialization) of the same level. Regaining his \nstatus undoubtedly requires completion of \nsome dangerous quest or important mission \nto once again prove his worth and assuage \nhis own guilt. He gains no expzience prior \nto or during the course of this mission, and \nregains his standing as a paladin only upon \ncompleting the quest. \nA paladin has the following special bene- \nfits: \nA paladin can detect the presence of evil \nintent up to 60 feet away by concentrating \non locating evil in a particular direction. He \ncan do this as often as desired, but each \nattempt takes one round. This ability \ndetects evil monsters and characters. \nA paladin receives a + 2 bonus to PH sav- \ning throws \nA paladin is immune to all forms of dir- \nease. (Note that certain magical afflic- \ntions-lycanthropy and mummy rot-are \ncurses and not diseases.) \nA paladin can heal by laying on hands. \nThe paladin restores 2 hit points per ex&- \nence level. He can heal himself or someom \nelse, but only once per day. \nA paladin can cure diseases of all sorts \n(though not cursed afflictions such as lycan- \nthropy). This can be done only once per \nweek for each five levels of experience (once \nper week at levels 1 through 5, twice per \nweek at levels 6 through 10, etc.). \nA paladin is sumunded by an aura of \nprotection with a IGfoot radius. Within \nthis radius, all summoned and specifically \nevil creatures suffer a -1 penalty to their \nattack rolls, regardless of whom they \nattack. Creatures affected by this aura can \nspot its source easily, even if the paladin is \ndisguised. \nA paladin using a Jtofj- sword projects a \ncircle of power 30 feet in diameter when the \nsword is unsheathed and held. This power \ndispels hostile magic of a level up to the pal- \nadin's experience level. (A holy sword is a \nvery special weapon; if your paladin \n27"
