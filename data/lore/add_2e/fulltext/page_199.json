    "text": "hiest Spells Note \nFollowing the name \nof each priest spell, notice that a magical \nschool is given in parentheses. This is #or \nderence purposes only. For instance, Wis- \ndom bonuses apply to saving throws vs. \nenchantment/charm spells. If the appropri- \nate magical school were not listed with \npriest spells, it would be hard to figure out \nwhich spells were considered to be \nenchantment/charms. There are a few other \nreasons one might need to know this infor- \nmation. The priest spells are not really orga- \nnized into magical schools, but rather into \nspheres of influence, as described on page 34 \nand in Chapter 7 Magic. \nSee Appendix 2 on page 129 for explana- \ntions of what the spell parameters (Range, \nComponents, etc:) mean. \n6: \nFirstmLevel Spells \nAnimal Friendship \n(EnchantmenKharm) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 hour \nArea of Effect: 1 animal \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nshow any animal of animal intelligence to \nsemi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that \nhe desires friendship. If the animal does not \nroll a successful saving throw vs. spell im- \nmediately when the spell is begun, it stands \nquietly while the caster finishes the spell. \nThereafter, it follows the caster about. The \nspell functions only if the caster actually \nwishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster \nhas ulterior motives, the animal always \nsenses them (e.g., the caster intends to eat \nthe animal, send it ahead to set off traps, \netc.). \nThe caster can teach the befriended ani- \nmal three specific tricks or tasks for each \npoint of Intelligence it possesses. Typical \ntasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet \n(i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for \neach such trick must be done over a period \nof one week, and all must be done within \nthree months of acquiring the creature. Dur- \ning the three-month period, the animal will \nnot harm the caster, but if the creature is left \nalone for more than a week, it will revert to \nits natural state and act accordingly. \nThe caster can use this spell to attract up \nto 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience \nlevel he possesses. This is also the maximum \ntotal Hit Dice of the animals that can be at- \ntracted and trained at one time: no more \nthan twice the caster's experience level. \nOnly unaligned animals can be attracted, \nbefriended, and trained. \nThe material components of this spell are \nthe caster's holy symbol and a piece of food \nthe animal likes. \n61- (Conjuration6ummoning) \nReversible \nSphere: All \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V. S, M \nDuration: 6 rounds \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 50-fOOt cube \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon uttering the bless spell, the caster \nraises the morale of friendly creatures and \nany saving throw rolls they make against \nfear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises \ntheir attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, \nhowever, affects only those not already en- \ngaged in melee combat. The caster deter- \nmines at what range (up to 60 yards) he wilI \ncast the spell. At the instant the spell is com- \npleted, it affects all creatures in a ScFfoOt \ncube centered on the point selected by the \ncaster (thus, affected creatures leaving the \narea are still subject to the spell's effect; \nthose entering the area after the cas- is \ncompleted are not). \nA second use of this spell is to bless a sin- \ngle item (for example, a crossbow bolt for \nuse against a rakshasa). The weight of the \nitem is limited to one pound per caster level \nand the effect lasts until the item is used or \nthe spell duration ends. \nMultiple bless spells are not cumulative. \nIn addition to the verbal and somatic ges- \nture components, the bless spell requires \nholy water. \nThis spell can be reversed by the priest to \na curse spell upon enemy creatures that \nlowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. \nThe curse requires the sprinkling of unholy \nwater. \nCombine (Evocation) \nSphere: All \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: The circle of priests \nSaving Throw: None \nUsing this spell, three to five priests com- \nbine their abilities so that one of them casts \nspells and tums undead at an enhanted \nlevel. The highest level priest (or one of \nthem, if two or more are tied for highest) \nstands alone, while the others join hands in \na surrounding circle. The central priest casts \nthe combine spell. He temporarily gains one \nlevel for each priest in the circle, up to a \nmaximum gain of four levels. The level in- \ncrease affects turning undead apd spdl de- \ntails that vary with the caster's level. Note \nthat the central priest gains no additional \nspells and that the group is limited to his \ncurrently memorized spells. \nThe encircling priests must concentrate \non maintaining the combine effect. They \nlose all Armor Class bonuses for shicld and \nDexterity. If any of them has his concentra- \ntion broken, the combine spell did- \nately. If the combine spell is broken while \nthe central priest is in the act of casting a \nspell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster \nwas disturbed. Spells cast in combination \nhave the full enhanced effect, even if the \ncombine is broken before the duration of \nthe enhanced spell ends. Note that the com- \nbination is not broken if only the central \ncaster is disturbed."
