    "text": "Equipment (Encumbrance) \nattacks of the user's choice. \nThe medium shield is carried in the same \nmanner as the small shield. Its weight pre- \nvents the character from using his shield \nhand for other purposes. With a medium \nshield, a character can protect against any \nfrontal or flank attacks. \nThe body shield is a massive shield reach- \ning nearly from chin to toe. It must be firmly \nfastened to the forearm and the shield hand \nmust grip it at all times. It provides a great \ndeal of protection, improving the Armor \nClass of the character by 1 against melee \nattacks and by 2 against missile attacks, for \nattacks from the front or front flank sides. It \nis very heavy; the DM may wish to use the \noptional encumbrance system if he allows \nthis shield. \nSplint Mail: The existence of this armor \nhas been questioned. It is claimed that the \narmor is made of narrow vertical strips riv- \neted to a backing of leather and cloth pad- \nding. Since this is not flexible, the joints are \nprotected by chain mail. \nStudded leather: This armor is made \nfrom leather (not hardened as with normal \nleather armor) reinforced with close-set \nmetal rivets. In some ways it is very similar \nto brigandine, although the spacing \nbetween each metal piece is greater. \nIn addition to the types of armor listed \nabove, your DM may have special armors \nprepared from rare or exotic materials. \nSince it is highly unlikely that your charac- \nter can afford these at the start, the DM will \ntell you when you need to know about such \nitems. \nArmor Sizes \nThe equipment list reflects the price of a \nsuit of armor (including an appropriate hel- \nmet) made for any normal player character \nrace. Although a halfling is much smaller \nthan a human and needs a smaller suit, there \nare fewer armorers available to meet such \nspecialized needs. Thus the armor for a half- \nling is as expensive as that for a human. \nArmdr for nonstandard sizes and shapes is \ngoing to cost significantly more and must be \ncustom-made. This is not the kind of thing \none can pick up at the local storef \nWhen armor is found during the course of \nan adventure, the players should note the \ncreature who wore the armor previously. \nWhile a human-sized character might be \nable to wear the armor of a gnoll, it will do \nlittle good for a halfling. Likewise, the \narmor of a giant is of little use to anyone. \nArmor size also affects the weight of the \narmor, if the optional encumbrance system \nis used. The weights listed on the table are \nfor human-sized (Medium) armors. Small \narmor weighs half the amount listed, while \nlarge armor weighs 50% more. \nGetting Into and Out of Armor \nThere are times when it is important to \nknow how quickly a character can get into \nor out of his armor. Accidents and unfore- \nseen events happen all the time. The party is \nattacked at night. Those sleeping around the \ncampfire may want to don their armor \nbefore rushing into battle. A character slips \nand falls into the river where his heavy \narmor pulls him down like a stone. He \ngreatly desires to get it off before he drowns. \nJust how long does it take him? \nThe time required to don armor depends \non its make. Those armors that are a single \npiece-leather tunics, robes, chain mail- \ntake one round (two for metal items) to don \nwith slight assistance. Without aid, the time \nis doubled. Armor that is made of separate \npieces requires ld6 + 4 rounds, again with \nassistance. Without help, the time required \nis tripled. In all cases, the times given \nassume that the proper undergarments and \npadding are also worn. \nSometimes characters need to get into \narmor in a hurry and thus they dress hastily. \nThis assumes that some buckles aren't fas- \ntened, seatings adjusted, etc. Single suits \ncan be hastily donned in one round at the \ncost of 1 worse AC (though never worse \nthan 8). Thus, a fighter could hastily pull on \nhis brigandine jack (AC 6) and charge into a \nfray with an AC of 7. Hastily donning piece \narmor (plate mail for example) improves the \ncharacter's AC by 1 (from a base of 10) for \nevery round spent dressing. A fighter could \nchoose to spend three rounds fitting on \nparts of his plate mail, giving him an AC of \n7, before going into battle. \nRemoving armor is a much quicker matter. \nMost can be shed in a single round. Piece \narmor (particularly full plate) requires ld4 + \n1 raunds. However, if the character is willing \nto cut straps and bend pins, such armors can \nbe removed in half the time (roll ld4+1, \ndivide by 2, then round fractions up). \nCreatures with Natural Armor Classes \nSome creatures possess a natural Armor \nClass already superior to some of the armor \ntypes (for example, the horse is AC 7). \nHowever, these creatures can still benefit \nfrom wearing armor of a quality worse than \ntheir natural Armor Class. If the AC of \narmor is equal to or worse than the AC of \nthe creature, the AC of the creature \nimproves by 1. \nFor example, a horse has a natural AC of \n7. The AC of leather armor is 8, worse than \nthe horse's natural AC. However, if a horse \nis fitted with leather barding, its AC drops \nto 6 since it gains the benefit of the addition- \nal protection. \ncumbrance \nptional Rule) \nthe worse the charac- \nTable 47: CHARACTER ENCUMBRANCE \nCharacter Encumbrance \nMax. \ncarried \n8-9 0-35 36-50 51-65 66-80 81-90 90 \n220 \n255 \n17 13-85 86-121 122-157 158-193 194-220 \n18 0-110 111-149 150-188 189-227 228-255 \n76"
