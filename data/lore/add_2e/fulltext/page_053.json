A player character could be- \ncome proficient with a long bow or a short \nbow, but not with all bows in general (unless \nhe devotes a proficiency slot to each individ- \nually). Furthermore, a character can assign \nweapon proficiency slots only to those weap- \nons allowed to his character class. \nAs a character reaches higher experience \nlevels, he also earns additional weapon pro- \nficiencies. The rate at which proficiencies \nare gained depends on the character's class. \nWarriors, who concentrate on their martial \nskills, learn to handle a great number of \nweapons. They gain weapon proficiencies \nquickly. Wizards, who spend their time \nstudying forgotten magical acts, have little \ntime to practice with weapons. They gain \nadditional weapon proficiencies very \nslowly. Multi-class characters can use the \nmost beneficial line on Table 34 to determine \ntheir initial proficiencies and when they gain \nnew proficiencies. \nEffects of Weapon hoficlencin \nA character who \nhas a specific weapon proficiency is skilled \nwith that weapon and familiar with its use. \nA character does not gain any bonuses for \nusing a weapon he is proficient with; the \ncombat rules and attack chances assume \nthat everyone uses a weapon he is proficient \nwith. This eliminates the need to add a mod- \nifier to every die roll during battle. \nWhen a character uses a weapon that he is \nnot proficient with, however, he suffers a \npenalty on his chance to hit. The size of this \npenalty depends on the character's class. \nWarriors have the smallest penalty because \nthey are assumed to have passing familiarity \nwith all weapons. Wizards, by comparison, \nare heavily penalized because of their lim- \nited study of weapons. The modifiers for \neach class (which are taken as penalties to \nthe'attack die roll) are listed on Table 34. \nRelated Weapons Bonus \nWhen a character \ngains a weapon proficiency, he is learning to \nuse a particular weapon effectively. How- \never, many weapons have similar character- \nistics. A long sword, bastard sword, and \nbroad sword, while all different, are all \nheavy, slashing swords. A character who is \ntrained with one can apply some of his skill \nto the others. He is not fully proficieot with \nthe weapon, but he knows more about it \nthan someone who picks it up without any \nskill in similar weapons. \nWhen a character uses a weapon that is \nsimilar to a weapon he is proficient with, his \nattack penalty is only one-half the normal \namount (rounded up). A warrior, for exam- \nple, would have a. - 1 penalty with a related \nweapon instead of -2. A wizard would \nhave a -3 penalty instead of -5. \nSpecific decisions about which weapons \nare related are left to the DM. Some likely \ncategories are: \nhand axe, battle axe; \nshort bow, long bow, composite bow; \nheavy and light crossbows- \ndagger, knife; \nglaive, halberd, bardiche, voulge, \nguisarme, glaive-guisarme, guisarme- \nvoulge; \nharpoon, spear, trident, javelin; \nfootman's mace, horseman's mace, morn- \ning star, flail, hammer, club; \nmilitary fork, ranseur, spetum, partisan; \nscimitar, bastard sword, long sword, \nbroad sword; \nsling, staff sling \nWeapon Speclrllutlon \nKnowing how to \nuse a weapon without embarrassing your- \nself is very different from being a master of \nthat weapon. There are warriors, and then \nthere are martial artists. An Olympic fencer \nis more than just an athlete; he can do things \nwith his weapon that astound most fencers. \nIn the AD&W game, part of your charac- \nter's skill is reflected in the bonuses he.earns \nas he reaches higher levels. As your charac- \nter advances, he becomes a wiser, more dan- \ngerous fighter. Experience has taught him to \nanticipate his opponents and to pounce on \nany advantage that presents itself. But this \nis a general, overall improvement, brought \nabout by the warrior's sharpening senses \nand timing. It applies equally to all types of \nfighting. \nWeapon specialization is an optional rule \nthat enables a fighter (only) to choose a sin- \ngle weapon and specialize in its use. Any \nweapon may be chosen. Specialization is \nnormally announced (and paid for with \nweapon proficiency slots) when the charac- \nter is created. But even after a player charac- \nter earns experience, he can still choose to \nspecialize in a weapon, provided he \n52 \nhas the weapon proficiency slots available. \nIn one way, a weapon specialist is like a \nwizard specialist. The specialization re- \nquires a single-minded dedication and train- \ning. Thus multi-class characters cannot use \nweapon specialization; it is available only to \nsingle-class fighters. \nCost of Specialization \nWeapon specialization is obtained by de- \nvoting extra weapon proficiency slots to the \nchosen weapon. To specialize in any sort of \nmelee weapon or crossbow, the character \nmust devote two slots-one slot to become \nproficient with it, and then a second slot to \nspecialize in it. Any bow (other than a cross- \nbow) requires a total of three proficiency \nslots: one for proficiency and two to spe- \ncialize. Assume, for the moment, that Rath \nthe dwarf decided to speciaIize with the \nwarhammer. Two of his four proficiency \nslots are thus devoted to the warhammer. \nWith the two remaining, he can become \nproficient with the short sword and short \nbow (for example). \nEffects of Specialization \nWhen a character specializes with a melee \nweapon, he gains a +1 bonus to all his at- \ntack rolls with that weapon and a +2 bonus \nto all damage rolls (in addition to bonuses \nfor Strength and magic). The attack bonuses \nare not magical and do not enable the char- \nacter to affect a creature that can be injured \nonry by magical weapons. \nBow and crossbow specialists gain an ad- \nditional range category: point blank. \nPoint-blank range for bows is from six feet \nto 30 feet. Point-blank range for crossbows \nis from six feet to 60 feet. At point-blank \nrange, the character gains a +2 modifier on \nattack rolls. No additional damage is \ncaused, but Strength (for bows) and magical \nbonuses apply. Furthermore, if the charac- \nter has an arrow nocked and drawn, or a \nbolt loaded and cocked, and has his target in \nsight, he can fire at the beginning of the. \nround before any initiative rolls are made. \nFighters who specialize also gain extra at- \ntacks earlier than those who don't specid- \nize. Bonus attacks for specialists are listed \non Table 35. The use of this table is ex- \nplained in Chapter 9: Combat. Bow special- \nists do not gain any additional attacks per \nround. \nNonweapon Proficiencies \nA player character \nis more than a collection of combat modi- \nfiers. Most people have a variety of skills \nlearned over the years. Consider yourself as \nan example-how many skills do you pos- \nsess? If you have gone through 12 years of \nschool, were moderately active in after- \nschool programs, and did fairly well on \nyour grades, the following might be a par- \n*. \nI"
