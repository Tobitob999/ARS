Up to one creature per experi- \nence level of the caster can be influenced, \nprovided that all subject creatures are with- \nin the -yard range. Undead are not subjed \nto this spell. The suggestion must be reason- \nably worded and understood by the crea- \ntures, and must be the same for all hearing \nit. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are \nunaffected. Saving throws against the spell \nsuffer a penalty of - 1, and if a single crea- \nture is to be affected, its saving throw suf- \nfers a -4 penalty. Note that a very \nreasonable mass suggestion can cause the \nsaving throw to be made with an additional \npenalty (such as - 1, -2, etc.) at the discre- \ntion of your DM. A mass suggestion can \ncontinue in effect for a considerable dura- \ntion, at the DMs discretion. Conditions that \nwill trigger a special action can also be speci- \nfied; if the condition is not met before the \nspell expires, then the action will not be per- \nformed. \nThe material components of this spell are \na snake's tongue and either a bit of honey- \ncomb or a drop of sweet oil. \nMirage Arcma \n(Illualon/F'hantasm, Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S,(M optional) \nDuration: Special \nC+$ng Time: Special \nha of Effect: 10 feet/level radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThe magic of this spell is similar to that of \nthe oucuncy spell, only this is more power- \nful and elaborate. The spell enables the cast- \ner to make an area appear to be something \nother than it is, a setting he has personally \nseen. The spell remains as long as the caster \nmaintains a minimal concentration upon it. \nEven after this, the speIl persists for a total \nof one hour plus one additional turn for \neach experience level of the caster. (Note: \nMinimal concentration can be maintained \nduring normal conversation but not while \nspellcasting, in melee, or if harmed by an \nattack.) If the caster actually uses a small bit \nof anything connected with the place to cre- \nate this spell, then it takes on a quasi-reality. \nIn its basic form, forceful contact is neces- \nsary to have any hope of discovering the \nmagic, short of a detection device or spell. \nIn its more complex form, where a material \ncomponent is used, detection is possible \nonly by some magical means, whether \ndevice, item, or spell. Either form of mirage \narcana is subject to the dispel magic spell. \nAs with all powerful illusions, the mind \nof the believer urges appropriate effects \nupon the viewer's body. Under the influence \nof the spell, the viewer could possibly walk \nacross a bed of hot coals thinking it was a \nshallow stream of water that was cooling his \nfeet (and thus suffer no damage), dine upon \nimaginary food and actually be satisfied, or \nrest comfortably upon a bed of sharp \nstones, thinking it a featherbed. Gravity is \nnot affected by the spell, however, so that \nan envisioned bridge spanning a deep chasm \ndoes not support the believer. Those who \nwitness the event see it as a sudden disap- \npearance of the individual. They do not \nconnect it with an illusion unless they are \notherwise aware of some magic at work. \nMislead (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponent: S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special . \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a mislead spell is cast by the wiz- \nard, he actually creates an illusory double at \nthe same time that he is cloaked by \nimproved invisibility magic (see the 4th- \nlevel spell). The wizard is then free to go \nelsewhere while his double seemingly moves \naway. The spell enables the illusion of the \nwizard to speak and gesture as if it were \nreal, and there are full olfactory and touch \ncomponents as well. A tnre seeing spell or a \ngem of seeing will reveal the illusion for \nwhat it is. A detect invisibility or true seeing \nspell, or items such as a gem of seeing or \nrobe of eyes can detect the invisible wizard \n(see the 5th-level wizard spell, shadow \ndoor). \nMonster Summoning IV \n(Conjuration/Summoning)g) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld3 4th-level monsters. These \nappear within spell range and attack the \ncaster's opponents, until he commands them \nto cease, the spell duration expires, or the \nmonsters are slam. These creatures do not \n179 179 \n- \ncheck morale; they vanish when slain. If no \nopponent exists to fight, summoned mon- \nsters can, if the wizard can communicate \nwith them, and if they are physically capit- \nble, perform other services for the summon- \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessrrily lit) \ncandle. \ning wizard. \nMordenkdnen's Lucubfatlon \n(Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy use of this spell, the wizard is able to \ninstantly recall any 1st- through sth-level \nspell he has used during the past 24 hours. \nThe spell must have been memorized and \nactually used during that time period. Mor- \ndenkainen's lucubration allows the recovery \nof only one spell. If the recalled spell \nrequires material components, these must \nbe provided by the caster; the rec~ved \nspell is not usable until the material compo- \nnents are available. \nMove Earth (Alteration) \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen cast, the move earth spe~ moves \ndirt (clay, loam, sand) and its other compo- \nnents. Thus embankments can be collapsed, \nhillocks moved, dunes shifted, etc. How- \never, in no event can rock prominences be \ncollapsed or moved. The area to be affected \ndictates the casting time; for every 40 yd. x \n40 yd. surface area and 10 feet of depth, one \nturn of casting time is required. The maxi- \nmum area that can be affected is 240 yd. x \n240 yd., which takes four hours. If terrain \nfeatures are to be moved-as compared to \nsimply caving in banks or walls of earth-it \nis necessary that an earth elemental be sub- \nsequently summoned to assist. All spell \ncasting or summoning must be completed \nbefore any effects occur. As any summoned \nearth elemental will perform most of its \nwork underground, it is unlikely that it will \nbe intercepted or interrupted. Should this \noccur, however, the movement of the earth \nrequiring its services must be stopped until \nthe elemental is once again available. \nShould the elemental be slain or dismisd, \nthe move earth spell is limited to collapsing \nbanks or walls of earth."
