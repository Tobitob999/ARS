Greater abilities \nrequire that specific commands be uttered, \nperhaps in long-forgotten languages. \nMagical Armor: Enchanted armors are \nthe complements to magical weapons. \nThese armors have a + 1 or better bonus to \ntheir normal Armor Class, being made of \nstuff stronger and finer than nonmagical \narmor. Furthermore, these armors grant \nsome measure of protection against attacks \nthat normal armors would not stop. Chain \nmail +I, for instance, improves the charac- \nter's saving throw against the fiery breath of \na dragon by 1, thus providing more than \njust a physical shield. In rare instances, \narmor may possess extraordinary powers. \nAlthough such armors are generally finely \nmade and elaborately engraved, characters \ncan discover the armors' powers only by the \nsame methods they 'use to discover the \npowers of magical weapons. \nPotions and Oils: Magical potions and \noils are easily found but hard to identify. \nThey come in small bottles, jugs, pots, or \nvials and clearly radiate magic if a detection \nspell is used. However, the effect of any \npotion is unknown until some brave soul \ntries a small sample. The results can be quite \nvaried. The imbiber may discover he can \nfloat or fly, resist great heat or cold, heal \ngrievous wounds, or fearlessly face the \ngreatest dangers. He may also find himself \nhopelessly smitten by the first creature he \n0 \nsees or struck dead by a powerful poison. It \nis a risk that must be taken to learn the \nnature of the potion. \nScrolls: Scrolls are a convenience and lux- \nury for spellcasters. By reading the incanta- \ntion written on the pages, the priest or \nwizard can instantly cast that spell. He does \nnot need to memorize it, have the material \ncomponents handy, or do any of the things \nnormal spellcasting requires. Experienced \nand powerful wizards normally spend their \nevenings preparing such scrolls for their \nown adventuring use. \nSome scrolls are usable by all characters, \ngranting special but temporary protections \nfrom various dangers-evil creatures, were- \nwolves, powerful beings from other planes, \netc. Other scrolls bear hideous or humorous \ncurses, brought into effect at the mere read- \ning of their titles. Unfortunately, the only \nway to know what a scroll contains is to \nsilently scan its contents. For scrolls con- \ntaining wizard spells, this requires the use of \na read magic spell. Other scrolls can be read \nby all. This scan does not cast the spell writ- \nten on the scroll, but it tells the character \nwhat is written there (and exposes him to \nthe effects of curses). Once the scroll is read, \nit can be used at any time in the future by \nthat character. \nRings: Magical rings are usable by many \ndifferent classes and bestow a wide range of \npowers, from pyrotechnic displays to wish- \nes. While the aura of a magical ring can be \ndetected, its properties cannot be discov- \nered until it is worn and the command word \nis uttered. (The command word is most \ncommonly found inscribed on the inside of \nthe band.) As with all magical items, some \nrings can harm your character. Worse still, \ncursed rings can be removed only with the \naid of spells! \nWands, Staves, and Rods: These are \namong the most powerful of standard magi- \ncal items. Wands are commonly used by \nwizards, allowing them to cast powerful \nspells with the flick of a wrist. Staves can be \nused by either a wizard or a priest. Staves \ncan be truly destructive, dwarfing even the \npotential of a wand. Rods are the rarest of \nall, the accouterments of witch-kings and \ngreat lords. With rods come dominance and \npower. \nFortunately for your character, few of \nthese items are cursed or dangerous to han- \ndle. But all must be operated by a command \nword-a specific word or phrase that trig- \ngers the power within. No wand, stave, or \nrod shows any indication of its powers by \nmere sight or handling. Careful research \nand probing are most often needed to tap \nthe potential stored within. \nWands, staves, and rods are not limitless \nin their power. Each use drains them slight- \nly, using up a charge. There is no power \ngauge or meti ng what is left. A char- \n1 08"
