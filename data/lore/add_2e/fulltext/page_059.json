    "text": "Proficiencies (Nonweapon Proficiency Descriptions) I \ncover invisible creatures; he has only a gen- \neral idea of their location and cannot target \nthem exactly. \nBowyedFletcher: This character can \nmake bows and arrows of the types given in \nTable 44, page 68. \nA weaponsmith is required to fashion \narrowheads, but the bowyer/fletcher can \nperform all other necessary functions. The \nconstruction time for a long or short bow is \none week, while composite bows require \ntwo weeks, and ld6 arrows can be made in \none day. \nWhen the construction time for the weap- \non is completed, the player makes a profi- \nciency check. If the check is successful, the \nweapon is of fine quality and will last for \nmany years of normal use without break- \ning. If the check fails, the weapon is still usa- \nble, but has a limited life span: An arrow \nbreaks on the first shot; a bow breaks if the \ncharacter using it rolls an unmodified 1 on \nhis Id20 attack roll. \nOption: If a character wishes to create a \nweapon of truly fine quality and the DM \nallows it, the player can opt to use the fol- \nlowing alternative procedure for determin- \ning the success of his attempt. When the \nproficiency check is made, any failure \nmeans that the weapon is useless. However, \na successful check means that the weapon \nenables the character to add Strength \nbonuses to attack and damage rolls. Addi- \ntionally, if the proficiency check is a natural \n1, the range of the bow is increased 10 yards \nfor all range classes or is of such fine work \nthat it is suitable for enchantment. \nBrewing: The character is trained in the \nart of brewing beers and other strong drink. \nThe character can prepare brewing formu- \nlas, select quality ingredients, set up and \nmanage a brewery, control fermentation, \nand age the finished product. \nCarpentry: The carpentry proficiency \nenables the character to do woodworking \njobs: buildmg houses, cabinetry, joinery, \netc. Tools and materials must be available. \nThe character can build basic items from \nexperience, without the need for plans. \nUnusual and more complicated items (a cat- \napult, for example) require plans prepared \nby an engineer. Truly unusual or highly \ncomplex items (wooden clockwork mecha- \nnisms, for example) require a proficiency \ncheck. \nCharioteering: A character with profi- \nciency in this skill is able to safely guide a \nchariot, over any type of terrain that can \nnormally be negotiated, at a rate V3 faster \nthan the normal movement rate for a char- \niot driven by a character without this profi- \nciency. Note that this proficiency does not \nimpart the ability to move a chariot over \nterrain that it cannot traverse: even the best \ncharioteer in the world cannot take such a \nvehicle into the mountains. \nCobbling: The character can fashion and \nrepair shoes, boots, and sandals. \nCooking: Although all characters have \nrudimentary cooking skills, the character \nwith this proficiency is an accomplished \ncook. A proficiency check is required only \nwhen attempting to prepare a truly magnifi- \ncent meal worthy of a master chef. \nDancing: The character knows many \nstyles and varieties of dance, from folk \ndances to formal court balls. \nDirection Sense. A character with this \nproficiency has an innate sense of direction. \nBy concentrating for ld6 rounds, the char- \nacter can try to determine the direction the \nparty is headed. If the check fails but is less \nthan 20, the character errs by 90 degrees. If a \n20 is rolled, the direction chosen is exactly \nopposite the true heading. (The DM rolls \nthe check.) \nFurthermore, when traveling in the wil- \nderness, a character with direction sense has \nthe chance of becoming lost reduced by 5 % . \nDisguise: The character with this skill is \ntrained in the art of disguise. He can make \nhimself look like any general type of person \nof about the same height, age, weight, and \nrace. A successful proficiency check indi- \ncates that the disguise is successful, while a \nfailed roll means the attempt was too obvi- \nous in some way. \nThe character can also disguise himself as \na member of another race or sex. In this \ncase, a -7 penalty is applied to the profi- \nciency check. The character may also \nattempt to disguise himself as a specific per- \nson, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency \ncheck. These modifiers are cumulative, thus \nit is extremely difficult for a character to dis- \nguise himself as a specific person of another \nrace or sex (a - 17 penalty to the check). \nEndurance: A character with endurance \nproficiency is able to perform continual \nstrenuous physical activity for twice as long \nas a normal character before becoming sub- \nject to the effects of fatigue and exhaustion. \nIn those cases where extreme endurance is \nrequired, a successful proficiency check \nmust be made. Note that this proficiency \ndoes not enable a character to extend the \nlength of time that he can remain unaffected \nby a lack of food or water. \nEngineering: The character is trained as a \nbuilder of both great and small things. Engi- \nneers can prepare plans for everything from \nsimple machines (catapults, river locks, \n58 \ngrist mills) to large buildings (fortresses, \ndams). A proficiency check is required only \nwhen designing something particularly \ncomplicated or unusual. An engineer must \nstill find talented workmen to carry out his \nplan, but he is trained to supervise and man- \nage their work. \nAn engineer is also familiar with the prin- \nciples of siegecraft and can detect flaws in \nthe defenses of a castle or similar construc- \ntion. He knows how to construct and use \nsiege weapons and machines, such as cata- \npults, rams, and screws. \nEtiquette: This proficiency gives the char- \nacter a basic understanding of the proper \nforms of behavior and address required in \nmany different situations, especially those \ninvolving nobility and persons of rank. \nThus, the character will know the correct \ntitle to use when addressing a duke, the \nproper steps of ceremony to greet visiting \ndiplomats, gestures to avoid in the presence \nof dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual \noccurrences, a proficiency check must be \nmade for the character to know the proper \netiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, \nfor example, is a sufficiently rare event). \nHowever, having the character know \nwhat is correct and actually do what is cor- \nrect are two different matters. The encoun- \nters must still be role-played by the \ncharacter. Knowledge of etiquette does not \ngive the character protection from a gaffe or \nfaux pas; many people who know the cor- \nrect thing still manage to do the exact oppo- \nsite. \nFire-building: A character with fire- \nbuilding proficiency does not normally need \na tinderbox to start a fire. Given some dry \nwood and small pieces of tinder, he can start \na fire in 2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not \nrequired. Wet wood, high winds, or other \nadverse conditions increase the time to \n3d20, and a successful proficiency check \nmust be rolled to start a fire. \nFishing: The character is skilled in the art \nof fishing, be it with hook and line, net, or \nspear. Each hour the character spends fish- \ning, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is \nfailed, no fish are caught that hour. Other- \nwise, a hook and line or a spear will land \nfish equal to the difference between the die \nroll and the character's Wisdom score. A net \nwill catch three times this amount. \nOf course, no fish can be caught where no \nfish are found. On the other hand, some \nareas teem with fish, such as a river or pool \nduring spawning season. The DM may \nmodify the results according to the situa- \ntion. \nForgery: This proficiency enables the \ncharacter to create duplicates of documents \nand handwriting and to detect such forger- \nies created by others. To forge a document \n(military orders, local decrees, etc.) where \nthe handwriting is not specific to a person, \nthe character needs only to have Seen a simi-"
