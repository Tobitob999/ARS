    "text": "\"ROF is the rate of fire-how many shots \nthat weapon can fire off in one round. This \nis independent of the number of melee \nattacks a character can make in a round. \nRange is given in tens of yards. Each \nrange category (Short, Medium, or Long) \nincludes attacks from distances equal to or \nless than the given range. Thus a heavy \ncrossbow fired at a target 136 yards away \nuses the medium-range modifier. \nThe modifiers for range are - 2 for medi- \num range and - 5 for long range. \nArquebuses (if allowed) double all range \nmodifiers. \nEquipment Descriptions \nNot every piece of \nequipment is described here. The vast \nmajority of things found on the equipment \nlists need no description, as their functions, \nforms, and purposes are obvious. Only \nthose items whose use is obscure or appear- \nance is unusual are described below. Spe- \ncific game effects of equipment are given in \nTack ilnd Humss \nBarding: A war \nhorse, or any animal trained for combat, is \na considerable investment for the average \nwarrior. Therefore it behooves the owner to \nsee that his mount is as well-protected as \npossible. Other than avoiding risks, the best \nnonmagical protection is horse armor or \nbardmg. Barding is simply some type of \narmor fitted to be worn by the mount. Full \nbarding covers the neck, chest, and body of \nthe beast, while half barding covers the \nhead, neck, chest, and front quarters. Bard- \ning can be made from many different mate- \nrials; stouter types provide increasing \nprotection according to the Armor Class of \nthe construction. All of this, however, is at \nthe expense of increased weight and lowered \nmaneuverability of the mount. Plate bard- \ning, for example, is the equivalent of a war- \nrior's field plate and is made of carefully \ninterlocked plates md joints. It provides an \nArmor Class of 2 to the mount. It weighs at \nleast 80 to 100 pounds at the lightest and \nthus a fully equipped war horse with this \narmor can manage littIe more than a steady \ntrot at top speed. \nBarded animals also require special atten- \ntion. Care must be taken to prevent chafing \nand sores. The mount cannot wear the \narmor indefi@ely, It must be removed at \nnight and iddy should not be worn except \nin preparation for a battle or tournament. \nRemoving horse barding takes 15 minutes \nfor leather and 30 minutes for metal armors. \nFitting it on takes twice as long. The weight \nof barding is carefully distributed to \naccount for the weight of the armor and the \nrider, so barded animals cannot be used as \npack animals! It is normal practice to have a \nsecond mount for carrying gear and sup- \nplies. \nWhen barding is fitted over a mount \nwhose natural Armor Class is better than \nthe barding, some protection is still gained. \nThis is explained under Armor on page 76. \nIn addition to horses and elephants, it \nmay be possible to fit barding on more \nfantastic mounts. Flying steeds can wear \nonly leather or magical barding. Aquatic \ncreatures cannot wear normal barding \nalthough extremely rare magical pieces may \nexist. Other land creatures can certainly be \nbarded, provided your DM rules that they \nare sturdy enough to carry the weight of \narmor and rider. Camels, for instance, are \nseldom barded for this reason. A huge \nostrich would not be able to carry barding, \nsince its legs would not support the weight. \nSaddles: There two basic saddles-riding \nand pack. Riding saddles take many forms, \nbut their basic purpose is to carry a person. \nIf your DM has set his campaign in an \nancient or early Medieval setting, saddles \nmay be without stirrups. Ask your DM to \nbe sure. Pack saddles are special frames \ndesigned to carry supplies and equipment. \nThe only practical limit to how much a well- \nstowed pack saddle can carry is the carrying \nability of the animal. \nTransport \nCaravek This ship \nwas sailed in late MedievaUearly Renais- \nsance times and was the type of ship Colum- \nbus used to reach the New World. (It should \nbe used only in late Medieval settings.) It \nnormally has two or three masts and square \nsails. No oars are used. The typical caravel \nis 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The normal \ncrew is from 30 to 40 men. The average car- \ngo displacement is 150-200 tons. \nCoaster: Also called a round ship, this is a \nsmall merchant ship that hugs the coasts. \nThis is a sailing ship, fitted with two masts \nand triangular sails. The average size is 60 to \n70 feet long and 20 feet wide. The rudder \nhangs from one side. The crew is 20 to 30 \nmen, and the cargo capacity is about 100 \ntons. Normally there is only a small stern- \ncastle. A coaster is slow and not tremen- \ndously seaworthy, but it can carry large \namounts of cargo with smaller crews than \ngalleys. \nCog: This ship is a larger, improved ver- \nsion of the coaster, able to make ventures \ninto the open sea. Like the coaster, it is a \nsailing ship with one or two masts, but the \ncog employs square sails. It is abaut 75 to 90 \nfeet long and 20 feet wide. The crew is only \n18 to 20 men, There is normally one deck \nand fore- and sterncastles. The cargo capac- \nities of cogs vary greatly, but the average is \n100 to 200 tons. \nCurrach: This ship is an early, primitive \nvessel. It is made from thick hides stretched \nover a wood-and-wicker frame. A single \nmast carries a small square sail, but the cur- \nragh is usually worked by oars. It is nod \nly 20 to 40 feet long. The crew is approx- \nimately six to eight and the cargo space is \nlimited-no more than five tons. \nDrakkar: The largest of the Viking long- \nships is known as a drakkar or dragonship. \nBuilt for war, this ship stretches about 100 \nfeet in length. Although a single mast can be \nraised, oars provide the main source of \npower. The crew of 60 to 80 men rows, one \nman to an oar. Up to 160 additional men can \nbe carried for boarding and raiding. Due to \nits great size, a drakkar is not very seawor- \nthy. This and the fact that there is no space \non board for many supplies (certainly not \nenough for 240 men) or sleeping quartem \nkeep the drakkar close to the coast where it \ncan put in for the night. Because of its cost \nand limited use, a drakkar is usudly built by \nkings and rulers and is not used for the mun- \ndane task of shipping cargo. \nDromond: This ship is the largest of the \nByzantine galleys. Although it boasts one or \ntwo masts and triangular saib, the main \npower comes from the 100 oars, %to a side. \nThese oars are divided into an upper and \nlower bank, with one man per oar QH the \nlower bank and three men on the upper \nbank. Thus, the total crew is about 200 \nmen. The dromond is about 130 to 175 feet \nlong and 15 feet wide, making it a very den- \nder ship. The cargo capacity is \n100 tons. \nA dromond can be used bth \nand war. As a warship, a ram projects fmm \nthe front just above the water line. Ca&s \nare buiIt fore, aft, and amidships as fir& \nplatforms. The cargo space is then taLLe0 up \nby marines. With such numbers of men, it is \na very dangerous ship to attack. A drd \nis not a seaworthy craft, howevsr, and W- \nally sails in sight of shore. Tkty beach at \nnight like all galleys, since supplies d \ndeeping accommodations are very limited. \nGPlleon: This is the largest and most \nadvanced sailing ship that rnight~k~ah- \nble in the ADLW game. It should appear \nonly in Renaissanceperiod settings. It is a \nsaildriven ship with three or four ma. \nThere are normally three through decks \nhming the length of the ship), while the \ncastles fore and aft have two decks. The \naverage size is about 130 feet long and 30 \nfeet wide. Crews average about 130 mcn. \nAlthough cargo cslpdty is about 9wo tons, \na galkon is mainly used as a warship. (In the \nreal world they were fitted with cannon, \nsomething beyond the stvldard AD&V \ngame rules.) They can easily carry men \nequal to their tonnage, making capture by \npirates nearly impossible. \nGreat Galley Built du- the Lete Mid- \ndle Ages, the great &ley is an improved \nversion of the dromond. It is slightly sd- \n71"
