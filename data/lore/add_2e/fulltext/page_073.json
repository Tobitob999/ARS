The main power comes from \n140 rowers, one man to an oar but is supple- \nmented by three masts; this combination \ngives it better speed and handling. The car- \ngo capacity is 150 tons. When outfitted as a \nwarship, the front end is built as a ram and \nmarines are carried instead of cargo. Like all \ngalleys, the great galley is a coastal vessel, \nrarely venturing into open water. It is not \nseaworthy in heavy storms and waits in \nport for these to pass. \nKnaa This small ship was a common car- \ngo ship of the Scandinavian region. It is 50 \nto 75 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide. It has a \nsingle mast and a square sail. In times of \npoor wind, a few oars at the bow and stem \ncan provide more power. The crew ranges \nfrom eight to 14 men. The cargo capacity is \nsmall, anywhere from ten to 50 tons. The \nship is, however, relatively seaworthy and \ncan be used to make long sea voyages \n(although it cannot be called comfortable). \nIts flat bottom makes it useful for sailing up \nrivers and estuaries, and it can be beached \neasily. \nLongship: This is the standard Viking \nwarship. It is more substantial than the \nknarr but not nearly as massive as the \ndrakkar. An average longship is 75 feet long \nwith 20 to 25 oars per side. Each oar is \nworked by a single man for a total crew of \n40 to 50 men. There is also a single mast and \na square sail. In addition to the crew, the \nship can carry an additional 120 to 150 men. \nA longship can be used for shipping, but its \ncargo capacity is only about 50 tons. It is, \nhowever, fairly seaworthy and can sail \nacross the open sea when necessary. \nMiscellaneous Equipment \nHoly Item: Holy \nitems are small representations of all those \nthings revered by religions-stars, crosses, \nhammers, rosaries, anointed oils, blessed \nwine, sacred teachings, and more. Just what \nconstitutes a holy item depends on the cam- \npaign your character is in. All good holy \nitems have similar effects on undead and \nother evil creatures, provided they are \nwielded by a follower of a belief associated \nwith these items. Thus, rules that refer to \nholy symbols and holy water apply to all \nsimilar items, provided these items are spe- \ncially prepared by the cleric’s order. \nBecause of their special nature, holy items \ncannot normally be purchased. Different \nsects tend to protect the symbols of their \nfaith to prevent their misuse or corruption. \nTherefore such items must be obtained \nthrough the auspices of a local congrega- \ntion. This is not difficult for sincere fol- \nlowers of that faith, although requests for \nrare or unusual items must always be justi- \nfied. Nonbelievers are given holy items only \nif there is a clear and present danger to the \nfaith. \nLanterns: A hooded lantern (3Gfoot radi- \nus of light) is a standard lantern with shut- \ntered or hinged sides. It is not directional, as \nits light is cast equally in all directions. A \nbullseye lantern (&foot radius of light) has \nonly a single shutter, the other sides being \nhighly polished to reflect the light in a single \ndirection. Both hooded and bullseye lan- \nterns can be carried in one hand. A single \nflask of oil (one pint) bums for six hours in \neither. \nThe beacon lantern (24Gfoot radius of \nlight) is a much larger affair and must be \nmounted on the prow of a ship, the bed of a \nwagon, or other large structure. It operates \nlike the bullseye lantern but illuminates to a \ngreater distance. The beacon goes through \noil quickly, burning a flask every two hours. \nLocks: Locks are still fairly primitive \naffairs (except for those complicated by the \nuse of magic). All are worked with a large \nbulky key. Combination locks are virtually \nunknown at this time. As with most things, \nthere are good, very complex locks as well \nas bad, easily opened locks. \nMagnifying Glass: This simple lens is \nmore an oddity than a useful tool. It does \nnot greatly enhance viewing, especially \nsince many are unevenly ground, creating \ndistortion. It is useful as a substitute for tin- \nder and steel when starting fires. \n72"
