The \nitems in parentheses after each skill describe \nsome of the things the character knows. \nOther knowledge may be added with the \nDMs approval. Thus, a hunter might know \nthe basics of finding food in the wilderness, \nhow to read animal signs to identify the \ntypes of creatures in the area, the habits of \ndangerous animals, and how to stalk wild \nanimals. \nLike the previous method (\"Using What \nYou Know\"), this method has strengths and \nweaknesses. Secondary skills do not pro- \nvide any rules for determining whether a \ncharacter succeeds when he uses a skill to do \nsomething difficult. It is safe to assume that \nsimple jobs succeed automatically. (A \nhunter could find food for himself without \nany difficulty.) For more complicated tasks, \nthe DM must assign a chance for success. He \ncan assign a percentage chance, have the \ncharacter make a saving throw, or require \nan Ability check (see Glossary). The DM \nstill has a lot of flexibility. \nThis flexibility means the DM must some- \ntimes make up the rule to cover the situa- \ntion, however. As mentioned earlier, some \nDMs enjoy this; others do not, their \nstrengths being elsewhere. While secondary \nskills define and limit the player's options, \nthey do not greatly simplify the DMs job. \nNonweapon Proflclencles \nThe most detailed \nmethod for handling character skills is that \nof nonweapon proficiencies. These are \nmuch lie weapon proficiencies. Each char- \nacter starts with a specific number of non- \nweapon proficiency slots and then earns \nadditional slots as he advances. Initial slots \nmust be assigned immediately; they cannot \nbe saved or held in reserve. \nNonweapon proficiencies are the most \ndetailed way to handle the question of what \nthe player character knows. They allow the \nplayer to choose from a broad selection and \ndefine the effects of each choice. Like the \nother methods, however, this system is not \nwithout drawbacks. First, nonweapon pro- \nficiencies are rigid. Being so defined, they \nlimit the options of both the player and DM. \nAt the same time, there will still be ques- \ntions unanswered by these proficiencies. \nWhereas before such questions were broad, \nthey will now tend to be more precise and \ndetailed. Secondly, using this system \nincreases the amount of time needed to cre- \nate a character. While the end result is a \nmore complete, well-rounded person, dt- \nup time can take up to two or three hours. \nNovice players especially may be over- \nwhelmed by the number of choices and \nrules. \nUnlike weapon proficiencies, in which \nsome weapons are not available to certain \ncharacter classes, all nonweapon proficien- \ncies are available to all characters. Some \nnonweapon proficiencies are easier for cer- \ntain character classes to learn, however. \nTable 37 lists all nonweapon proficien- \ncies. They are divided into categories that \n' correspond to character groups. The profi- \nciencies listed under each group can be \nlearned easily by characters of that group. \nA fifth category-\"General\"-contains \nproficiencies that can be learned easily by \nany character. \nRefer to Table 38. When a player selects a \nnonweapon proficiency from those catego- \nries listed under \"Proficiency Croups\" for \nhis character's group, it requires the number \nof proficiency slots listed in Table 37. When \na player selects a proficiency from any other \ncategory, it requires one additional profi- \nciency slot beyond the number listed. \nTable 37: NOWEAPON PROFICIENCY GROUPS \nGENERAL \n# of Slots \nProficiency Required \nAgriculture 1 \nAnimal Handling 1 \nChedC Relevant \nAbility Modifier \nIntelligence 0 \nWisdom -1 \nCarpentry \nCobbling \n1 Strength \n1 Dexterity \n0 \n0 \nFishing 1 Wisdom -1 \nHeraldrv 1 Intdlim-nrr n \nRidinn.
