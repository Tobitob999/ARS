All benefits are \ncumulative, thus a character with a 20 Intel- \nligence is not fooled by 1st- or 2nd-level illu- \nsion spells. \nWisdom \nWisdom (Wis) de- \nscribes a composite of the character's en- \nlightenment, judgment, guile, willpower, \ncommon sense, and intuition. It can affect \nthe character's resistance to magical attack. \nIt is theprime requisite of priests; those with \na Wisdom score of 16 or higher gain a 10 \npercent bonus to experience points earned. \nClerics, druids, and other priests with Wis- \ndom scores of 13 or higher also gain bonus \nspells over and above the number they are \nnormally allowed to use. \nMagical Defense Adjustment listed on \nTable 5 applies to saving throws against \nmagical spells that attack the mind: beguil- \ning, cham, fear, hypnosis, illusions, posses- \nsion, suggestion, etc. These bonuses and \npenalties are applied automatically, without \nany conscious effort from the character. \nBonus Spells indicates the number of ad- \nditional spells a priest (and only a priest) is \nentitled to because of his extreme Wisdom. \nNote that these spells are available only \nwhen the priest is entitled to spells of the ap- \npropriate level. Bonus spells are cumula- \ntive, so a priest with a Wisdom of 15 is \nentitled to two 1st-level bonus spells and \none 2nd-level bonus spell. \nChance of Spell Failure states the percent- \nage chance that any particular spell fails \nwhen cast. Priests with low Wisdom scores \nrun the risk of having their spells fizzle. Roll \npercentile dice every time the priest casts a \nspell; if the number rolled is less than or \nequal to the listed chance for spell failure, \nthe spell is expended with absolutely no ef- \nfect whatsoever. Note that priests with Wis- \ndom scores of 13 or higher don't need to \nworry about their spells failing. \nSpell Immunity gives those extremely wise \ncharacters complete protection from certain \nspells, spell-like abilities, and magical items as \nlisted. These immunities are cumulative, so \nthat a character with a Wisdom of 23 is im- \nmune to all listed spells up to and including \nthose listed on the 23 Wisdom row. \nTablek tVISJIOM \nAbility Defense Bonus of Spell Spell \nMagical Chance \n2 -4 - 60% - \n3 -3 - 50% - \n35% - 6 -1 - \n10 0 0 15% - \n11 0 0 10% - \n14 0 1st 0% - \n15 +1 2nd 0% - \nI \n1 \n\", , \nrd, 5th 0% Fea; \nth, 5th 0% Charm monster, Confusion, Emotion, Fumble, C \nth, 5th 0% Chaos, Feeblemind, Hold monster, Magic jar, \nth, 6th 0% Geas, Mass suggestion, Rod of rulership \nth, 7th 0% Antipathy/syrnpathy, Death spell, Mass charm \ngestion \n- \nCharisma \nThe Charisma (Cha) \nscore measures a character's persuasiveness, \npersonal magnetism, and ability to lead. It is \nnot a reflection of physical attractiveness, al- \nthough attractiveness certainly plays a role. \nIt is important to all characters, but espe- \ncially to those who must deal with non- \nplayer characters (NPCs), mercenary \nhirelings, retainers, and intelligent monsters. \nIt dictates the total number of henchmen a \ncharacter can retain and affects the loyalty of \nhenchmen, hirelings, and retainers. \nMaximum Number of Henchmen states \nthe number of non-player characters who \nwill serve as permanent retainers of the \nplayer character. It does not affect the num- \nber of mercenary soldiers, men-at-arms, \nservitors, or other persons in the pay of the \ncharacter. \nLoyalty Base shows the subtraction from \nor addition to the henchmen's and other ser- \nvitors' loyalty scores (in the DMG). This is \ncrucial during battles, when morale be- \ncomes important. \nReaction Adjustment indicates the pen- \nalty or bonus due to the character bcause \nof Charisma when dealing with non-player \ncharacters and intelligent creatures. For ex- \nample, Rath encounters a centaur, an intelli- \ngent creature. Rath's Charisma is only 6, so \nhe is starting off with one strike against him. \nHe probably should try to overcome this \nslight handicap by making generous offers \nof @fts or irkmation."
