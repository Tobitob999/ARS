    "text": "Held creatures cannot move or speak, but \nthey remain aware of events around them \nand can use abilities not requiring motion or \nspeech. Being held does not prevent the \nworsening of the subjects’ condition due to \nwounds, disease, or poison. The priestcast- \ning the hold person spell can end the spell \nwith a single utterance at any time; other- \nwise the duration is two rounds at 1st level, \nfour rounds at 2nd level, six rounds at 3rd \nlevel, etc. \nThe spellcaster needs a small, straight \npiece of iron as the material component of \nthis spell. \nKnow Alignment (Divination) \nReversible \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn \nCasting time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature or object \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA know alignment spell enables the priest \nto exactly read the aura of a creature or an \naligned object (unaligned objects reveal \nnothing). The caster must remain stationary \nand concentrate on the subject for a full \nround. If the creature rolls a successful sav- \ning throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing \nabout that particular creature from the cast- \ning. Certain magical devices negate the \npower of the know alignment spell. \nThe reverse, undetectable alignment, \nconceals the alignment of an object or crea- \nture for 24 hours. \nMessenger (EnchantmenVCharm) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell enables the priest to call upon a \ntiny (size T) creature of at least animal intel- \nligence to act as his messenger. The spell \ndoes not affect giant animals and it does not \nwork on creatures of low (i.e., 5) Intelli- \ngence or higher. If the creature is within \nrange, the priest, using some type of food \ndesirable to the animal as a lure, can call the \nanimal to come. The animal is allowed a \nsaving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is \nfailed, the animal advances toward the \npriest and awaits his bidding. The priest can \ncommunicate with the animal in a crude \nfashion, telling it to go to a certain place, \nbut directions must be simple. The spell- \ncaster can attach some small item or note to \nthe animal. If so instructed, the animal will \nthen wait at that location until the duration \nof the spell expires. (Note that unless the in- \ntended recipient of a message is expecting a \nmessenger in the form of a small animal or \nbird, the carrier may be ignored.) When the \nspell’s duration expires, the animal or bird \nreturns to its normal activities. The in- \ntended recipient of a message gains no com- \nmunication ability. \nObscurement (Alteration) \nSphere: Weather \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 4 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes a misty vapor to arise \naround the caster. It persists in this locale \nfor four rounds per caster level and reduces \nthe visibility ranges of all types of vision (in- \ncluding infravision) to 2d4 feet. The ground \narea affected by the spell is a square progres- \nsion based on the caster‘s level: a 10’ x 10’ \narea at 1st level, a 20’ x 20 ’ area at 2nd \nlevel, a 30’ x 30‘ area at 3rd level, and so on. \nThe height of the vapor is restricted to 10 \nfeet, although the cloud will otherwise ex- \npand to fill confined spaces. A strong wind \n(such as the 3rd-level wizard spelI, gust of \nwind, can cut the duration of an obscure- \nment spell by 75%. This spell does not func- \ntion under water. \nProduce Flame (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nA bright flame, equal in brightness to a \ntorch, springs forth from the caster’s palm \nwhen he casts a produce flame spell. The \nflame does not harm the caster, but it is hot \nand it causes the combustion of flammable \nmaterials (paper, cloth, dry wood, oil, etc.). \nThe caster is capable of hurling the magical \nflame as a missile, with a range of 40 yards \n(considered short range). The flame flashes \non impact, igniting combustibles within a \nthree-foot diameter of its center of impact, \nand then it goes out. A creature struck by \nthe flame suffers ld4+1 points of damage \nand, if combustion occurs, must spend a \nround extinguishing the fire or suffer addi- \ntional damage assigned by the DM until the \nfire is extinguished. A miss is resolved as a \ngrenade-like missile. If any duration re- \nmains to the spell, another flame immedi- \nately appears in the caster’s hand. The caster \ncan hurl a maximum of one flame per level, \nbut no more than one flame per round. \nThe caster can snuff out magical flame \nany time he desires, but fire caused by the \nflame cannot be so extinguished. This spell \ndoes not function under water. \nResist Flre/Resist Cold (Alteration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is placed upon a creature \nby a priest, the creature‘s body is toughened \nto withstand heat or cold, as chosen by the \ncaster. Complete immunity to mild condi- \ntions (standing naked in the snow or reach- \ning into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) \nis gained. The recipient can somewhat resist \nintense heat or cold (whether natural or \nmagical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, \na large amount of bu’ming oil, flaming \nswords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor \nswarms, red dragon‘s breath, frostbrand \nswords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white \ndragon’s breath. In all of these cases, the \ntemperature affects the creature to some ex- \ntent. The recipient of the spell gains a bonus \nof +3 to saving throws against such attack \nforms and all damage sustained is reduced \nby 50%; therefore, if the saving throw is \nfailed, the creature sustains one-half dam- \nage, and if the saving throw is successful, \nonly one-quarter damage is sustained. Re- \nsistance to fire lasts for one round for each \nexperience level of the priest placing the \nspell. \nThe caster needs a drop of mercury as the \nmaterial component of this spell. \nSilence, 15’ Radius (Alteration) \nSphere: Guardian \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting this spell, complete silence \nprevails in the affected area. All sound is \nstopped: conversation is impossible, spells \ncannot be cast (or at least not those with \nverbal components, if the optional compo- \nnent rule is used), and no noise whatsoever \nissues from or enters the area. The spell can \nbe cast into the air or upon an object, but \nthe effect is stationary unless cast on a mo- \nbile object or creature. The spell lasts two \nrounds for each level of experience of the \npriest. The spell can be centered upon a \ncreature, and the effect then radiates from \nthe creature and moves as it moves.
