A caster who learns \nthat a creature is being influenced has a 5 % \nchance per level to determine the exact type \nof influence. Up to 10 different creatures can \nbe checked before the spell wanes. If the \ncreature is under more than one such effect, \nonly the information that the charms exist is \ngained. The type (since there are conflicting \nemanations) is impossible to determine. \nThe reverse of the spell, undetectable \nchum, completely masks all charms on a \nsingle creature for 24 hours. \nDust Devil (ConjuratiodSurnmoning) \nSphere: Elemental (Air) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 2 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables a priest to conjure up a \nweak air elemental-a dust devil of AC 4,2 \nHD, MV 180 feet per round, one attack for \nld4 points of damage, which can be hit by \nnormal weapons. The dust devil appears as \na small whirlwind one foot in diameter at its \nbase, five feet tall, and three to four feet \nacross at the top. It moves as directed by the \npriest, but dissipates if it is ever separated \nfrom the caster by more than 30 yards. Its \nwinds are sufficient to put out torches, small \ncampfires, exposed lanterns, and other \nsmall, open flames of non-magical origin. \nThe dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a \ncreature in gaseous form at bay or push it \naway from the caster (though it cannot \ndamage or disperse such a cloud). If skim- \nming along the ground in an area of loose \ndust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up \nthose particles and disperses them in a 11)- \nfootdiameter cloud centered on itself. The \ncloud obscures normal vision, and creatures \ncaught within are blinded while inside and \nfor one round after they emerge. A spell- \ncaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud \nwhile casting must make a saving throw vs. \nspell to keep his concentration, or the spell \nis ruined. Any creature native to the ele- \nmental plane of Air-even another dust \ndevil-can disperse a dust devil with a sin- \ngle hit. \nEnthrall (EnchantmenKharm) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: %foot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA priest using this spell can enthrall an \naudience that can fully understand his lan- \nguage. Those in the area of effect must save \nvs. spell or give the caster their undivided \nattention, totally ignoring their surround- \nings. Those of a race or religion unfriendly \nto the caster’s have a +4 bonus to the roll. \nAny Wisdom adjustment also applies. Crea- \ntures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or \nwith a Wisdom of 16 or better, are unaffect- \ned. \nTo cast the spell, the caster must speak \nwithout interruption for a full round. \nThereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as \nthe priest speaks, to a maximum of one \nhour. Those enthralled take no action while \nthe priest speaks, and for ld3 rounds there- \nafter while they discuss the matter. Those \nentering the area of effect must also save or \nbecome enthralled. Those not enthralled are \n50% likely every turn to hoot and jeer in \nunison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest \nare allowed a new saving throw. The speech \nends (but the Id3 round delay still applies) if \nthe priest is successfully attacked or per- \nforms any action other than speaking. \nIf the audience is attacked, the spell ends \nand the audience reacts immediately, rolling \na reaction check with respect to the source \nof the interruption, at a penalty of - 10. \nNote: When handling a large number of \nsaving throws for similar creatures, the DM \ncan assume an average to save time: e.g., a \ncrowd of 20 men with a base saving throw \nof 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men \nenthralled and five not. \nFind Zaps (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 3 turns \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: IO-foot path \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a priest casts a find tmps spell, all \ntraps-concealed normally or magieally- \nof magical or mechanical nature become \napparent to him. Note that this spell is direc- \ntional, and the caster must face the desired \ndirection in order to determine if a trap is \nlaid in that particular direction. \nA trap is any device or magical ward that \nmeets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden \nor unexpected result, the spellcaster would \nview the result as undesirable or harmful, \nand the harmful or undesirable result was \nspecifically intended as such by the creator. \nThus traps include alarms, glyphs, and simi- \nlar spells or devices. \nThe caster learns the general nature of the \ntrap (magical or mechanical) but not its \nexact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close \nexamination will, however, enable the cast- \ner to sense what intended actions might trig- \nger it. Note that the caster’s divination is \nlimited to his knowledge of what might be \nunexpected and harmful. The spell cannot \npredict actions of creatures (hence a con- \ncealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), \nnor are natural hazards considered traps (a \ncavern that floods during rain, a wall weak- \nened by age, a naturally poisonous plant). If \nthe DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to \nidentify magical wards (see the glyph af \nwarding spell), this spell shows the form of \nthe glyph or mark. The spell does not detect \ntraps that have been disarmed or are other- \nwise inactive. \nFire Zap (Abjuration, Evocation) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: TOU& \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent until discharged \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Object touched \nSaving Throw: 112 \nAny closeable item (book, box, bottle, \nchest, coffer, coffin, door, drawer, and so \nforth) can be warded by a fire tnzp spell. The \nspell is centered on a point selected by the \nspellcaster. The item so trapped cannot have \na second closure or warding spell placed \nupon it. A knock spell cannot affect a fire \ntrap in any way-as soon as the offendins \nparty opens the item, the trap dischaw. \nAs with most magical traps, a thief has only \nhalf his normal find traps score to detect a \nfire trap. Failure to remove it swcedulIy \ndetonates it immediately. An unsuccessful \ndispel magic spell will not detonate the \nspell. When the trap is discharged, there will \nbe an exprosion of five4oot radius from the \nspell’s center. All creatures within this area \nmust roll saving throws vs. spell. Damage is \nld4 points plus 1 point per level of the cast- \ner; half that total amount for creatures suc- \ncessfully saving. (Underwater, this ward \ninflicts half damage and creates a large \ncloud of steam.) The item trapped is not \nharmed by this explosion. \nThe caster can use the trapped object \nwithout dkdmging it, as can any individ- \nual to whom the spell was specifically"
