He affects these monsters the \nsame as does a cleric two levels lower-e.g., \nat 3rd level he has the turning power of a \n1st-level cleric. See the section on priests for \nmore details on this ability. \nA paladin may call for his war horse upon \nreaching 4th level, or anytime thereafter. \nThis faithful steed need not be a horse; it \nmay be whatever sort of creature is appro- \npriate to the character (as decided by the \nDM). A paladin's war horse is a very special \nanimal, bonded by fate to the warrior. The \npaladin does not really \"call\" the animal, \nnor does the horse instantly appear in front \nof him. Rather, the character must find his \nwar horse in some memorable way, most \nfrequently by a specific quest. \nA paladin can cast priest spells once he \nreaches 9th level. He can cast only spells of \nthe combat, divination, healing, and pro- \ntective spheres. (Spheres are explained in \nthe Priest section.) The acquisition and cast- \ning of these spells abide by the rules given \nfor priests. \nThe spell progression and casting level are \nlisted in Table 17. Unlike a priest, the pala- \ndin does not gain extra spells for a high Wis- \ndom score. The paladin cannot cast spells \nfrom clerical or druidical scrolls nor can he \nuse priest items unless they are allowed to \nthe warrior group. \nTable 17: PALADIN SPELL \nPROGRESSION \nPaladin Casting Priest Spell Level \nLevel Level 1 2 3 4 \n9 1 I--- \n10 2 2--- \n11 3 21- - \n12 4 22-- \n13 5 221- \n14 6 321- \n15 7 3211 \n16 8 3321 \ncastle or keep (funds can be set aside for this \npurpose). All excess must be donated to the \nchurch or another worthy cause. This \nmoney can never be given to another player \ncharacter or NPC controlled by a player. \nA paladin must tithe to whatever charita- \nble, religious institution of lawful good \nalignment he serves. A tithe is 10 percent of \nthe paladin's income, whether coins, jewels, \nmagical items, wages, rewards, or taxes. It \nmust be paid immediately. \nA paladin does not attract a body of fol- \nlowers upon reaching 9th level or building a \ncastle. However, he can still hire soldiers \nand specialists, although these men must be \nlawful good in comportment. \nA paladin may employ only lawful good \nhenchmen (or those who act in such a man- \nner when alignment is unknown). A paladin \nwill cooperate with characters of other \nalignments only as long as they behave \nthemselves. He will try to show them the \nproper way to live through both word and \ndeed. The paladin realizes that most people \nsimply cannot maintain his high standards. \nEven thieves can be tolerated, provided they \nare not evil and are sincerely trying to \nreform. He will not abide the company of \nthose who commit evil or unrighteous acts. \nStealth in the cause of good is acceptable, \nthough only as a last resort. \nRanger \nAbility \nRequirements: Strength 13 \nDexterity 13 \nConstitution 14 \nWisdom 14 \nWisdom \nPrime Requisites: Strength, Dexterity, \nRaces Allowed: Human, Elf, Half-elf \n13 in Strength, 1 \nDexterity, and 14 in Wisdom. The prime \nrequisites of the ranger are Strength, Dex- \nterity, and Wisdom. Rangers are always \ngood, but they can be lawful, neutral, or \nchaotic. It is in the ranger's heart to do good, \nbut not always by the rules. \nA ranger who has Strength, Dexterity, \nand Wisdom scores of 16 or more gains a 10 \npercent bonus to the experience points he \nearns. \nAlthough the ranger can use any weapon \nand wear any armor, several of his special \nabilities are usable only when he is wearing \nstudded leather or lighter armor. \nAlthough he has the basic skills of a war- \nrior, the ranger also has several advantages. \nWhen wearing studded leather or lighter \narmor, a ranger can fight two-handed with \nno penalty to his attack rolls (see page 96). \nObviously, the ranger cannot use a shield \nwhen fighting this way. A ranger can still \nfight with two weapons while wearing \nheavier armor than studded leather, but he \nsuffers the standard attack roll penalties. \nThe ranger is a skilled woodsman. Even if \nthe optional proficiency rules are not used, \nthe ranger has Tracking proficiency. If the \nproficiency rules are used in your campaign, \nthe ranger knows Tracking without expend- \ning any points.

Furthermore, these may not \nexceed one suit of armor, one shield, four \nweapons (arrows and bolts are not count- \ned), and four other magical items. \nA paladin never retains wealth. He may \nkeep only enough treasure to support him- \nself in a modest manner, pay his henchmen, \nmen-at-arms, and servitors a reasonable \nrate, and to construct or maintain a small \n28 \nTable 18: RANGER ABILITIES \nRanger Hidein Move Casting Priest Spell Levels \nLevel Shadows Silentlv Level 1 2 3 \n7 43% 55% - - - - \n8 49 % 62 % 1 1 \n9 56% 70% 2 a - - \n10 63 70 78 70 3 2 1 - \n- - \n~ - \n- 11 70 % 86 % 4 2 2 \n12 94 % 5 2 3 1 \n16 99 % 99 % 9 3 3** 3 \n* Maximum percentile score \n* * Maximum spell ability"
