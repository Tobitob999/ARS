They have few of- \nfensive spells, but these amvery powerful. \ndl priests use eight-sided Hit Dice (d8s). \nOnly priests gain additional. spells for hav- \ning high Wisdom scores. All priests have a \nlimited selection of weapons and armor, but \nthe restrictions vary according to the my- \nthos. \nAll priests use Table 23 to determine their \nadvancement in level as they gajn experi- \nence points. They also all use Table 24 to de- \ntermine how many spells they receive at \neach level of experience. \nAll priest spells are divided into 16 cate- \ngories called spheres of influence. Different \ntypes of priests have access to different \nspheres; no priest can cast spells from every \nsphere of influence. The 16 spheres of influ- \nence are as follows: All, Animal, Astral, \nCharm, Combat, Creation, Divination, Ele- \nmental, Guardian, Healing, Necromantic, \nPlant, Protection, Summoning, Sun, and \nWeather (see page 34). \nIn addition, a priest has either major or \nminor access to a sphere. A priest with ma- \njor access to a sphere can (eventually) cast \nall spells in the sphere. A priest with minor \naccess to a sphere can cast only 1st-, 2nd-, \nand 3rd-level spells from that sphere. \nAll priests gain one eight-sided Hit Die \n(ld8) per level from 1st through 9th. After \n9th level, priests earn 2 hit points per level \nand they no longer gain additional hit point \nbonuses for high Constitution scores. \nTable 23: PRIEST EXPERIENCE LEVELS \nHit \nDice \nLevel Cleric Druid (d8) \n1 0 0 1 \n2 1,500 2,000 2 \n7 55,000 35,000 7 \n8 110,000 60,000 8 \n9 225.000 90,000 9 \n13 1.125.000 750.000 9+8 \n1,575,000 3,000,000 9+12 \n19 2,475,000 1,500,ocw) 9+20 \n20 2,700,000 2,000,000 9+22 \n* See section on hierophant druids, \npage 37. \nTable 24: PRIEST SPELL PROGRESSIOP \nPriest Spell Level \nLevel I 2 3 4 5 6” 7** \n1 I------ \n2 2------ \n3 3 1 ----- \n73321--- \n83332--- \n94432 1I- \n13 6 6 6 4 2 2 - \n146665321 \n15 6 6 6 6 4 2 1 \n209998752 \nf Usable only by priests with 17 or greatr \n*’ Usable .only by priests with 18 a \nWisdom. \ngr&lt*W&m. \nCleric \nAbility Requirement: Wisdom 9 \nPrime Requisite: Wisdom \nRaces Allowed: All \nThe most common type of priest is th \ncleric. The cleric may be an adherent of an \nreligion (though if the DM designs a specifi \nmythos, the cleric’s abilities and spells ma \nberhanged-see following). Clerics are ger \nerdly good, but are not restricted to gooc \nthey ean have any alignment acceptable t \ntheir ami&. A cleric must have a Wisdor \nscore of 9 or more. High Constitution ali \nCharisma are also particularly useful. \nA cleric who has a Wisdom of 16 or mor \ngains a 10 percent bonus to the experienc \npoints he earns. \ncleric class is similar to certain reli- \nus orders of knighthood of the Middle \nthe Teutonic Knights, the Knights \nars, and Hospitalers. These orders \nound in other lands, such as the \nClerics are sturdy soldiers, although their i \nselection of weapons is limited. They can \nwear any type of armor and use any shield. \nStandard clerics, being reluctant to shed \nblood or spread violence, are allowed to use \nonly blunt, bludgeoning weapons. They can \nuse a fair number of magical items including \nclerical scrolls, most potions and rings, \nsome wands and rods, staves, armor, \nshields, and magical versions of any weap- \nons allowed by their order. \nSpells are the main tools of the cleric, \nhowever, helping him to serve, fortify, pro- \ntect, and revitalize those under his care. He \nhas a wide variety of spells to choose from, \nsuitable to many different purposes and \nneeds. (A priest of a specific mythos proba- \nbly has a more restricted range of spells- \nsee page 34.) A cleric has major access to \nevery sphere of influence except the plant, \nanimal, weather, and elemental spheres (he \nhas minor access to the elemental sphere \nand cannot cask spells of the other three \nspheres). \nThe cleric receives his speh as insight di- \nrectly from his deity (the deity does not need \nto make a persol~al appearance to grant the \nspells the cleric prays for),.as a sign of and \nreward for hisfaith, so he must takecare not \nto abuse his power lest it be taken awry as \npunishment. \nThe cleric is also granted power over \nundead-evil creatures that exist in a form \nof non-life, neither dead nor alive. The \ncleric is charged with defeating these mock- \naries of life. His ability to turn undead (see \npage 103) enables him to drive away these \ncreatures or destroy them utterly (though a \ncleric of evil *alignment can bind the ma- \ntures to his will). Some of the more - \nunded creatures are ghosts, zom% && \ntons, ghouls, and mummies. Vi utd \nliches (undead sorcerers) are two of. the \nmost powerful undead. \nAs a cleric advances in level, he gaiRsaddi- \ntional spells, better combat skills, and a \nstronger turning ability. Upon reaching Btfi \nlevel, the cleric automatically attracts a fanati- \ncally loyal group of believers, provided the \ncharacter has established a place of waship of \nsignificant size. The cleric can build this place \nof worship at any time during his tamer, but \nhe does not attract believers until he reaches \n8th level. These followers are normal ww \nriors, 0th-level soldiers, ready to fight $or the \nderic’s cause. The cleric attracts 20 to WM of \nthese followers; they arrive over a period of \nseveral weeks. After the initial followers as- \nsemble, no new followers trickle m to fill the \nranks of those who have fallen in service. The \nDM decides the exact number and types d fol- \nlowers attracted by the cleric. The character \ncan hire other troops as needed, but these are \nnot as loyal as his followers. \n. At 9th level, the cleric may receive official \napproval to establish a religious stronghold, \n, \n1 ~ ."
