    "text": "Although your character has some impres- \nsive abilities and skills, he really isn’t going \nto be effective without the equipment neces- \nsary for adventuring. To get this equipment, \nhe needs money. Not only does he need \nmoney to outfit himself, but your character \nalso has to cover his living expenses. \nAlthough there are many different types \nof coins and currencies in the world, all \nprices and treasures in the AD&P rules are \ngiven in standard coinage. Your DM may \nhave specific names for different coins and \nmay have different rates of exchange, but \nthis is material particular to his campaign. \nHe will tell you if there are differences from \nthe coins listed here. The standard rate of \nexchange for each coin is given in Table 42. \nThe basic coins are the copper piece (cp) \nand the silver piece (sp). These form the \nbackbone of the monetary system and are \nthe coins most frequently found in the \nhands of the common folk. Above these two \ncoh is the much rarer gold piece (gp). This \ncoin is seldom found in common use and \nmainly exists on paper as the standard \nmoney of account. This means it is used to \nmeasure the value of property and goods. \nLand values, ship cargoes, gemstones, and \npenalty bonds (royal court fines) are nor- \nmally calculated in gold pieces, although \npayment of such vast sums normally takes \nother forms. \nIn addition to these coins, there are other \nunusual metals used in scchange. Most of \nthese come from failed lzurmlcies. As such, \nthey are viewed with skepticism by many \nhonest folk. Principal among these coins are \nthe eiectrum (ep) and platinum pieces (pp). \nThese coins are rarely circulated, and most are \nhidden away in ancient treasure hoards. \nThe value of each coin can also be figured \nby the following: 10 cp =, 1 sp; 5 sp = 1 ep; \n2ep = 1gp;5gp = lpp. \nHowever, remember that not all wealth is \nmeasured by coins. Wealth can take many \nforms-land, livestock, the right to collect \ntaxes or customs, and jewelry are all mea- \nsures of wealth. Coins have no guaranteed \nvalue. A gold piece can buy a lot in a small \nvillage but won’t go very far in a large city. \nThis makes other forms of wealth, land for \ninstance, all the more valuable. Indeed, \nmany a piece of jewelry is actually a way of \ncarrying one’s wealth. Silver armbands can \nbe traded for goods, a golden brooch can \nbuy a cow, etc. In your adventures, wealth \nand riches may take many different forms. \nFurthermore, in your DMs campaign, \nthere may be special situations or consider- \nations to bear in mind. The Kingdom of \nGonfli may be at war with the neighboring \nPrincipality of Boosk. Patriotic Gonflians \nmight refuse Boosk coins (probably because \nthey think the coins are worthless). Practi- \ncal Booskites might accept the Gonfli florin \nat half normal value (so they can melt them \ndown and mint new Boosk drachmas). Of \nTable 42: STANDARD EXCHANGE RATES \nCoin CP \nExchange Value \nSP EP GP r \nPlatinum Piece (PP) = 500 10 5 1 \ncourse, both groups would send your char- \nacter to the local money changer (if there is \none), who would cheerfully convert your \nforeign coins to the local tender. He will, of \ncourse, charge a small commission (10- \n30%) for this service. \nSituations such as these can affect the val- \nue of any coin. If your characters start flash- \ning about a lot of gold, pumping it into the \nlocal economy, merchants will quickly raise \nprices. As another example, the local lord \nmay commandeer most of the region’s \nhorses for his knights, making those left all \nthat much more expensive. \nStarting Money \nAll player charac- \nters begin with some amount of cash. This \nnest egg may be your character’s life sav- \nings. It may be a gift from his parents to \nstart him out in the world. It may be his \nbooty from an army campaign. Perhaps he \nstumbled across a small treasure chest, \nwhetting his appetite for greater and more \ndangerous prizes. How he came by his \nmoney is not important (although it may be \nfun to know). You are free to create any \nexplanation you want. \nTo learn your character’s starting funds, \nroll the dice indicated for his group in Table \n43. This is the number of gold pieces your \ncharacter has to obtain equipment. If you \nare creating a character starting out at a \nlevel above 1st level, check with the DM to \nsee if you can increase your Character‘s \nfunds beyond the amounts given here. \nMulti-class characters use the most \nadvantageous die range of their classes. \nTable 43: INITIAL CHARACTER FUNDS \nCharacter Group Be Range \nWamor 5d4 X 1Ogp \nWizard \nRogue 2d6 X lOgp \nPriest 3d6 X 1Ogp \n* Priest characters can use their money \nonly to purchase equipment and goods. \nOnce all purchases are made, the priest \ncharacter must return all but two or three of \nhis remaining gold pieces to his superiors \n(since his equipment is supplied by his orga- \nnization). Priests cannot lend any of their \ninitial funds to other characters. \n(ld4 +1) X 10 gp \nEquipment Lists \nThe following lists \ninclude much of the equipment your charac- \nter needs for adventuring. The most basic of \nthese are weapons, armor, clothing, and \noutfitting gear. The other lists provide \ngoods and services your character may need \nduring the course of his many adventures. \nWhile most items are always available, your \nDM may add to or delete from these lists. \nWhat you want may not be available or, if \nyour DM has set his game in a specific time \nperiod, may not have been discovered or \ninvented yet! While he should tell you \nwhich items are and aren’t available, you \nshould ask if you have any doubts, particu- \nlarly on large purchases. \nMany of the uncommon items in these \nlists are explained in the following pages. \nThe price given for each item in the lists is \nits average price, the amount you can expect \nthe item to cost in a normal economy. How- \never, large cities, barren wildernesses, and \nplaces with brave adventurers carrying bags \nfull of gold are not normal economies. In \nthese places you may find yourself paying \nmore (very rarely less) than the amount list- \ned. You can also haggle with merchants over \nprices, although to speed up the game it’s \nrecommended that you save this for your \nimportant purchases. If you wind up hag- \ngling over the cost of every tankard of ale, \nyour character is going to spend more time \nbeing a pennypincher than an adventurer1 \nTable 44: EQUIPME” \nClothing \nItem \nBelt \nBoots \nRiding \nsoft \nBreech& \nCap, hat \nCloak \nGood cloth \nFine fur \nGirdle \nGloves \nGown, common \nHose \nKnife sheath \nMittens \nPin \nPlain brooch"
