    "text": "Effects of Srnprlse \nCharacters and mon- \nsters that are surprised all suffer the same \npenalty. They are caught off guard and thus \ncannot react quickly. The surprising group \nreceives one round of attacks with melee, \nmissile, or magical items. They cannot use \nthese moments of surprise to cast spells. \nA ranger on the unsurprised side could \nfire his long bow twice (two attacks per \nround) before his opponents could wen \nhope to react. A fighter able to attack twice \nper round could attempt both hits before \nany initiative dice are rolled. A mage could \nunleash a bolt from his wand of lightning \nbefore the enemy knew he was there. Of \ncourse, what applies to player characters \nalso applii to monsters, so that the leopard \nin the earlier example could claw and bite \nbefore the characters wen knew what was \nha-. \nme second effect of surprise is that the \nsurprised characters lose all AC bonuses for \nhigh,Dexterity during that instant of sur- \nprise. The surprised characters are dumb- \nfounded by the attack. Instead of ducking \nand countering, they're just standing there \nrather flat-footed (maybe wen with dumb \nexpressions on their faces). Since they don't \ngrasp the situation, they cannot avoid the \nhazards and dangers very well. \nSurprise can also be used to avoid an \nencounter. Unsurprised characters can \nattempt to flee from a surprised group \nbefore the other group reacts. Of course, \nthis is not always successful, since escape is \ngreatly dependent upon the movement rates \nof the different creatures. \nIf both groups manage to surpiise each \nother, the effects of surprise are cancelled. \nFor example, Rath runs around the comer \nstra*t into some lounging guardsmen. \nTaken by surprise, he stops suddenly and \nfrantically looks for someplace else to run. \nThe guardsmen in turn look up rather stu- \npidly, trying to figure out why this dwarf \njust raced around the comer. The surprise \npasses. Rath spots another alley and the \nguards decide that since he's running, Rath \nmust be a criminal. Initiative rolls are now \nmade to see who acts first. \nEncounter Distance ~ \nOnce your charac- \nter or party has an encounter and it has been \ndetermined whether or not anyone was sur- \nprised, your DM will tell you the range of \nthe encounter-the distance separating you \nfrom the other group. Many factors affect \nencounter distance. These include the open- \nness of the terrain, the weather conditions, \nwhether surprise occurred, and the time of \nday, to name a few. Although you do not \nknow the exact distance until your DM tells \nyou, surprise, darkness- or close terrain \n(woods, city streets, or narrow dungeons) \nusually results in shorter encounter dis- \ntances, while open ground (deserts, p-s, \nor moors), good light, or advance warning \nresults in greater encounter distances (see \nChapter 13). \nEncounter Options \nOnce an encounter \noccurs, there is no set sequence for what \nhappens next. It all depends on just what \nyour characters have encountered and what \nthey choose.to do. That's the excitement of a \nrole-playing game-once you meet some- \nw, almost anything could happen. There \nare some fairly common results of encoun- \nters, however. \nEvasion: Sometimes all you want is for \nyour characters to avoid, escape, or other- \nwise get away from whatever it is you've \nmet. Usually this is because you realize your \ngroup is seriously outmatched. Perhaps \nreturning badly hurt from an adventure, \nyour group spots a red dragon soaring over- \nhead. You know it can turn your party to \ntoast if it wants. Rather than take that risk, \nyour group hides, waiting for it to pass. Or, \ntopping a ridge, you see the army of \nFrazznargth the Impious, a noted warlord. \nThere are 5,000 of them and six of you. \nRetreat seems like the better part of valor, so \nyou turn your horses and ride. \nSometimes you want to avoid an encoun- \nter simply because it will take too much \ntime. While riding with an urgent message \nfor his lord, your character rides into a \ngroup of wandering pilgrims. Paying them \nno mind, he lashes his horse and gallops \npast. \nEvading or avoiding an encounter is not \nalways successful. Some monsters pursue, \nothers do not. In the examples above, \nFrazprargth the Impious (being a prudent \ncommander) orders a mounted patrol to \nchase the characters and bring them in for \nquestioning. The pilgrims, on the other \nhand, shout a few oaths as your galloping \nhorse splashes mud on them and then con- \ntinue on their way. Your character's success \nat evading capture will depend on move- \nment rates, determination of pursuit, ter- \nrain, and just a little luck. Sometimes when \nhe really should be caught, your character \ngets lucky. At other times, well, he just has \nto stand his ground. \nTak Your character doesn't run from \nencounters all the time, and attacking w- \nerything you meet eventually leads to prob- \nlems. Sometimes the best thing to do is talk, \nwhether it's casual conversation, hardball \nnegotiation, jovial rumor-swapping, or \nintimidating threats. In fact, talking is often \nbetter than fighting. To solve the problems \nyour DM has created for your character, \nyou need information. Asking the right \nauestions. developing contacts, and puttinn \n112 \nout the word are all u3eful days to use an \nencounter. Not everything you meet, \nhuman or otherwise, is out to kill yo~lr W \nacter. Help often appears in the most WIT- \ntime to talk to creatures. \nFight: Of course, there are times when \nyou don't want to or can't run away. (Re \nning all the time is not that heroic.) And \nthere are times when you know tdkhg is \nnot a good idea. Sooner OF later, your char- \nacter will have to fight. The real trick is \nknowing when to fight and when to talk or \nrun. If you attack wery creature you nteet, \nthe first thing that will happen is that \nnobody will want to met with your durac- \nter. Your character will also to kill \nor chase o€f everyone who 'might want to \nhelp him. Final15 sooner or later your DM \nis going to get tired of this and send an \nincredibly powerful group of monsters after' \nyour character. Given the fact that you've \nbeen killing werythingin sight, he's just-ified \nin doing this. \nSo it is important always to know who \nyou are attacking and why. As with the best \npolice in the world today< the trick is to €ig- \nure out who are the bad guys and who are \nthe good guys. Make mistakes and you pay. \nYou may kill an Npc who has a vital due, \nor unintentionally anger a baron far more \npowerful than yourself. NPCs wiII be reluc- \ntant to associate with your char-, and \nthe law will find fewer and feww reas~lls to \nprotect him. It is always best to look on \ncombat as a last resort. \nWait: Sometimes when you encounter \nanother group, you doift \nshould do. You don't want \ncase they are friendly, but you dm't want to \nsay anything to provoke them. What you \ncan do is wait and see how they react. Wait- \ning is a perfectly sensible option. However, \nthere is the risk that in waiting, you lose the \nadvantage should the other side suddenly \ndecide to attack. Waiting for a reaction so \nthat you can decide what to do causes a + 1 \npenalty to the first initiative \ngroup, if the other si& attacks. \nprisingforms.Thusitoftmpa~to*the \nof course, in any giv \nmay be many other op \ncharacter. The only \nination (and common sense). charsing a \nband of orcs to break th~ough their lines and \nflee may work. T& them doMl with an \nelaborate bluff about the army coming up \nbehind you might scare them off. clever use \nof spells could end the cncouuter in sudden \nand unexved ways. The point is, this is a \nrole-playing game and the options are as \nvaried as you wish to make them."
