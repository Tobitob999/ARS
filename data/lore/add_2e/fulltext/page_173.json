    "text": "I- - \nrd Snells (5th 1 \nup to 20 feet per round. The spell lasts two \nrounds, plus one round per caster level. The \nweight can be moved vertically, horizon- \ntally, or both. An object moved beyond the \ncaster's range falls or stops. If the caster \nceases concentration for any reason, the ob- \nject falls or stops. The object can be tele- \nkinetically manipulated as if with one hand. \nFor example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a \nkey can be turned, an object rotated and so \non, if the force required is within the weight \nlimitation. The caster might even be able to \nuntie simple knots, at the discretion of the \nDM. \nAlternatively, the spell energy can be ex- \npended in a single round. The caster can \nhurl one or more objects within range, and \nwithin a ten-foot cube, directly away from \nhimself at high speed, to a distance of up to \nten feet per caster level. This is subject to a \nmaximum weight of 25 pounds per caster \nlevel. Damage caused by hurled objects is \ndecided by the DM, but cannot exceed 1 \npoint of damage per caster level. Opponents \nwho fall within the weight capacity of the \nspell can be hurled, but they are allowed a \nsaving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. \nFurthermore, those able to employ as simple \na counter-measure as an enlarge spell, for \nexample (thus making the body weight go \nover the maximum spell limit), can easily \ncounter the spell. The various Bigby's hand \nspells also counter this spell. \nTeleport (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is used, the wizard in- \nstantly transports himself, along with a cer- \ntain amount of additional weight that is on \nor being touched by the spellcaster, to a \nwell-known destination. Distance is not a \nfactor, but interplanar travel is not possible \nby means of a teleport spell. The spellcaster \nis able to teleport a maximum weight of 250 \npounds, plus an additional 150 pounds for \neach level of experience above the 10th (a \n13th-level wizard can teleport up to 700 \npounds). If the destination area is very fa- \nmiliar to the wizard (he has a clear mental \npicture through actual proximity to and \nstudy of the area), it is unlikely that there is \nany error in arriving, although the caster \nhas no control over his facing upon arrival. \nLesser known areas (those seen only magi- \ncally or from a distance) increase the proba- \nbility of error. Unfamiliar areas present \nconsiderable peril (see table). \nProbability of \nTeleporting: \nOn \nDestination Is: High Target Low \nVery familiar 01-02 03-99 00 \nStudied carefully 0144 05-98 99-00 \nSeen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 \nViewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 \nNever seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 \nTeleporting high means the wizard arrives \nten feet above the ground for every 1% he is \nbelow the lowest \"On Target\" probability; \nthis could be as high as 320 feet if the desti- \nnation area was never seen. Any low result \nmeans the instant death of the wizard if the \narea into which he teleports is solid. A wiz- \nard cannot teleport to an area of empty \nspace-a substantial surface must be there, \nwhether a wooden floor, a stone floor, natu- \nral ground, etc. Areas of strong physical or \nmagical energies may make teleportation \nmore hazardous or even impossible. \nTransmute Rock to Mud (Alteration) \nReversible \nRange: 10 yardsllevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: One 20-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell turns natural rock of any sort \ninto an equal volume of mud. The depth of \nthe mud can never exceed one-half its length \nor breadth. If it is cast upon a rock, for ex- \nample, the rock affected collapses into mud. \nCreatures unable to levitate, fly, or other- \nwise free themselves from the mud sink at \nthe rate of ten feet per round and suffocate, \nexcept for light-weight creatures that could \nnormally pass across such ground. Brush \nthrown atop the mud can support creatures \nable to climb on top of it, with the amount \nof brush required subject to the DMs discre- \ntion. The mud remains until a dispel magic \nspell or a reverse of this spell, mud to rock, \nrestores its substance-but not necessarily \nits form. Evaporation turns the mud to nor- \nmal dirt, at the rate of ld6 days per ten cubic \nfeet. The mud to rock reverse can harden \nnormal mud into soft stone (sandstone or \nsimilar mineral) permanently unless magi- \ncally changed. \nThe material components for the spell are \nclay and water (or sand, lime, and water for \nthe reverse). \nWall of Force (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Up to 10-foot square/level \nSaving Throw: None \nA wall of force spell creates an invisible \nbarrier in the locale desired by the caster, up \nto the spell's range. The wall of force cannot \nmove and is totally unaffected by most \nspells, including dispel magic. But a disinte- \ngrate spell will immediately destroy it, as \nwill a rod of cancellation or a sphere of anni- \nhilation. Likewise, the wall of force is not \naffected by blows, missiles, cold, heat, elec- \ntricity, etc. Spells and breath weapons can- \nnot pass through it in either direction, \nalthough dimension door, teleport, and \nsimilar effects can bypass the barrier. \nThe wizard can, if desired, form the wall \ninto a spherical shape with a radius up to \none foot per level or to an open hemispheri- \ncal shape of 1.5-foot radius per caster level. \nThe wall of force must be continuous and \nunbroken when formed; if its surface is bro- \nken by any object or creature, the spell fails. \nThe caster can end the spell on command. \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of powdered diamond worth 5,000 \ngP. \nWall of \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 15 square feet/level or \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard causes \na vertical iron wall to spring into being. This \nwall can be used to seal off a passage or \nclose a breach, for the wall inserts itself into \nany surrounding nonliving material if its \narea is sufficient to do so. The wall of iron is \n1/4 inch thick per level of experience of the \nspellcaster. The wizard is able to create an \narea of iron wall up to 15 square feet for \neach of his experience levels, so at 12th level \na wall of iron 180 square feet in area can be \ncreated. The wizard can double the wall's \narea by halving its thickness. \nIf the caster desires, the wall can be cre- \nated vertically resting on a flat surface, SO \nthat it can be tipped over, to fall on and \ncrush any creature beneath it. The wall is \n50% likely to tip in either direction. This \nchance can be modified by a force of not less \nthan 30 Strength and 400 pounds mass- \neach pound over 400 or Strength point over \n30 alters the chance by 1% in favor of the \nstronger side. Creatures with room to flee \nthe falling wall may do so by making suc- \n172"
