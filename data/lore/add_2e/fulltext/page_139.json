    "text": "1 a‘ Wizard Spells (1 st Level) \nSleep (EnchantmentKharm) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 5 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a wizard casts a sleep spell, he \ncauses a comatose slumber to come upon \none or more creatures (other than undead \nand certain other creatures specifically \nexcluded from the spell’s effects). All crea- \ntures to be affected by thesleep spell must be \nwithin 30 feet of each other. The number of \ncreatures that can be affected is a function of \nHit Dice or levels. The spell affects 2d4 Hit \nDice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit \nDice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more \nare unaffected. The center of the area of \neffect is determined by the spellcaster. The \ncreatures with the least Hit Dice are affected \nfirst, and partial effects are ignored, \nFor example, a wizard casts sleep at three \nkobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll \n(2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and one \ngnoll are affected (1/z + 1/z + 1/z + 2 = 3% \nHit Dice). Note that the remainder is not \nenough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. \nSlapping or wounding awakens affected \ncreatures but normal noise does not. Awak- \nening requires one entire round. Magically \nsleeping opponents can be attacked with \nsubstantial bonuses (see Combat, page 90). \nThe material component for this spell is a \npinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live \ncricket. \nSpider Climb (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA spider climb spell enables the recipient \nto climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as \nwell as a giant spider, or even hang upside \ndown from ceilings. Unwilling victims must \nbe touched and are then allowed a saving \nthrow vs. spell to negate the effect. The \naffected creature must have bare hands and \nfeet in order to climb in this manner, at a \nmovement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). \nDuring the course of the spell, the recipient \ncannot handle objects that weigh less than a \ndagger (one pound), for such objects stick to \nhis hands and feet. Thus a wizard will find it \nvirtually impossible to cast spells if under a \nspider climb spell. Sufficient force can pull \nthe recipient free; the DM can assign a sav- \ning throw based on circumstances, the \nstrength of the force, and so on. For exam- \nple, a creature with a Strength of 12 might \npull the subject free if the subject fails a sav- \ning throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately \ndifficult saving throw). The caster can end \nthe spell effect with a word. \nThe material components of this spell are \na drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of \nwhich must be eaten by the spell recipient. \nSpook (IllusiodPhantasm) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature within 30 feet \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA spook spell enables the wizard to play \nupon natural fears to cause the target crea- \nture to perceive the spellcaster as someone \nor something inimical. Without actually \nknowing what this is, the wizard merely \nadvances threateningly upon the creature. If \na successful saving throw vs. spell is not \nmade, the creature turns and flees at maxi- \nmum speed as far from the wizard as possi- \nble, though items carried are not dropped. \nThe creature has a saving throw penalty of \n-1 for every two experience levels of the \nthe caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th \nlevel. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll \nof 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of \nsaving throw penalties. Although the caster \ndoes not actually pursue the fleeing crea- \nture, a phantasm from its own mind does. \nEach round after the initial casting, the crea- \nture receives another saving throw, without \npenalty, until it successfully saves and the \nspell is broken. In any event, the spell func- \ntions only against creatures with Intelli- \ngences of 2 or more, and undead are not \naffected at all. \nTaunt (Enchantment) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA taunt spell enables the caster to jape \nand jeer effectively at a single type of crea- \nture with an Intelligence of 2 or greater. The \ncaster need not speak the language of the \ncreatures. His words and sounds have real \nmeaning for the subject creature or crea- \ntures: challenging, insulting, and generally \nirritating and angering the listeners. Those \nfailing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to \ndo battle with the spellcaster. All affected \ncreatures attack the spellcaster in melee if \nphysically capable of doing so, seeking to \nuse body or hand-held weapons rather than \nmissile weapons or spells. Separation of the \ncaster from the victim by an impenetrable \nor uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire, a \ndeep chasm, a formation of set pikemen) \n138 \ncauses the spell to break. If the caster taunts \na mixed group, he must choose the type of \ncreature to be affected. Creatures com- \nmanded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Cha- \nrisma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.) \nmight gain a saving throw bonus of +1 to \n+4, at the DMs discretion. If used in con- \njunction with a ventriloquism spell, the \ncreatures may attack the apparent source, \ndepending upon their Intelligence, a leader’s \npresence, and so on. \nThe material component is a slug, which \nis hurled at the creatures to be taunted. \nI \nTenser’s Floating Disc (Evocation) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 turns +~ 1 turdlevel \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nWith this spell, the caster creates the \nslightly concave, circular plane of force \nknown as Tenser’s floating disc (after the \nfamed wizard whose greed and ability to \nlocate treasure are well known). The disc is \nthree feet in diameter and holds 100 pounds \nof weight per level of the wizard casting the \nspell. The disc floats at approximately three \nfeet above the ground at all times and \nremains level. It floats along horizontally \nwithin its range of 20 yards at the command \nof the caster, and will accompany him at a \nmovement rate of no more than 6. If \nunguided, it maintains a constant interval of \nsix feet between itself and the wizard. If the \nspellcaster moves beyond range (by moving \nfaster, or by such means as a teleport spell, \nor by trying to take it more than three feet \nfrom the surface beneath it), or if the spell \nduration expires, the floating disc winks out \nof existence and whatever it was supporting \ncrashes to the surface beneath it. \nThe material component of the spell is a \ndrop of mercury. \nUnseen Servant \n(ConjuratiodSummonining) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour + 1 tum/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: jo-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None \nThe unseen servant is a non-visible, \nmindless, and shapeless force, used to step \nand fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold \nchairs, as well as to clean and mend. It is not \nstrong, but unfailingly obeys the command \nof the wizard. It can carry out only one \nactivity at a time and can move only light- \nweight items-carry a maximum of 20 \npounds or push or pull 40 pounds across a"
