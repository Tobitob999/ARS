    "text": "i \nExample: A 14th-level priest uses the gi- \nant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that \nis available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides \nthe beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 \npoints of damage. \nNote that the spell works only on actual \ninsects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other \ntypes of small creatures are not affected. \nAny giant insects created by this spell do not \nattempt to harm the priest, but the priest's \ncontrol of such creatures is limited to simple \ncommands (\"attack,\" \"defend,\" \"guard,\" and \nso forth). Orders to attack a certain creature \nwhen it appears or guard against a particu- \nlar occurrence are too complex. Unless com- \nmanded to do otherwise, the giant insects \nattempt to attack whoever or whatever is \nnear them. \nThe reverse of the spell, shrink insect, re- \nduces any giant insect to normal insect size. \nThe number of Hit Dice affected by the \npriest is subtracted from the number of Hit \nDice of the insects, and any insect reduced \nto 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial \nshrinking is ignored; an insect is either \nshrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level \npriest attacked by giant ants could shrink \nthree warrior ants or four worker ants to \nnormal insect size with no saving throw. \nThis spell has no effect on intelligent insect- \nlike creatures. \nThe priest must use his holy symbol for \neither version of the spell. \nHallucinatory Forest \n(ntusion/Phantasm) \nReversible \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nhation: Permanent \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 40-foot square/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a hallucinatory \nforest comes into existence. The illusionary \nforest appears to be perfectly natural and is \nindistinguishable from a real forest. Priests \nattuned to the woodlands-as well as such \ncreatures as centaurs, dryads, green drag- \nons, nymphs, satyrs, and treants- \nrecognize the forest for what it is. All other \ncreatures believe it is there, and movement \nand order of march are affected accordingly. \nTouching the illusory growth neither affects \nthe magic nor reveals its nature. The hallu- \ncinatory forest remains until it is magically \ndispelled by a reverse of the spell or a dispel \nmagic spell. The area shape is either roughly \nrectangular or square, in general, and at \nleast 40 feet deep, in whatever location the \ncaster desires. The forest can be of less than \nmaximum areaif the caster wishes. One of \nits edges can appear up to 80 yards away \nfrom the caster. \nHold Plant (EnchantmenKham) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe hold plant spell affects vegetable \nmatter as follows: 1) it causes ambulatory \nvegetation to cease moving; 2) it prevents \nvegetable matter from entwining, grasping, \nclosing, or growing; 3) it prevents vegetable \nmatter from making any sound or move- \nment that is not caused by wind. The spell \neffects apply to all forms of vegetation, in- \ncluding parasitic and fungoid types, and \nthose magically animated or otherwise mag- \nically empowered. It affects such monsters \nas green slime, molds of any sort, shambling \nmounds, shriekers, treants, etc. The dura- \ntion of a hold plant spell is one round per \nlevel of experience of the caster. It affects \nld4 plants in a 40' X 40' area-or a square \nfour to 16 yards on a side of small ground \ngrowth such as grass or mold. If but one \nplant (or four yards square) is chosen as the \ntarget for the spell by the caster, the saving \nthrow of the plant (or area of plant growth) \nis made with a -4 penalty to the die roll; if \ntwo plants (or eight yards square) are the \ntarget, saving throws suffer a -2 penalty; if \nthree plants (or 12 yards square) are the tar- \nget, saving throws suffer a - 1 penalty; and \nif the maximum of four plants (or 16 yards \nsquare) are the target, saving throws are un- \nmodified. \nImbue With Spell Ability \n(Enchantment) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Person touched \nSaving Throw: None \nBy the use of this spell, the priest can \ntransfer a limited number and selection of \nhis currently memorized spells, and the abil- \nity to cast them, to another person. Only \nnon-spellcasters (including rangers under \n8th level and paladins under 9th level) can \nreceive this bestowal; the imbue with spell \nability enchantment does not function for \nthose belonging to spellcasting classes, for \nunintelligent monsters, nor for any individ- \nual with less than 1 full Hit Die. In addition, \nthe person thus imbued must have a Wis- \ndom score of 9 or higher. Only priest spells \nof an informational or defensive nature or a \ncure light wounds spell can be transferred. \nTransferring any other spell type negates the \nentire attempt, including any allowable \nspells that were chosen. Higher level per- \nsons can receive more than one spell at the \npriest's option: \nLevel of Recipient Spells Imkd \n1 One 1st-level spell \n3 Two 1st-level spells \n5+ Two 1st- and one \n2nd-level spells \nThe transferred spell's variable character- \nistics (range, duration, area of effect, etc.) \nfunction according to the level of the priest \noriginally imbuing the spell. \nA priest who casts imbue with spell abil- \nity upon another character loses the number \nof 1st- and 2nd-level spells he has imbued \nuntil the recipient uses the transferred spells \nor is slain. For example, a 7th-level priest \nwith five 1st- and four 2nd-level spells im- \nbues a 10th-level fighter with a cure light \nwounds spell and a slow poison spell. The \ncleric now can have only four 1st-level \nspells memorized until the cure is cast and \nonly three 2nd-level spells until the slow \npoison is cast, or until the fighter iskilled. In \nthe meantime, the priest remains responsi- \nble to his ethos for the use to which the spell \nis put. \nThe material components for this spell are \nthe priest's holy symbol, plus some minor \nitem from the recipient that is symbolic of \nhis profession (a lockpick for a thief, etc.). \nThis item, and any material component for \nthe imbued spell, is consumed when the im- \nbue with spell ability spell is cast. \nLower Water (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Water) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe lower water spell cau- water or \nsimilar fluid in the area of effect to sink \naway to a minimum depth of one inch. The \ndepth can be lowered by up to two feet for \nevery experience level of the priest. The wa- \nter is lowered within a square area whose \nsides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, \nan 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16' \nx 80' x 80', a 9th-level caster affects a vol- \nume up to 18' x 90' X 90', and so on. In \nextremely large and deep bodies of water, \nsuch as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirl- \npool that sweeps ships and similar craft \ndownward, putting them at risk and render- \ning them unable to leave by normal move- \nment for the duration of the spell. When \ncast on water elementals and other water- \nbased creatures, this spell acts as a slow \ni \n218"
