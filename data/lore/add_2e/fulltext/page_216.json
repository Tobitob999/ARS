    "text": "Priest Spells (4th Level) \nm \nClass. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initia- \ntive roll should be made for the insects to see \nif their damage occurs before the spell is \ncast. If it does, the victim's concentration is \nruined and the spell is lost. \nThe insects disperse and the spell ends if \nthe victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. \nBesides being driven off by smoke or hot \nflames, the swarm might possibly be out- \nrun, or evaded by plunging into a suffiaent \nbody of water. If evaded, the summoned \ninsects can be sent against another oppo- \nnent, but there will be at least a 1 round \ndelay while they leave the former opponent \nand attack the new victim. Crawling insects \ncan travel only about 10 feet per round \n(maximum speed over smooth ground) and \nflying insects travel 60 feet per round. The \ncaster must concentrate to maintain the \nswarm; it dissipates if he moves or is dis- \nturbed. \nIt is possible, in underground situations, \nthat the caster might summon ld4 giant ants \nby means of the spell, but the possibility is \nonly 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This \nspell does not function under water. , \nThe materials needed for this spell are the \ncaster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a \nbit of mud or wet clay. \nlcee (Alteration) \nSphw: Plant \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 6 turns + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nassume the form of a small living tree or \nshrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with \nbut a few limbs. Although the closest \ninspection cannot reveal that this plant is \nactually a person, and for all normal tests he \nis, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able \nto observe all that goes on around him just \nas if he were in normal form. The Armor \nClass and hit polnts of the plant are those of \nthe caster. The caster can remove the spell at \nany time, instantly changing from plant to \nhis normal form and having full capability \nfor any action normally possible (including \nspellcasting). Note that all clothing and gear \nworn or carried change with the caster. \nThe material components of this spell are \nthe priest's holy symbol and a twig from a \ntree. \nWater Breathing (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Elemental (Water, Air) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of meet: creak touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe recipient of a water breathing spell is \nable to breathe under water freely for the \nduration of the spell-i.e., one hour for \neach experience level of the caster. The \npriest can divide the base duration between \nmultiple characters. Thus an 8th-level priest \ncan confer this ability to two characters for \nfour hours, four for two hours, eight for one \nhour, etc., to a minimum of 1/2 hour per \ncharacter. \nThe reverse, air breathing, enables water- \nbreathing creatures to survive comfortably \nin the atmosphere for an equal duration. \nNote that neither version prevents the recip- \nient creature from breathing in its natural \nelement. \nWater Walk (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Water) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn + 1 turn/levei \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw None \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \nempower one or more creatures to tread \nupon any liquid as if it were firm ground; \nthis includes mud, quicksand, oil, running \nwater, and snow. The recipient's feet do not \ntouch the surface of the liquid, but oval \ndepressions of his appropriate foot size and \ntwo inches deep are left in the mud or snow. \nThe recipient's rate of movement remains \nnormal. If cast underwater, the recipient is \nborne toward the surface. \nFor every level of the caster above the \nminimum required to cast the spell (5th \nlevel), he can affect another creature. \nThe material components for this spell are \na piece of cork and the priest's holy symbol. \nFourth-Level Spells \nAbJure (Abjuration) \nSphere: Summoning \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of W: 1 creature \nsaving mow: special \nThis spell can send an extrapmar crea- \nture back to its own plane of existence. The \nspell fails against entities of demigod status \nor greater, but their servants or midons can \nbe abjured. If the creature has a specific \n(proper) name, then that must be known \nand used. Any magic reaicrtance ofthesub- \nject must be overcome, or the spell fails. lk \npriest has a 50% chance of success (a roll of \n11 or better on ld20). The roll is adjusted by \nthe difference in level or Hit Dice \nthe caster and the creature being &jd: \nthe number needed is decreased if the priest \nhas more Hit Dice and increased if the crea- \nture has more Hit Dice. If the spell is suc- \ncessful, the creature is instantly hrvkd back \nto its own plane. The afkatd meatwe must \ns&ve a system shodc check. If the ape- \nture does not have a Conetitutian score, the \nrequiredroll is 70% + 2%/Hit Dieor Icvcl. \nThe caster has no control over where in the \ncreature's plane the abjured mature \narrives. If tkc attempt fails, the priest must \ngain another level before another attempt \ncan be made on that particular creature. \nThe spell requires the pdt's holy sym- \nbol, holy water, and some material inimical \nto the creatup. \n. ..... \na"
