Special items, such as hair \nfrom the tail of a ki-rin, or couatl feathers, \ncould also be added to bring the factor up to \n-3 or -4 per item. In contrast, a titan’s hair \nor mistletoe blessed by a druid might lower \nthe factor to -1 with respect to the same \ncreature. If the subject creature successfully \nrolls its saving throw vs. spell, the caster is \nstung by a backlash of energy, suffers 2d6 \npoints of damage, and is stunned for one \nround. \nBigby’s Grasping Hand (Evocation) \n*: 10 yards/level \na-ts: V, S, M \nm: I round/level \nsping hand is a superior ver- \n6th-level Bigby’s forceful hand. It \nman-sized (five feet) to gar- \ngan-ed (21 feet) hand that appears \nand grasps a creature designated by the \ncaster, regardless of what the spellcaster \ndoes or how the opponent tries to escape it. \nThe grasping hand can hold motionless a \ncreature or object of up to 1,ooO pounds \nweight, slow movement to 10 feet per round \nif the creature weighs between 1,OOO and \n4,000 pounds, or slow movement by 50% if \nthe creature weighs up to 16,000 pounds. \nThe hand itself inflicts no damage. The \ngrasping hand has an Armor Class of 0, has \nas many hit points as its caster in full health, \nand vanishes when destroyed. The caster \ncan order it to release a trapped opponent or \ncan dismiss it on command. \nThe material component is a leather \nglove. \nChum Plants (EnchantmentKhann) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe charm plants spell enables the spell- \ncaster to bring under command vegetable \nlife forms and communicate with them. \nThese plants obey instructions to the best.of \ntheir ability. The spell will charm plants in a \n30’ x 10’ area. While the spell does not en- \ndow the vegetation with new abilities, it \ndoes enable the wizard to command the \nplants to use whatever they have in order to \nfulfill his instructions; if the plants in the \narea of effect do have special or unusual \nabilities, these are used as commanded by \nthe wizard. For example, this spell can gen- \nerally duplicate the effects of the 1st-level \npriest spell entangle, if the caster desires. \nThe saving throw applies only to intelligent \nplants, and it is made with a -- 4 penal6 to \nthe die roll. \nThe material components of the soell are \na pinch of humu \ntwig or leaf. \nr: and a \nControl Undead (Necromancy) \nRange: 60 feet \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3d4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: ld6 undead \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell enables the wizard to command \nld6 undead creatures for a short period of \ntime. Upon casting the spell, the wizard se- \nlects one point within range of the spell. \nThose undead nearest to this point are af- \nfected, until either undead equal in Hit Dice \nto the caster‘s level or six undead are af- \nfected. Undead with 3 Hit Dice or less are \nautomatically controlled. Those of greater \nHit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. \nspell, which if successful negates the attempt \nto control that creature. Regardless of the \nsuccess or failure of the saving throw, each \ncreature required to make a check counts to- \nward the Hit Dice limit of the spell. \nThose creatures under the control of the \nwizard can be commanded by the caster if \nthey are within hearing range. There is no \ntelepathic communication between the \ncaster and the controlled undead. There is \nno language requirement either. Even if \ncommunication is impossible, the con- \ntrolled undead do not attack the spellcaster. \nAt the end of the spell, the controlled un- \ndead revert to their normal behaviors. \nThose not mindless will remember the con- \ntrol exerted by the wizard. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nsmall piece each of bone and raw meat. \nDelayed Blast Fireball (Evocation) \nRange: 100 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nkea of Effect: 20-foot-radius globe \nSaving Throw: 1/z \nThis spell creates a fireball, with a + 1 bo- \nius to each of its dice of damage, which re- \neases its blast anywhere from instantly to \nive rounds later, according to the command \n:iven by the wizard. In &her respects, the \nlpell is the same as the 3rd-level spell fire- \ntall. \nDrawmij’s Instant Summons \n(ConjuratiodSummonhg) \nRange: Infinite + special \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 1 small object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard tele- \nports some desired item from virtually any \nlocation directly to his hand. The single ob- \nject can be no longer in any dimension than \na sword, can have no more weight than a \nshield (about eight pounds), and it must be \nnonliving. To prepare this spell, the wizard \nmust hold a gem of not less than 5,000 gp \nvalue in his hand and utter all but the final \nword of the conjuration. He then must \ncrush this gem and utter the final word. The \ndesired item is then transported instantly \ninto the spellcaster‘s right or left hand as he \ndesires. The item must have been previously \ntouched during the initial incantation and \nspecificaIly named; only that particular \nitem is summoned by the spell. The special \nIf the item is in the passessi \ncreature, the spell does not \ncaster knows wh \nthe summons is \nmoned from othe \n(not necessarily the physical grasp) of an- \nother creature. For each level of expaience \nabove the 14th, the wizard is able to sum- \nmon a desired item from one plane farther \nremoved from the plane he is in at the time \nthe spell is cast (one plane away at 14th \nlevel, two planes away at 15th. etc.) Thus, a \nwizard Qf 16th level could cast the spell even \nif the desired item was on the second layer of \none of the outer planes, but at 14th level the \nwizard would be able to summon the item \nonly if it were no farther than one of the in- \nner planes, the Ethereal plane, or the AstraI \nplane (see Manual of the Runes). Note that \nspecial wards or barriers, or factors that \nblock the teleport or plane shift spells, may \nalso block the operation of this spell. Ob- \njects in Leomunds secret chest cannot be re- \ncovered by using this spell. \nNote: If the item is wizard marked, it can \nbe summoned from anywhere on the same \nplane unless special local conditions \nFurthermore, the details of the locat \nthe item are more specific, \nmore easily traceable with \nscrying magic. \n183"
