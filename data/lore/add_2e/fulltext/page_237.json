All creatures in the 10-foot- \ndiameter area of effect must roll successful \nsaving throws vs. spell or be blinded for ld3 \nrounds, those using infravision at the time \nfor 2d4 rounds. Creatures to whom sunlight \nis harmful or unnatural suffer permanent \nblindness if the saving throw is failed, and \nare blinded for 2d6 rounds if the saving \nthrow is successful. Those within its area of \neffect, as well as creatures within 20 feet of \nits perimeter, lose any infravision capabili- \nties for ld4 + 1 rounds. \nUndead caught within the sunray’s area of \neffect receive 8d6 points of damage, one- \nhalf if a saving throw vs. spell is successful. \nrhose undead 20 feet to either side of the \nSUNay’S area of effect receive 3d6 points of \ndamage, no damage if a save is successful. \nIn addition, the ray may result in the total \ndestruction of those undead specifically af- \nfected by sunlight, if their saving throws are \nfailed. The ultraviolet light generated by the \nspell inflicts damage on fungoid creatures \nand subterranean fungi just as if they were \nundead, but no saving throw is allowed. \nThe material components are an aster \nseed and a piece of aventurine feldspar (sun- \nstone). \nSymbol (Conjuration/Summoning) \nSphere: Guardian \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe priest casting this spell inscribes a \nglowing symbol in the air or upon any sur- \nface, according to his desire. Any creature \nlooking at the completed symbol within 60 \nfeet must roll a successful saving throw vs. \nspell or suffer the effect. The symbol glows \nfor one turn for each experience level of the \ncaster. The particular symbol used is se- \nlected by the caster at the time of casting. \nThe caster will not be affected by his own \nsymbol. One of the following effects is cho- \nsen by the caster: \nHopelessness: Creatures seeing it must turn \nback in dejection or surrender to capture \nor attack unless they roll successful sav- \ning throws vs. spell. Its effects last for \n3d4 turns. \nPain: Creatures affected suffer -4 penalties \nto their attack rolls and -2 penalties to \ntheir Dexterity ability scores due to \nwracking pains. The effects last for 2d10 \nturns. \nPersuasion: Creatures seeing the symbol be- \ncome of the same alignment as and \nfriendly to the priest who scribed the \nsymbol for ld20 turns unless a saving \nthrow vs. spell is successful. \nThe material components of this spell are \nmercury and phosphorus (see 8th-level wiz- \nard spell, symbol). \nTransmute Metal to Wood (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Earth) \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 metal object \nSaving Throw: Special \nThe transmute metal to wood spell en- \nables the caster to change an object from \nmetal to wood. The volume of metal cannot \nexceed a maximum weight of 10 pounds per \nexperience level of the priest. Magical ob- \njects made of metal are 90% resistant to the \nspell, and those on the person of a creature \nreceive the creature’s saving throw as well. \nArtifacts and relics cannot be transmuted. \nNote that only a wish spell or similar magic \ncan restore a transmuted object to its metal- \nlic state. Otherwise, for example, a metal \ndoor changed to wood would be forever- \nmore a wooden door. \nWind Walk (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Air) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the priest, and possibly \none or two other persons, to alter the sub- \nstance of his body to a cloud-like vapor. A \nmagical wind then wafts the priest along at a \nmovement rate of 60, or as slow as 6, as the \nspellcaster wills. The wind walk spell lasts \nas long as the priest desires, up to a maxi- \nmum duration of six turns (one hour) per ex- \nperience level of the caster. For every 8 \nlevels of experience the priest has attained, \nup to 24, he is able to touch another person \nand carry that person, or those persons, \nalong on the wind walk. Persons wind \nwalking are not invisible, but rather appear \nmisty and translucent. If fully clothed in \nwhite, they are 80% likely to be mistaken \nfor clouds, fog, vapors, etc. The priest can \nregain his physical form as desired, each \nchange to and from vaporous form requir- \ning five rounds. While in vaporous form, \nthe priest and companions are hit only by \nmagic or magical weaponry, though they \nmay be subject to high winds at the DMs \ndiscretion. No spellcasting is possible in va- \nporous form. \nThe material components of this spell are \nfire and holy water."
