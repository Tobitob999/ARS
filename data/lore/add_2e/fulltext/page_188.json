    "text": "Wizard Spells (7th Level) \n&juration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Up to 3 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nThis powerful abjuration causes spells \ncat against the wizard to rebound on the \noriginal caster. This includes spells cast \nfrvm scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, \nbut specifically excludes the following: area \ndkets that are not centered directly upon \n6. protected wizard, spell effects delivered \n%y touch, and spell effects from devices such \nrd, staves, etc. Thus a light spell cast \n(ryM the protected wizard could be \nkd bdk upon and possibly blind the \nthe same spell would be unaf- \nan area within which \nis standing. \nt\\9 ten spell levels are affected \nbyem. ’i$e exact number is secretly \nndL$ by the DM; the player never knows \nfor certain how effective the spell is. \nA spell may be only partially turned- \ndivide the number of remaining levels that \ncan be turned by the spell level of the incom- \ning spell to see what fraction of the effect is \nturned-the remainder affects the caster. \nFor example, if an incoming fireball is cen- \ntered on a wizard with one level of turning \nleft. This means that V3 of the fireball af- \nfects the protected wizard, 1/3 affects the \ncaster, and each is the center of a fireball ef- \nfect. If the rolled damage is 40 points, the \nprotected wizard receives 27 points of dam- \nage and the caster suffers 13. Both (and any \ncreatures in the respective areas) can roll \nsaving throws vs. spell for half damage. \nPartially turned hold or pady~k spells will \nslow those who are 50% or more affected. \nIf the protected wizard and a spellcasting \nattacker both have spell turning effects op- \nerating, a resonating field is created that has \nDlOO \nRON Effect \n01-70 \n7l-80 \n81-97 \n98-00 \n- \n1 \nI \nL. \nthe following effects: \nSpell drains away without effect \nSpell affects both equally at full \nBoth turning dfects are rendered \nnon-functional for Id4 turns \nBoth casters go through a rift \ninto the Positive Material plane \nThe material component for the spell is a \ndamage \nsmall silver mirror. \nStatue (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen a statue spell is cast, the wizard or \nother creature is apparently turned to solid \nstone, along with any garments and equip- \nment worn or carried. The initial transfor- \nmation from flesh to stone requires one full \nround after the spell is cast. During this ini- \ntial transformation, the creature must roll a \nsaving throw of 82% or less, with -1 de- \nducted from the dice roll for each point of \nConstitution, so an 18 Constitution grants \ncertain success. Failure indicates system \nshock and death. Thereafter the creature \ncan withstand any hpection and appear to \nbe a stone statue, although a faint magic is \ndetected from the stone if it is checked for. \nDespite being in this condition, the petri- \nfied individual can see, hear, and smell nor- \nmally. Feeling is limited to those sensations \nthat can affect the granite-hard substance of \nthe individual’s body-i.e., chipping is \nequal to a slight wound, but breaking off \none of the statue’s arms is serious damage. \nThe individual under the magic of a \nstatue spell can return to his normal state in- \nstantly, act, and then return to the statue \nstate, if he so desires, as long as the spell du- \nration is in effect. \nThe material components of this spell are \nlime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an \niron bar, such as a nail or spike. \nTeleport Without Error (Alteration) \nRange Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is similar to the teleport spell. \nThe caster is able to transpart himself, along \nwith the material weight noted for a teleport \nspell, to any known location in his home \nplane with no chance for error. The spell \nalso enables the caster to travel to other \nplanes of existence, but any such plane is, at \nbest, ”studied carefully.” This assumes that \nthe caster has, in fact, actually been to the \nplane and carefully perused an area for an \neventual teleportution without error spell. \nThe table for the teleport spell is used, with \nthe caster’s knowledge of the area to which \ntransportation is desired used to determine \nchance of error. (Exception: See the 9th- \nlevel wizard spell, succor.) The caster can \ndo nothing else the round that he appears \nfrom a teleport. \nVi.mirh (Aheration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 object \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen the wizard employs this spell, tw \ncauses an object to vanish (i.e., to be tek- \nported as if by a telsport spell) if it wei+ \nno more than 50 pounds per caster level. \nThus a 14th-level caster can vanish, and \ncause to reappear at a desired location, an. \nobject up to 700 pounds in weight. The max- \nimum volume of material that can be af- \nfected is three cubic feet per level of \nexperience. Thus, both weight and volume \nlimit the spell. An object that exceeds either \nlimitation is unaffected and the spell fa&. \nIf desired, a vanished object can be placed \ndeep within the Ethereal plane. Ln this case, \nthe point from which the object vanished re \nmains faintly magical until the item is re- \ntrieved. A successful dispel magic spell cast \non the point will bring the vanished item \nback from the Ethereal plane. Note that \ncreatures and magical forces cannot be \nmade to vanish. \nThere is a 1 % chance that a vanished item \nwill be disintegrated instead. There is also a \n1 % chance that a creature from the Et- \nplane is able to gain access to the Prime Ma- \nterial plane through the vanished item’s con- \nnection. \nVision (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nAt such time as the wizard wishes to gain \nsupernatural guidance, he cast6 a visiOrr \nspell, calling upon whatever power he ole- \nsires aid from, and askirlg the question far \nwhich a vision is to be given in answer. Two \nsix-sided dite are rolled. If they total 2 to 6, \nthe power is annwed and will cause thewiz- \nard, by an ultra-powerful geas or quest, to \ndo some service, and no questions are an- \nswered. If the dice total 7 to 9, the power is \nindifferent, and some minor vision, posbi- \nbly unrelated to the question, is given. A \nscore of 10 or better indicates that the vision \nis granted. \nThe material component of the spell is thc \nsacrifice of something valued by the spell- \ncaster or by the power supplicated. The \nmore precious the sacrifice, the better the \nchance of spell success. A very precious \nitem grants a bonus of +1 on the dice, one \nthat is extremely precious adds +2, and a \npriceless item adds + 3. \n187"
