Any gaze \nattack, such as that of a basilisk, eyes of \ncharming, a vampire's gaze, the 6th-level \neyebite spell, and so on, is reflected back \nupon the gazer if the gazer tries to make eye \ncontact with the spellcaster (the spellcaster \nsuffers no effects from the gaze attack). \nSuch creatures receive a saving throw vs. \ntheir own gaze effect. The spell does not \naffect vision or lighting and is not effective \nagainst creatures whose effect comes from \nbeing gazed upon (such as a medusa). Only \nactive gaze attacks are blocked by this spell. \nCrease (Conjuration) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 10' x 10' square area \nSaving Throw: Special \nA grease spell covers a material surface \nwith a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy \nnature. Any creature entering the area or \ncaught in it when the spell is cast must save \nvs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who \nsuccessfully save can reach the nearest non- \ngreased surface by the end of the round. \nThose who remain in the area are allowed a \nsaving throw each round until they escape \nthe area. The DM should adjust saving \nthrows by circumstance; for example, a \ncreature charging down an incline that is \nsuddenly greased has little chance to avoid \nthe effect, but its ability to exit the affected \narea is almost assuredl The spell can also be \nused to create a greasy coating on an item- \na rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. \nMaterial objects not in use are always \naffected by this spell, while creatures wield- \ning or employing items receive a saving \nthrow vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the ini- \ntial saving throw is failed, the creature \nimmediately drops the item. A saving throw \nmust be made each round the creature \nattempts to use the greased item. The caster \ncan end the effect with a single utterance; \notherwise it lasts for three rounds plus one \nround per level. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nbit of pork rind or butter. \nWizard Spells (1 st Level) \nHold Portal (Alteration) \nRange: 20 yards/level \nComponent: V \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 20 square feetllevel \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell magically bars a door, gate, or \nvalve of wood, metal, or stone. The magical \nclosure holds the portal fast, just as if it were \nsecurely closed and locked. Any extra- \nplanar creature (djinn, elemental, etc.) with \n4 or more Hit Dice can shatter the spell and \nburst open the portal. A wizard of 4 or more \nexperience levels higher than the spellcaster \ncan open the held portal at will. A knock \nspell or a successful dispel magic spell can \nnegate the hold portal. Held portals can be \nbroken or physically battered down. \nHypnotism (EnchantmentKhann) \nRange: 5 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe gestures of the wizard, along with his \ndroning incantation, cause ld6 creatures \nwithin the area to become susceptible to a \nsuggestion-a brief and reasonable- \nsounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard \nsuggestion spell). The request must be given \nafter the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that \ntime the success of the spell is unknown. \nNote that the subsequent suggestion is not a \nspell, but simply a vocalized urging (the \ncaster must speak a language the creature \nunderstands for this spell to work). Crea- \ntures that successfully roll their saving \nthrows are not under hypnotic influence. \nThose who are exceptionally wary or hostile \nsave with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is \ncast afan individual creature that meets the \ncaster's gaze, the saving throw is made with \na penalty of -2. A creature that fails its sav- \ning throw does not remember that the caster \nenspelled it. \nIdentify (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 item/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an identify spell is cast, magical \nitems subsequently touched by the wizard \ncan be identified. The eight hours immedi- \nately precedii the casting of the spell must \nbe spent purify@ the items and I*emoving \ninfluences that would corrupt and blur their \nmagical auras. If this period is interrupted, \nit must be begun again. When the spell is \ncast, each item must be handled in turn by \nthe wizard. Any consequences of this han- \ndling fall fully upon the wizard and may end \nthe spell, although the wizard is allowed \nany applicable saving throw. \ncovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wiz- \nard could attempt to determine the nature of \nfive different items, five different functions \nof a single item, or any combination of \ntwo). If any attempt at readipg fails, \ncaster cannot learn any more about that \nitem until he advances a level. Note that \nsome items, such as special magical tomes, \ncannot be identified with this spell. \nThe item never reveals its exact attack or \ndamage bonuses, although the fact that it has \nfew or many bonuses canbe determined. If it \nhascharges,onlyageneralindicationdthe \n.' \nuntil full Constitution is restored, \ntakes 24 hours (one point per three hours f \nan unconscious character). \nThe material components of this spell are \na pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl \nfeather steeped in wine, with the infusion \ndrunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is \npowdered and added to the infusion, the \ndivination becomes much more potent: \nexact bonuses or charges can be determined, \nand the functions of a multi-functional item \ncan be learned from a single reading. At the \nDMs option, certain properties of an arti- \nfact or relic might also be learned. \nJump (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Id3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe individual touched when this spell is I cast is empowered to leap once per round \nfor the e swll. Leaps can be up"
