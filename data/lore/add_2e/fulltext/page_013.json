It is a \nfunction of Strength and may be found in \nTable 1. \nMelee - combat in which characters are \nfighting in direct contact, such as with \nswords, claws, or fists, as opposed to fight- \ning with missile weapons or spells. \nMissile combat - combat involving the use \nof weapons that shoot missiles or items that \ncan be thrown. Because the combat is not \n\"toe-to-toe,\" the rules are slightly different \nthan those for regular combat. \nMovement rate -a number used in calculat- \ning how far and how fast a character can \nmove in a round. This number is in units of \n10 yards per round outdoors, but it repre- \nsents 10 feet indoors. Thus, an MR of 6 is 60 \nyards per round in the wilderness, but only \n60 feet per round in a dungeon. \nMR - abbreviation for movement rate \n(9.v.). \nMulti-class character - a demihuman who \nimproves in two or more classes at the same \ntime by dividing experience points between \nthe different classes. Humans cannot be \nmulti-classed. \nMythos (pl. mythoi) - a complete body of \nbelief particular to a certain time or place, \nincluding the pantheon of its gods. \nNeutrality - a philosophical position, or \nalignment, of a character that is between be- \nlief in good or evil, order or chaos. \nNon*ayer character - any character con- \ntrolled by the DM instead of a player. \nNPC - abbreviation for non-player charac- \nter (q.v.). \nOpen doors roll - the roll of a 2kided die to \nsee if a character succeeds in opening a \nheavy or stuck door or performing a similar \ntask.

ROF) -number of times a \nmissile-firing or thrown weapon can be shot \nin a round. \nReaction adjustment - a bonus added to or \npenalty subtracted from a die roll used in \ndetermining the success of a character's \naction.
