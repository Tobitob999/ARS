Indeed, the little knowledge the \ncharacter has may lead to .overconfidence \nand doom1 \nSmlmming: A character with swimming \nproficiency knows how to swim and can- \nmove according to the rules given in the \nSwimming section (page 120). Those with- \nout this proficiency carinot swim. They can \nhold their breath and float, but they cannot \nmove themselves about in the wat< \nTightrope WWs The character can \nattempt to walk narrow ropes or beams \nwith greater than normal chances of suc- \ncess. He can negotiate any narrow surface \nnot angled up or down greater than 45 \ndegrees. Each round the character can walk \n60 feet. One proficiency check is made eve- \nry 60 feet (or part thereof), with failure indi- \ncating a fall. TRe check is made with a -10 \npenalty to the ability score if the surface is \none inch or less inwidth (a rope), a -5 pen- \nalty if two inches to six inches wide, and \nunm& if seven inches to 12 inches \nwide. Wider than one foot requires nacheck \nfM pr&cient characters under normal cir- \ncumstances. Every additional proficiency \nspnr on tightrope walking reduces these \npenalties by 1. Use of a balancing rod reduc- \nes the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations in \nWline increases the penaltip by 2 to 6. \nTlte character can attempt to fight while \non a tightrope, but he suffers a -5 penalty \nto uttadc roll ad must roll a successful \npsoHcisncy check at the beginnii of each \nround to avoid falling off. Since the charac- \nter cannot maneuver, he gains no adjust- \nments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he \nis struck while on the rope, he must roll an \nimmdiate proficiency check to retain his \nbalance. \n'hew Characters with tracking profi- \n. ciency are able to follow the trail of crea- \ntures and characters across most types of \nterrain. Characters who are not rangers roll \na proficiency check with a -6 penalty to \ntheir ability scores; rangers have no penalty \nto their ability scores. In addition, other \nmodifiers are also applied to the attempt, \naccording to Table 39. \nTable 3% TRACKING MODIFIERS \nTerrain \nSoft or muddy ground \nThick brush, vines, or reeds \nOccasional signs of passage, dust \nNormal ground, wood floor \nRocky ground or shallow water \nEvery two creatures in the group \nEvery 12 hours since trail was made \nEvery hour of rain, snow, or sleet \nPoor lighting (moon or starlight) \nTracked party attempts to hide trail \nMod. \n+4 \n+3 \n+2 \n0 \n- 10 \n+1 \n-1 \n-5 \n-6 \n-5 \nThe modifiers in Table 39 are cum- \nulative-total the modifiers for all condi- \ntions that apply and combine that with the \ntracker's Wisdom score to get the modified \nchance to track. \nFor example, if Thule's Wisdom score is \n16 and he is trying to track through mud \n(+4), at night (-6), during a sleet storm \n(-5), his chance to track is 9 (16 + 4 -6 \n-5). (Thule is a ranger, so he does not suffer \nthe -6 penalty for non-rangers tracking.) \nFor tracking to succeed, the creature \ntracked must leave some type of trail. Thus \nit is virtually impossible to track flying or \nnoncorporeal creatures. The DM may allow \nthis in rare instances, but he should also \nassign substantial penalties to the attempt. \nTo track a creature, the character must \nfirst find the trail. Indoors, the tracker must \nhave seen the creature in the last 30 minutes \nand must begin tracking from the place last \nseen. Outdoors, the tracker must either \nhave seen the creature, have eyewitness \nreports of its recent movement (\"Yup, we \nsaw them ora just high-tail it up that trail \nthere not but yesterday.\"), or must have \nobvious evidence that the creature is in the \narea (such as a well-used game trail). If these \nconditions are met, a proficiency check is \nrolled. Success means a trail has been \nfound. Failure means no trail is found. \nAnother attempt cannot be made until the \nabove conditions are met again under differ- \nent circumstances. \nOnce the trail is found, additional profi- \nciency checks are rolled for the following \nsituations: \n* The chance to track decreases (terrain, \nrain, creatures leaving the group, darkness, \netc.). \nA second track crosses the first. \n* The party resumes tracking after a halt \n(to rest, eat, fight, etc.). \nOnce the tracker fails a proficiency check, \nanother check can be rolled after spending \nat least one hour searching the area for new \nsigns. If this check is. fafed, no further \nattempts can be made. If several trackers are \nfolEovving a trail, a + 1 bonus is added to the \nability score of the most adept tracker. Once \nhe loses the trail, it is lost to all. \nIf the modifiers lower the chance to track \nbelow 0 (e.g., the modifiers are -11 and the \ncharacter's Wisdom is IO), the trail io totally \nlost to that character and further tracking is \nimpossible- (even if the chance later \nimproves). Other characters may be able to \ncontinue tracking, but that character can- \nnot. \nA tracking charatter can also attempt to \nidentify the type of creatures being followed \nand the approximate number by rolling a \nproficiency check. All the normal tracking \nmodifiers apply. One identifying check can \nbe rolled each time a check is rolled to fol- \nlow the trail. A succedul check identifies \nthe creatures (provided the character has \nsome knowledge of that type of creature) \nand gives a rough estimate of their numbers. \nJust how accurate this estimate is depends \non the DM. \n64 \nWhen following a trail, the character (and \nthose with him) must slow down, the speed \nhendinst on the character's modificd \n&e tokk as found from Table 39. \nTabk 4a MOVEMENT WHILE \nTRACKING \nChance to Track Movement Rke \n1-6 1/4 normal \n7-14 1/2 normal \n14 or greater 3/4 normal \nIn the earlier example, Thule has a mc \nfied tracking chance of 9,so he moves ai \nhis normal movement rate. \nTnsnWsgt The character is practiced in \nall manner of aqrobatics-dive, roils, som- \nersaults, handstands, flips, ctc. Tumbling \ncan only be performed while burdened with \nlight encumbrance or less. Aside from enter- \ntaining, the character with tumbling profi- \nciency can improve hi5 Armor Class by 4 \nagainst attacks directed solely at him in any \nround of combat, provided he has the initia- \ntive and foregoes d attacks that mud. \nWhen in manned combat he can improve \nhis attack roll by 2. \nOn a 6uca88fu1 proficiency check, he suf- \nfers only one-hdf the normal damage from \nfalls of 60 feet or less and none from falls of \n10 feet or less. Falls from greater heights \nresult in normal damage. \nVentriloquirm: The character has kd \nthe secrets of \"throwing his voice.\" Al- \nthough not actually making sound come \nfrom somewhere else (like the spell), the \ncharacter can deceive others into bebbg \nthis to be so.
