    "text": "Priest Spells (5th Level) \nThe reverse of the spell, dispel good, \nfunctions against summoned or enchanted \ncreatures of good alignment or creatures \nthat have been sept to aid the cause of good. \nThe material components for this spell are \nthe priest’s religious object and holy (or un- \nholy) water. \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: %foot radius \nSaving Throw: 112 \nWhen the priest calls down a flame strike \nspell, a vertical column of fire roars down- \nward in the exact location called for by the \ncaster. Any creature within the area of effect \nof a flame strike must roll a saving throw vs. \nspell. Failure means the creature sustains \n6d8 points of damage; otherwise, the dam- \nage is halved. \nThe material component of this spell is a \npinch of sulphur. \nby 30-foot-high ~01~mn \nInsect Plague (Conjuration6ummoning) \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 roundsAeve1 \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 180’ diameter, 60’ high cloud \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast by the priest, a \nhorde of creeping, hopping, and flying in- \nsects gather and swarm in a thick cloud. (In \nan environment free of normal insects, the \nspell fails.) The insects obscure vision, limit- \ning it to 10 feet. Spellcasting within the \ncloud is impossible. Creatures in the insect \nplague sustain 1 point of damage for each \nround they remain within, due to the bites \nand stings of the insects, regardless of Ar- \nmor Class. Invisibility is no protection. All \ncreatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will auto- \nmatically move at their fastest possible \nspeed in a random direction until they are \nmore than 240 yards away from the insects. \nCreatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must \ncheck morale; failure means they run as de- \nscribed above. \nHeavy smoke drives off insects within its \nbounds. Fire also drives insects away; a wall \nof fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently \ncast insect plague outside its confines, but a \nfireball simply clears insects from its blast \narea for one round. A single torch is ineffec- \ntive against this vast horde of insects. Light- \nning, cold, or ice are likewi? ineffective, \nwhile a strong wind that covers the entire \nplague area disperses the insects and ends \nthe spell. The plague lasts two rounds for \neach level of the caster, and thereafter the \ninsects disperse. \nThe insects swarm in an area that centers \naround a summoning point determined by \nthe spellcaster; the point can be up to 120 \nyards away from the priest. The insect \nplague does not move thereafter for as long \nas it lasts. Note that the spell can be coun- \ntered by a dispel magic spell. \nThe material components of this spell are \na few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, \nand a smear of fat. \nMagic Font (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 hour \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe spell causes a holy water font to serve \nas a scrying device. The spell does not func- \ntion unless the priest is in good standing \nwith his deity. The basin of holy water be- \ncomes similar to a crystal bull. For each vial \nof capacity of the basin, the priest may scry \nfor one round, up to a maximum of one \nhour; thus, the duration of the mugic font \nspell is directly related to the size of the holy \nwater receptacle. The DM will know the \nchances of a character being able to detect \nSnying. \nThe priest’s holy symbol and the font and \nits trappings are not consumed by the spell. \nMoonbeam (Evocation, Alteration) \nSphere: Sun \nRange: 60 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nSaving Throw: None \nArea of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere \n(plus special) \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster is able to \ncause a beam of soft, pale light to strike \ndownward from overhead and illuminate \nwhatever area he is pointing at. The light is \nexactly the same as moonlight, so that col- \nors other than shades of black, gray, or \nwhite are vague. The spellcaster can easily \nmake the moonbeam move to any area that \nhe can see and point to. This makes the spell \nan effective way to spotlight something, an \nopponent, for example. While the moon- \nbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a \ncreature centered in a moonbeam is most \ncertainly visible. The reflected light from \nthis spell enables dim visual perception 10 \nyards beyond the area of effect, but it does \nnot shed a telltale glow that would negate \nsurprise. The light does not adversely affect \ninfravision. The caster can dim the beam to \nnear darkness if desired. The beam has, in \naddition, all the properties of true moon- \nlight and can induce a lywthropic change \n(while in the beam), unless your DM rules \notherwise. \nThe material components are several \nseeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of \nopalescent feldspar (moonstone). \nPass Plant (Alteration) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 8 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy using this spell, the caster is able to en- \nter a tree and move from inside it to inside \nanother tree of the same type that lies in ap \nproximately the &&ion &red by the \nspell user and is within the range shown in \nthe following table. \nType of Tree \nOak \nAsh \nYew \nElm \nLinden \ndeciduous \nconiferous \nother \nRango of Anea of Effect \n600 yards \n540 yards \n-Yards \n420 yards \n360 yards \n300 Yh \n240 yards \n180 yards \nThe tree entered and that receiving the \ncaster must be of the same type, must both \nbe living, and of girth at least equpl to that \nof the caster. Note that if the caster enters a \ntree, an ash, for example, and wishes to pass \nnorth as far as possible (540 yards), but the \nonly appropriate ash in range is to the \nsouth, the caster will pass to the ash in the \nsouth. The pass plant spell functions 80 that \nthe movement takes only one round. The \ncaster can, at his option, remain within the \nreceiving tree for a maximum of OM rod \nper level of experience. Othawise, h can \nstep forth immediately. Should no like tree \nbe in rahge, the caster simply remains \nwithin the tree, does not pass elsewhere, \nand must step forth in the appropriate num- \nber of rounds. If the occupied tree is \nchopped down or burned, the caster is dain \nif he does not exit befope the process is com- \nplete. \n223"
