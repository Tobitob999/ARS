The area of light \nthus caused is equal in brightness to torch- \nlight, Objects in darkness beyond this \nsphere can be seen, at best, as vague and \nshadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a \npoint selected by the caster, and he must \nhave a litte of sight or unobstructed path to \nthat point when the spell is cast. Light can \nspring from air, rock, metal, wood, or \nalmost any similar substance. The effect is \nimmobile unless it is specifically centered on \na movable object or mobile creature. If this \nspell is cast upon a creature, any applicable \nmagic resistance and saving throws must be \nrolled. Successful resistance negates the \nspell, while a successful saving throw indi- \ncates that the spell is centered immediately \nbehind the creature, rather than upon the \ncreature itself. A light spell centered on the \nvisual organs of a creature blinds it, reduc- \ning its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 \nand worsening its Armor Class by 4. The \ncaster can extinguish the light at any time by \nuttering a single word. Light spells are not \ncumulative-multiple castings do not pro- \nvide a brighter light. \nThe spell is reversible, causing darkness \nin the same area and under the same condi- \ntions as the light spell, but with half the \nduration. Magical darkness is equal to that \nof an unlit interior room-pitch darkness. \nAny normal light source or magical light \nsource of lesser intensity than full daylight \ndoes not function in magical darkness. A \ndnrkness spell cast directly against a light \nspell cancels both, and vice versa. \nLocate Animals or Plants \n(Divination) \nSphere: Divination (Animal, Plant) \nRange: 100 yards + 20 yd./level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 20-foot-wide path 20 yards \nlong/level \nSaving Throw: None \nThe caster can find the direction and dis- \ntance of any one type of animal or plant he \ndesires. The caster, facing in a direction, \nthinks of the animal or plant, and then \nknows if any such animal or plant is within \nrange. If so, the exact distance and approxi- \nmate number present is learned. During \neach round of the spell's duration, the caster \ncan face in only one direction, i.e., only a \n20-foot-wide path can be known. The spell \nlasts one round per level of experience of the \ncaster, while the length of the path is 100 \nyards plus 20 yards per level of experience. \n(At the DMs option, some casters may be \nable to locate only those animals [or plants] \nassociated closely with their own mythos.) \nThe material component is the caster's \nholy symbol. \nWhile the exact chance of locating a spe- \ncific type of animal or plant depends on the \ndetails and circumstances of the locale, the \ngeneral frequency of the subject can be used \nas a guideline: common SO%, uncom- \nmon = 30%' rare = 15%, and very rare = \n5 % . Most herbs grow in temperate regions, \nwhile most spices grow in tropical regions. \nMost plants sought as spell components or \nfor magical research are rare or very rare. \nThe results of this spell are always deter- \nmined by the DM. \n'cal Stone (Enchantment) \nSphere: Combat \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy using this spell, the priest can tempo- \nrarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no \nlarger than sling bullets. The magical stones \ncan then be hurled or slung at an opponent. \nIf hurled, they can be thrown up to 30 \nyards, and all three can be thrown in one \nround. The character using them must roll \nnormally to hit, although the magic of the \nstones enables any character to be proficient \nwith them. The stones are considered +1 \nweapons for determining if a creature can be \nstruck (those struck only by magical weap- \nons, for instance), although they do not \nhave an attack or damage bonus. Each stone \nthat hits inflicts ld4 points of damage, 2d4 \npoints against undead. The magic in each \nstone lasts for but one-half hour or until \nused. \nThe material components are the priest's \nholy symbol and three small pebbles, \nunworked by tools or magic of any type. \n11 \nPass without mace \n(EnchantmenKhann) \nSphere: Plant \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 tum/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, the recipient can \nmove through any type of terrain-mud, \nsnow, dust, etc.-and leave neither foot- \nprints nor mt. The area that is pad over \nradiates magic for ld6 turns after the affect- \ned creature passes. Thus, tracking a person \nor other creature covered by this spell is \nimpossible by normal means. Of course, \nintelligent tracking techniques, such as \nusing a spiral search pattern, can result in \nthe trackers picking up the trail at a point \nwhere the spell has worn off. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nsprig of pine or evergreen, which must be \nburned and the ashes powdered and scat- \ntered when the spell is cast. \nProtection From Evll (Abjuration) \nReversible \nSphere: Protection \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounddevei \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, it creates a magical \nbarrier around the recipient at a dmtance of \none foot. The barrier moves with the recipi- \nent and has three major effects: \nFirst, all attacks made by evil or evilly \nenchanted creatures against the protected \ncreature receive a penalty of -2 to each \nattack roll, and any saving throws caused \nby such attacks are made by the protected \ncreature with a +2 bonus. \nSecond, any attempt to exercise mental \ncontrol over the protected creature (if, for \nexample, it had been charmed by a vampire) \nor to invade and take over its mind (as by a \nghost's magic jar attack) is blocked this \nspell. Note that the protection does not prr- \nvent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but \nit does prevent the vampire from exercising \nmental control through the barrier. Like- \nwise, an outside life force is merely kept out, \nand would not be expelled if in place before \nthe protection was cast. \nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact \nby creatures of an extraplanar or conjured \nnature (such as aerial servants, elementals, \nimps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water \nweirds, xorn, and others). This causes the \nnatural (body) weapon attacks of such crea- \ntures to fail and the creature to recoil if such \n20 1"
