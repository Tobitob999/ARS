    "text": "The party could stand about in shirt sleeves \nduring the worst blizzard (although it would \nbe raining on them) or make ice for their \ndrinks during a scorching heat wave. \nThe spell also provides protection from \nintense normal and magical attacks. If the \nextreme of temperature is beyond what \ncould be affected by the spell (a searing blast \nof a fireball or the icy chill of a white \ndragon), the spell reduces the damage \ncaused by 5 points for every level of the \ncaster. Normal saving throws are still \nallowed, and the reduction is taken after the \nsaving throw is made or failed. Once struck \nby such an attack, the spell immediately col- \nlapses. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nstrip of willow bark (to lower temperatures) \nor raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures). \n. \nCure Serious Wounds (Necromancy) \nReversible \nSphere: Healing \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is a more potent version of the \ncure light wounds spell. When laying his \nhand upon a creature, the priest heals \n2d8+1 points of wound or other injury \ndamage to the creature's body. This healing \ncannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or \nextraplanar creatures. \nCause serious wounds, the reverse of the \nspell, operates similarly to the cause light \nwounds spell, the victim having to be touch- \ned first. If the touch is successful, 2d8+1 \npoints of damage are inflicted. \nDetect Lie (Divination) \nReversible \nI \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nA priest who casts this spell is immedi- \nately able to determine if the subject crea- \nture deliberately and knowingly speaks a \nlie. It does not reveal the truth, uncover \nunintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily \nreveal evasions. The subject receives a sav- \ning throw vs. spell, which is adjusted only \nby the Wisdom of the caster-e.g., if the \ncaster has a Wisdom of 18, the subject's sav- \ning throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5). \nThe material component for the detect lie \nspell is one gp worth of gold dust. \nThe spell's reverse; undetectable lie, pre- \nvents the magical detection of lies spoken by \nthe creature for 24 hours. \nThe reverse requires brass dust as its \nmaterial component. \nDivination (Divination) \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nA divination spell is used to gamer a use- \nful piece of advice concerning a specific \ngoal, event, or activity that will occur with- \nin a one-week period. This can be as simple \nas a short phrase, or it might take the form \nof a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the \naugury spell, this gives a specific piece of \nadvice. For example, if the question is \"Will \nwe do well if we venture to the third level?\" \nand a terrible troll guarding 10,OoO gp and a \nshield +I lurks near the entrance to the \nlevel (the DM estimates the party could beat \nthe troll after a hard fight) the divination \nresponse might be: \"Ready oil and open \nflame light your way to wealth.\" In all cases, \nthe DM controls what information is \nreceived and whether additional divinations \nwill supply additional information. Note \nthat if the information is not acted upon, the \nconditions probably change so that the \ninformation is no longer useful (in the exam- \nple, the troll might move away and take the \ntreasure with it). \nThe base chance for a correct divination \nis 60%, plus 1 I for each experience level of \nthe priest casting the spell. The DM makes \nadjustments to this base chance considering \nthe actions being divined (if, for example, \nunusual precautions against the spell have \nbeen taken). If the dice roll is failed, the cast- \ner knows the spell failed, unless specific \nmagic yielding false information is at work. \nThe material components of the divina- \ntion spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, \nand the holy symbol of the priest. If an \nunusually important divination is attempt- \ned, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, \njewelry, or magical items may be required. \nFree Action (Abjuration, Enchantment) \nSphere: Charm \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the creature touched to \nmove and attack normally for the duration \nJf the spell, even under the influence of \n217 \nbreathing without further appropriate \nic. \nThe material component is a leather \nthong, bound around the arm or similar \nappendage, which disintegrates when th6 \nspell expires. \nGiant Insect (Alteration) \nReversible \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: 1 to 6 insects \nSaving Throw: None \ngrown to the same size. The number of \ninsects and the size to which they can be \ngrown depend upon the priest's level: \nFor example, an 8th-level priest can grow \nthree insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 \nHit Dice, or nine insects to 1 hit die. Hying \ninsects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a \nrider of human size (assume that such can \ncarry 80 pounds per Hit Die). \nIf the casting is interrupted for any rea- \nson, OF if the insects are currently subject to \nany other magical effect (including this \none), the insects die and the spell is ruined. \nThe DM decides how many normal insects \nof what type are available; this is often a \ngreater limitation on the spell than the limits \nabove. \nIf the insect created by this spell matches \nL, one attack, and inflicts Id4 \nlamage per Hit Die."
