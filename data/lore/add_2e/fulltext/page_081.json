    "text": "Chapter 7: Magic \nSome of the most powerful weapons player \ncharacters have at their disposal in the \nAD&W game are magical spells. Through \nspells a player character can control earth- \nquakes, call lightning out of the sky, heal \ngrievous injuries, hurl explosive balls of \nfire, create barriers of stone, fire, and ice, \nand learn secrets long forgotten. These are \nonly a few of the things player characters \ncan do once they master the strange lore of \nspells. \nNot every character is capable of casting \nspells, however. This ability requires a cer- \ntain amount of aptitude, depending on the \ntype of spells cast. Wizard spells are best \nmastered by those with keen intelligence \nand patience for the long years of study that \nare required. Priest spells call for inner \npeace and faith and an intense devotion to \none's calling. \nThe vast majority of people in a fantasy \ncampaign lack these traits or have never had \nthe opportunity to develop them. The baker \nmay be a bright and clever fellow, but, fol- \nlowing in his father's footsteps, he has spent \nhis life learning the arts of bread making. \nThere has simply been no time in his life for \nthe study of old books and crumbling \nscrolls. The hard-working peasant may be \npious and upright in his faith, but he lacks \nthe time for the contemplative and scholarly \ntraining required of a priest. So it is only a \nfortunate few who have the ability and \nopportunity to learn the arcane lore of \nspellcasting. \nA few character classes have a limited \nability to cast spells. The ranger, through his \nclose association with nature, is able to cast \na few spells, though his choices are limited \nto his natural inclinations. The paladin, \nthrough his devotion and humility, can use \nsome of the spells of the priest. The bard, \nthrough luck, happenstance, curiosity, and \nperseverance, can manage a few wizard \nspells, perhaps by persuading a lonely mage \nto reveal his secrets. \nRegardless of their source, all spells fall \ninto the general categories of wizard or \npriest. Although some spells appear in both \ncategories, in general the categories differ in \nhow spells are acquired, stored, and cast. \nWizard Spells \nWizard spells range \nfrom spells of simple utility to great and \npowerful magics. The wizard spell group \nhas no single theme or purpose. The vast \nmajority of wizard spells were created by \nancient mages for many different purposes. \nSome are to serve the common man in his \neveryday needs. Others provide adventur- \ners with the might and firepower they need \nto survive. Some are relatively simple and \nsafe to use (as safe as magic can be); others \nare complicated, filled with hazards and \nsnares for the rash and unwary. Perhaps the \ngreatest of all wizard spells is the powerful \nand tricky wish. It represents the epitome of \nspell-casting-causing things to happen \nsimply because the mage desires it to be so. \nBut it is a long and difficult task to attain the \nmastery needed to learn this spell. \nAlthough some characters can use spells, \nthe workings of magic are dimly understood \nat best. There are many theories about \nwhere the power comes from. The most \ncommonly accepted idea is that the mysteri- \nous combination of words, gestures, and \nmaterials that make up a spell somehow \ntaps an extradimensional source of energy \nthat in turn causes the desired effect. Some- \nhow the components of the spells-those \nwords, gestures and materials-route this \nenergy to a specific and desired result. For- \ntunately, how this happens is not very \nimportant to the majority of wizards. It is \nenough to know that \"when you do this, \nthat happens .\" \nCasting a wizard spell is a very compli- \ncated ordeal. The process of learning the \ncorrect procedure to cast a spell is difficult \nand taxing to the mind. Thus a wizard must \ncheck to see if he learns each new spell \n(according to his Intelligence-see Table 4). \nFurthermore, there is a limit to just how \nmuch of this strangeness-illogical mathe- \nmatics, alchemical chemistry, structuralist \nlinguistics-a wizards mind can compre-"
