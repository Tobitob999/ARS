    "text": "of conduct that governed their party, each \nmember would look for ways to twist the \nrules to his own favor. A group of players \nwho play a harmonious party of evil char- \nacters simply are not playing their align- \nments correctly. By its nature, evil \naligmmnts call for disharmony and squab- \nbling, which destroys the fun. \nImagine how groups of different align- \nments might seek to divide a treasure trove. \nSuppose the hdventuring party contains one \ncharacter of each alignment (a virtually \nimpossible situation, but useful for illustra- \ntion). Each is then allowed to present his \nargment: \nThe lawful good character says, \"Before \nwe went on this adventure, we agreed to \nsplit the treasure equally, and that's what \nwe're going to do. First, we'll deduct the \ncosts of the adventure and pay for the resur- \nrection of those who have fallen, since we're \nsharing all this equally. If someone can't be \nraised, then his share goes to his family.\" \n\"Since we agreed to split equally, that's \nfine,\" replies the lawful evil character \nthoughdully. \"But there was nothing in this \ndeal about paying for anyone else's expens- \nes. It's not my fault if you spent a lot on \n[ I \nequipment1 Furthermore, this deal applies \nonly to the surviving partners; I don't \nremember anything about dead partners. \nI'm not setting aside any money to raise that \nklutz. He's someone else's problem.\" \nFlourkhhg a sheet of paper, the lawful \nneutral character breaks in. \"It's a good \nthing for you two that I've got things to&- \ner, nice and organid. I had the foresight to \nwrite down the exact terms of our agree- \nment, and we're all going to follow them.\" \nThe neutral good character balances the \nissues and decides, \"I'm in favor of equal \nthat expemes are each adventurer's own \nbusiness: If someone spent too much, then \nhe should be more careful next time. But \nraising fallen comrades seems like a good \nidea, so I say we set aside money to do that.\" \nAfter listening to the above arguments, \nthe true neutral character decides not to say \nanything yet. He's not particularly con- \ncerned with any choice. If the issue can be \nsolved without his becoming involved, \ngreat. But if it looks like one person is going \nto get everything, that's when he'll step in \nand cast his vote for a more balanced distri- \nbution. \nsh-that keeps everybody happy. I kel \nThe neutral evil character died during the \nadventure, so he doerrn't have mything to \nsay. However, if he could make his opinion \nknown, he would gladly argue that the \ngroup ought to pay for raising him and set \naside a share for him. Thcneutdevil ckr \nacter would also hope that the group doesn't \ndiscover the big gem he dy pocketed \nduring one of the encoun~. \nThe chaotic gd character objects to the \nwhole business. \"Look, it's obvious thmt the \noriginal agreement is messed up. I say we \nscrap it and reward people for what they \nground when the rest of us were doing all \nthe real fighting. I don't see why anyofie \nshould be rewarded for being a codi As \nfar as raising dead partners, I say that's a \nmatter of personal choice. I dodt mind \nchipping in for some of them, but I don't \nthink I want everyone back in the group.\" \nOutraged at the totally true but tpctleas \naccusation of cowardice, the chaotic evil \ncharacter snaps back, \"Look, I was doing an \nimportant job, guprQirg the rearl Can I help \nit if nothing tried to sneak upbehind us? \nNow, it seems to me thpt allof you are \npretty beat up-and I'm not. So, I don't \nthink there's going to be too much objection \nif I take all the jewelry and that wand. c\\ml \nI'll take anything interesting those two dead \nguys have. Now, you can either work with \nme and do what I say or get lost-pw \nmanentlyl\" \nThe chaotic neutral character is dso &ad \n(after he tried to charge a gorgon), so he \ndoesn't contribute to the argument. How- \never, if he were alive, he would join forces \nwithwhichever si& appealed to him the \nmost at the moment. If he couldn't decide, \nhe'd fIip a coin. \nClearly, widely diveme ;Ilisnmurts C a \ngroup can make even the simplest task \nimpossible. It is almost certain that the \ngroup in the example would come to blows \nbefore they could reach a decision. &t \ndividing cash is not the only instance in \nwhich this group would have probkms. \nConsider the battle in which they gained the \ntreasure in the first place. \nUpon penetrating theheart ofthe ruined \ncastle, the party met its foe, a powerful gor- \ngon commanded by a mad wamior.
