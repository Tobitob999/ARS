When the number of Con- \nstitution points lost equals the caster’s origi- \nnal Constitution ability score, the caster \ndies and becomes a shade. \nForesight (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2d4 rounds + 1 roundllevel \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell grants the caster a powerful \nsixth sense in relation to himself or another. \nAlthough cast upon himself, the wizard can \nspecify that he or another is the beneficiary \nof the spell. Once the spell is cast, the wizard \nreceives instantaneous warnings of impend- \ning danger or harm to the object of the spell. \nThus, if he were the object of the spell, the \nwizard would be warned in advance if a \nthief were about to attempt to backstab \nhim, or if a creature were about to leap out \nfrom an unexpected direction, or if an \nattacker were specifically targeting him \nwith a spell or missile weapon. When the \nwarnings are about him personally, the wiz- \nard cannot be surprised and always knows \nthe direction from which any attack on him \nis made. In addition, the spell gives the wiz- \nard a general idea of what action he might \ntake to best protect himself- duck, jump \nright, close his eyes, etc.-and gives him a \ndefensive bonus of 2 to his Armor Class. \nWhen another is the object of the spell, the \nwizard receives warnings about that person. \nHe must still communicate this to the other \nto negate any surprise. Shouting a warning, \nyanking the person back, even telepathical- \nly communicating through a crystal ball can \nall be accomplished before the trap is \nsprung-if the wizard does not hesitate. The \nobject of the spell does not gain the defen- \nsive bonus to his Armor Class, however. \nThe material component for this spell is a \nhummingbirds feather. \nGate (ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe casting of a gate spell has two effects. \nFirst, it causes an interdimensional connec- \ntion between the plane of existence the wiz- \nard is in and the plane in which dwells a \nspecific being of great power, enabling the \nbeing to merely step through the gate, or \nportal, from its plane to that of the caster. \nSecond, the utterance of the spell attracts \nthe attention of the sought-after dweller in \nthe other plane. When casting the spell, the \n195 \nwizard must name the entity he desires to \nuse the gate and to come to the wizards aid. \nThere is a 100% certainty that something \nsteps through the gate. Unless the DM has \nsome facts prepared regarding the minions \nserving the being called forth by the gate \nspell, the being itself comes. \nIf the matter is trifling, the being might \nleave, inflict an appropriate penalty on the \nwizard, or attack the wizard; if the matter is \nof middling importance, the being can take \nsome positive action to set matters aright, \nthen demand appropriate repayment; and if \nthe matter is urgent, it can act accordingly \nand ask whatever is its wont thereafter, if \nappropriate. The actions of the being that \ncomes through depend on many factors, \nincluding the alignments of the wizard and \nthe deity, the nature of his companions, and \nwho or what opposes or threatens the wiz- \nard. Such beings generally avoid direct con- \nflict with their equals or betters. The being \ngated in will either return immediately (very \nunlikely) or remain to take action. Casting \nthis spell ages the wizard five years. \nImprisonment (Abjuration) \nRevemible \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen an imprisonment spell is cast and \nthe victim is touched, the recipient is \nentombed in a state of suspended animation \n(see the temporal stusis spell) in a small \nsphere far beneath the surface of the earth. \nThe victim remains there unless a reverse of \nthe spell, with the creature‘s name and back- \nground, is cast. Magical search by crystal \nball, a locate object spell, or similar means \nwill not reveal the fact that a creature is \nimprisoned. The imprisonment spell func- \ntions only if the subject creature’s name and \nbackground are known. \nThe reverse spell, freedom, cast upon the \nspot at which a creature was entombed and \nsunk into the earth, causes it to reappear at \nthat spot. If the caster does not perfectly \nintone the name and background of the \ncreature to be freed, there is a 10% chance \nthat 1 to 100 creatures will be freed from \nimprisonment at the same time. \nNote: The exact details of any creatures \nfreed are up to the DM. A random method \nof determining this is to roll percentile dice \ntwice (once for imprisoned creature density \nand once for a base number of creatures at \nmaximum density). The rolls are multiplied \nand rounded to the nearest whole number. \nEach released creature has a 10% chance to \nbe in the area of the spellcaster. If monsters \nare being generated randomly, roll Id20 for \nlevel, with rolls of 9 + considered 9, and the \nexact monsters determined by the random \nencounter tables. \nFor example, if the \nand 60, the number of \n.22 X .60 = .1320 = \nonly 10% of these will \nvicinity of the caster, \nencounter only one or two \nMeteor Swum (Evocation) \nRange: 40 yards + 10 yards/le \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/~ \nfrom the outstretched hand of \nthat there are overlapping areas of effect, \nthe outer sides 20 feet long.
