    "text": "This section is intended for novice role- \nplayers. If you have played role-playing \ngames before, don't be surprised if what you \nread here sounds familiar. \nGames come in a wide assortment of \ntypes: board games, card games, word \ngames, picture games, miniatures games. \nEven within these categories are subcatego- \nries. Board games, for example, can be \ndivided into path games, real estate games, \nmilitary simulation games, abstract strategy \ngames, mystery games, and a host of others. \nStill, in all this mass of games, role- \nplaying games are unique. They form a cat- \negory all their own that doesn't overlap any \nother category. \nFor that reason, role-playing games are \nhard to describe. Comparisons don't work \nbecause there isn't anything similar to com- \npare them to. At least, not without stretch- \ning your imagination well beyond its \nnormal, everyday extension. \nBut then, stretching your imagination is \nwhat role-playing is all about. So let's try an \nanalogy. \nImagine that you are playing a simple \nboard game, called Snakes and Ladders. \nYour goal is to get from the bottom to the \ntop of the board before all the other players. \nAlong the way are traps that can send you \nsliding back toward your starting position. \nThere are also ladders that can let you jump \nahead, closer to the finish space. So far, it's \npretty simple and pretty standard. \nNow let's change a few things. Instead of \na flat, featureless board with a path winding \nfrom side to side, let's have a maze. You are \nstanding at the entrance, and you know that \nthere's an exit somewhere, but you don't \nknow where. You have to find it. \nInstead of snakes and ladders, we'll put in \nhidden doors and secret passages. Don't roll \na die to see how far you move; you can \nmove as far as you want. Move down the \ncorridor to the intersection. You can turn \nright, or left, or go straight ahead, or go \nback the way you came. Or, as long as \nyou're here, you can look for a hidden door. \nIf you find one, it will open into another \nstretch of corridor. That corridor might take \nyou straight to the exit or lead you into a \nblind alley. The only way to find out is to \nstep in and start walking. \nOf course, given enough time, eventually \nyou'll find the exit. To keep the game inter- \nesting, let's put some other things in the \nmaze with you. Nasty things. Things like \nvampire bats and hobgoblins and zombies \nand ogres. Of course, we'll give you a sword \nand a shield, so if you meet one of these \nthings you can defend yourself. You do \nknow how to use a sword, don't you? \nAnd there are other players in the maze as \nwell. They have swords and shields, too. \nHow do you suppose another player would \nreact if you chance to meet? He might \nAfter all, even an ogre might think twice \nabout attacking two people carrying sharp \nswords and stout shields. \nFinally, let's put the board somewhere \nyou can't see it. Let's give it to one of the \nplayers and make that player the referee. \nInstead of looking at the board, you listen to \nthe referee as he describes what you can see \nfrom your position on the board. You tell \nthe referee what you want to do and he \nmoves your piece accordingly. As the ref- \neree describes your surroundings, try to pic- \nture them mentally. Close your eyes and \nconstruct the walls of the maze around \nyourself. Imagine the hobgoblin as the ref- \neree describes it whooping and gamboling \ndown the corridor toward you. Now imag- \nine how you would react in that situation \nand tell the referee what you are going to do \nabout it. \nWe have just constructed a simple role- \nplaying game. It is not a sophisticated game, \nbut it has the essential element that makes a \nrole-playing game: The player is placed in \nthe midst of an unknown or dangerous situ- \nation created by a referee and must work his \nway through it. \nThis is the heart of role-playing. The \nplayer adopts the role of a character and \nthen guides that character through an \nadventure. The player makes decisions, \ninteracts with other characters and players, \nand, essentially, \"pretends\" to be his charac- \nter during the course of the game. That \ndoesn't mean that the player must jump up \nand down, dash around, and act like his \ncharacter. It means that whenever the char- \nacter is called on to do something or make a \ndecision, the player pretends that he is in \nthat situation and chooses an appropriate \ncourse of action. \nPhysically, the players and referee (the \nDM) should be seated comfortably around a \ntable with the referee at the head. Players \nneed plenty of room for papers, pencils, \ndice, rule books, drinks, and snacks. The \nreferee needs extra space for his maps, dice, \nrule books, and assorted notes. \nThe Goal \nAnother major dif- \nference between role-playing games and \nother games is the ultimate goal. Everyone \nassumes that a game must have a beginning \nand an end and that the end comes when \nsomeone wins. That doesn't apply to role- \nplaying because no one \"wins\" in a role- \nplaying game. The point of playing is not to \nwin but to have fun and to socialize. \nAn adventure usually has a goal of some \nsort: protect the villagers from the mon- \nsters; rescue the lost princes; explore the \nandent ruins. Typically, this goal can be \nattained in a reasonable playing time: four \nto eight hours is standard. This might \nrequire the players to get together for one, \n9 \ntwo, or even three playing sessions to reach \ntheir goal and complete the adventure. \nBut the game doesn't end when an adven- \nture is finished. The same characters can go \non to new adventures. Such a des of \nadventures is called a campaign. \nRemember, the point of an adventure is \nnot to win but to have fun while working \ntoward a common goal. But the hngth of \nany particular adventure need not impose \nan artificial limit on the length of the game. \nThe AD&W game embraces more than \nenough adventure to keep a group of char- \nacters occupied for years. \nRequired Materials \nAside from a copy \nof this book, very little is needed to play the \nAD&D game. \nYou will need some sort of Character \nrecord. TSR publishes character record \nsheets that are quite handy and easy to we, \nbut any sheet of paper will do. Blank pap, \nlined paper, or even graph paper can be \nused. A double-sized sheet of paper (11 x 17 \ninches), folded in half, is excellent. Keep \nyour character record in pencil, because it \nwill change frequently during the game. A \ngood eraser is also a must. \nA full set of polyhedral dice is necessary. \nA full set consists of 4-, 6, &I 10-, 12-, and \n20-sided dice. A few extra 6- and 1O-sided \ndice are a good idea. Polyhedral dice should \nbe available wherever you got this book. \nThroughout these rules, the various dice \nare referred to by a code that is in the fonn: \nI of dice, followed by \"d,!' followed by a \nnumeral for the type of dice. In other \nwords, if you are to roll one hided die, you \nwould see \"roll ld6!' Five lz-sided dice are \nreferred to as \"SdlZ!' (If you don't have five \n12aided dice, just roll one five times and \nadd the results.) \nWhen the rules say to roll \"percentile \ndice\" or \"Idloo: you need to generate a \nrandom number from 1 to 100. One way to \ndo this is to roll two loaided dice of diffelc \nent color& Before you roll, designate one \ndie as the tens place and the other as the \nones place. Rolling them together enables \nyou to generate a number from I to 100 (a \nresult of \"0\" on both dice is read as \"00\" or \n\"100\"). For example, if the blue die (repre- \nsenting the tens place) rolls an \"8\" and the \nred die (ones place) rolls a \"5:' the result is \n85. Another, more expensive, way to gener- \nate a number from 1 to 100 is to buy one of \nthe dice that actually have numbers from 1 \nto 100 on them. \nattack, but he also might offer to team up. \nI \nAt least one player should have a few \nsheets of graph paper for mapping the \ngroup's progress. Assorted pieces of scratch \npaper are handy for making quick notes, for \npassing secret messages to other players or \nthe DM, or for keeping track of odd bits of \ninformation that you don't want cluttering"
