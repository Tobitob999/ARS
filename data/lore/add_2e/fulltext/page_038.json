Each ani- \nmal form (reptile, bird, or mammal) can be \nused only once per day. The size can vary \nfrom that of a bullfrog or small bird to as \nlarge as a black bear. Upon assuming a new \nform the druid heals 10 to 60 percent (ld6 x \nall damage he has suffered (round \ndown). The druid can only assume \nof a normal (real world) animal in \nits normal proportions, but by doing so he \ntakes on all of that creature's char- \nacteristics-its movement rate and abilities, \nits Armor Class, number of attacks, and \ndamage per attack. I \nThus, a druid could change into a wren to \nfly across a river, transform into a black \nbear on the opposite side and attack the orcs \ngathered there, and finally change into a \nsnake to escape into the bushes before more \norcs arrive. \nThe druid's clothing and one item held in \neach hand also become part of the new \nbody; these reappear when the druid \nresumes his normal shape. The items cannot \nbe used while the druid is in animal form. \n, \n'A druid cannot turn undead. \nEthos \nAs protectors of nature, druids are aloof \nfrom the complications of the temporal \nworld. Their greatest concern is for the con- \ntinuation of the orderly and proper cycles of \nnature-birth, growth, death, and rebirth. \nDruids tend to view all things as cyclic and \nthus the battles of good and evil are only the \nrising and falling tides of time. Only when \nthe cycle and balance are disrupted does the \ndruid become concerned. Given this view of \nthings, the druid must be neutral in align- \nment. \nDruids are charged with protecting \nwildemess-in particular trees, wild plants, \nwild animals, and crops. By association, \nthey are also responsible for their followers \nand their animals. Druids recognize that all \ncreatures (including humans) need food, \nshelter, and protection from harm. Hunt- \ning, farming, and cutting lumber for homes \nare logical and neceSSary parts of the natu- \nral cycle. However, druids do not tolerate \nunnecessary destruction or exploitation of \nnature for profit. Druids often prefer subtle \nand devious methods of revenge against \nthose who defile nature. It is well known \nthat druids are both very unforgiving and \nvery patient. \nMistletoe is an important holy symbol to \ndruids and it is a necessary part of some \nspells (those requiring a holy symbol). To be \nfully effective, the mistletoe must be gath- \nered by the light of the full moon using a \ngolden or silver sickle specially made for the \n37 \npurpose. Mistletoe gathered by other means \nhalves the effectiveness of a given spell, if it \ncauses damage or has an area of effect, and \ngrants the target a +2 bonus to his saving \nthrow if a saving throw is applicable. \nDruids as a class do not dwell perma- \nnently in castles, cities, or towns. All druids \nprefer to live in sacred groves, where they \nbuild small sod, log, or stone cottages. \nDruid Organization \nDruids have a worldwide structure. At \ntheir upper levels (12th and above), only a \nfew druids can hold each level. \nDruids, Archdruids, and the Great Druid \nAt 12th level, the druid character acquires \nthe official title of \"druid (all druid charac- \nters below 12th level are officially known as \n\"initiates\"). There can be only nine 12th- \nlevel druids in any geographic region (as \ndefined by oceans, seas, and mountain \nranges; a continent may consist of three or \nfour such regions). A character cannot \nreach 12th level unless he takes his place as \none of the nine druids. This is possible only \nif there are currently fewer than nine druids \nin the region, or if the character defeats one \nof the nine druids in magical or hand-to- \nhand combat, thereby assuming the defeat- \ned druid's position. If such combat is not \nmortal, the loser drops experience points so \nthat he has exactly 200,000 remaining-just \nenough to be 11th level. \nThe precise details of each combat are \nworked out between the two combatants in \nadvance. The combat can be magical, non- \nmagical, or a mixture of both. It can be \nfought to the death, until only one character \nis unconscious, until a predetermined num-. \nber of hit points is lost, or even until the first \nblow is landed, although in this case both \nplayers would have to be supremely confi- \ndent of their abilities. Whatever can be \nagreed upon between the characters is legiti- \nmate, so long as there is some element of \nskill and risk. \nWhen a character becomes a 12th-level \ndruid, he gains three underlings. Their level \ndepends on the character's position among \nthe nine druids. The druid with the most \nexperience points is served by three initiates \nof 9th level; the second-most experienced \ndruid is served by three initiates of 8th level; \nand so on, until the least experienced druid \nis served by three 1st-level initiates. \nOnly three archdruids (13th level) can \noperate in a geographical region. To become \nan archdruid, a 12th-level druid must defeat \none of the reigning archdruids or advance \ninto a vacant position. Each of the three \narchdruids is served by three initiates of \nloth level. From among the archdruids of \nthe entire world, three are chosen to serve \nthe Grand Druid (see \"The Grand Druid and \nHierophant Druids\" section). These three \nretain their attendees but are themselves ser- \nhis region. He, too, won \nThe ascendance of a new great druid usu- \nally sets off shock waves of turmoil and &a- \nos through the druidical hierarchy. The \nadvancement of an archdruid creates an \nopening that is fiercely contested by the \ndruids, and the advancement of a druid ma- \nates an opening in their ranks. \nThe Grand Lhuid and Hierophmt Dnrido \nThe highest ranking druid in the world is \nthe Grand hid (15th level). Unlike great \ndruids (several of whom can operate simul- \ntaneously in different lands), only one per- \nson in a world can ever hold this title at one \ntime. Consequently, only one druid can be \n15th level at any time. \nThe Grand Druid knows six spells of e+ \nlevel (instead of the normal spell prop \nsion) and also can cast up to six additha1 \nspell levels, either as a single spell or as se~- \nera1 spells whose levels total to six (c.g., one \n6th-level spell, six 1st-level spells, throe 2nd- \nlevel spells, etc.). \nThe Grand Druid is attended by nine oth- \ner druids who are subject only to him and \nhave nothing to do with the hidy d \nany specific land or area. Any druid charac- \nter of any level can seek the Grand Mid \nand ask to serve him. Three of these nine are \narchdruids who roam the world, acting as \nhis messengers and agents. Each of them \nreceives four additional spell levels. T)le \nremainder are normally druids of 7th to \n11th level, although the Grand Druid can \nrequest a druid of any level to serve him and \noften considers applications from humble \naspirants. \nThe position of Grand Druid is not wan \nthrough combat. Instead, the Grand hid \nselects his successor from the a \n3,000,000 experience points). \nUpon stepping down, the former Grand \nDruid must relinquish the six bonus spell \nlevels and all of his experience points but 1 \n(he keeps the rest of his abilities).
