    "text": "assumes, of course, that the fireball, light- \nning bolt, or whatever, hit the cover-a \nman crouching behind a stone wall would \nbe protected if a fireball exploded in front of \nthe wall, but would not be protected by cov- \ner if the blast occurred behind him, on his \nside of the wall. \nGrenadsUke Mlrdles \nUnlike standard \nmissiles, which target a specific creature, a \ngrenade-like missile is aimed at a point, \nwhether this point is a creature or a spot on \nthe ground. When the attack is announced, \nthe player indicates where he wants the mis- \nsile to land. This then becomes the target \npoint and is used to determine the direction \nand distance of any scatter. \nMost grenade-like missiles are items of \nopportunity or necessity-rocks, flasks of \noil, vials of holy water, or beakers of acid. \nAs such, these items are not listed on the \nequipment tables for range, ROF, and dam- \nage. The range each can be thrown varies \nwith the Strength of the character and the \nweight of the object. \nA missile of five pounds or less can be \nthrown about 30 feet. Short range is 10 feet, \nmedium range is 20 feet, and everything \nbeyond is maximum range. Heavier items \nhave reduced ranges. Just how far an object \ncan be thrown is decided by the DM. \nJ3qceptionally heavy items can be thrown \nonly if the character rolls a successful bend \nbardlift gates check. In no case can a char- \nacter throw an item heavier than his \nStrength would allow him to lift. Thus, the \nDM can rule that a character would have lit- \ntle trouble chucking a half-empty backpack \nacross a ten-foot chasm, but the character \nwould need to make a check in order to \nheave an orc ten feet through the air into the \nfaces of his orcish friends. \nOnce a container hits, it normally breaks \nimmediately. However, this is not always \ntrue. Some missiles, like soft leather flasks \nor hard pottery, are particularly resistant. If \nthere’s some doubt about whetkr or not a \nthrown object will break, the DM can \nrequire an item saving throw (this informa- \ntion is in the DMG) to see if it shatters or \nrips, spewing its contents everywhere. \nThe DMG contains information on how \nto resolve the inevitable situations in which \ngrenade-like missiles miss their tarnets. - \nf Crena -- 1II-c Missiles \nAcid damage is par- \nticularly grim. Aside from the possibility of \nscarring (which is left to the DM), acid dam- \nage cannot be healed by regeneration. It \nmust be healed normally. Thus it is very use- \nful against regenerating creatures such as \ntrolIs. Acid is very rare. \nHoly Water affects most forms of undead \nand creatures from the lower planes. It has \nno effect against a creature in gaseous form \nor undead without material form. \nUnholy water (essentially holy water \nused by evil priests) affects paladins, crea- \ntures whose purpose is to defend good (lam- \nmasu, shedu, etc.), and creatures and beings \nfrom the upper planes. \nHoly (or unholy) water affects creatures \nas does acid, causing damage that cannot be \nregenerated but must be healed normally. \nOil causes damage only when it is lit. This \niormally requires a two-step process-first \nioaking the target in flammable oil and then \nietting it afire. Thus using flaming oil often \n*equires two successful attacks. \nA direct hit from flaming oil burns for \nwo rounds, causing 2d6 points pf damage \nn the first round and ld6 points in the sec- \nmd round. \nPoison is generally not very effective as a \nnissile weapon. Most poisons take effect \n)nly if the missile scores a direct hit, and \nven then only if it drops into the gaping \nnaw of some huge creature. Contact poi- \nons have normal poison effects on a direct \nut. The DM has information about specific \n)oison effects in the \nipeciai De \nSo far, the bulk of this \nhapter has dealt with ways to attack. Now, \ni’s time to turn to defense. There are several \nrays to avoid taking damage. Two of the \nlost common are the saving throw and \nwgic resistance. Somewhat less common, \necause its use is limited to clerics and pala- \nins, is the ability to tum undead. \nDuring a one \nminute combat round, each characte \nassumed to block ma \nattacks and \nblocked. In \nparry all the \ngle out each parry. \nWhen a character deliberately chooser \nnot to parry (a mage casting a spell, fox \ninstance), his chance of being hi! \nincreases. Thus, choosing to parry, in \nand of itself, is not a separate optio \nAD&W game rules. \nsame time, the assumption \ncters in combat are constant \nthemselves to some risk- \ntrying to get a clear view of a target or I \nlooking for the opening to make an \nattack. There are times, however, when \nthis is not the case. Sometimes, the only \nthing a character wants to do is avoid \nbeing hit. \na parry-ror \nfor the round-he can’t attack, move, ( \ncast spells. This frees the character to \nconcentrate solely on defense. At this \npoint, all characters but warriors gain an \nAC bonus equal to half their level. A 6th- \nlevel wizard would have a +3 bonus to \nhis AC (lowering his AC by 3). A war- \nrior gets a bonus eaual to half his level \none. A 6th-level fight gain \note that the benefit IS rfect \nall-around defense, and it‘s not efiective \nagainst rear or missile attacks. It applies \nonly to those characters attacking the \ndefender with frontal melee attacks. This \noptional defense has no effect against \nmagical attacks, so it wouldn‘t do any- \nthing to protect a character from the \nforce of a lightning bolt or fireball, fa \nexample \nThe Savkg TIbrovL \n?he sauing throw is \na die roll that gives a chance, however slim, \nthat the character or creature finds some \nway to save himself from certain destruc- \ntion (or at least lessen the damage of a suc- \ncessful attack). \nMore often than not, the saving throw \nrepresents an instinctive act on the part of \nthe character-diving to the ground just as a \nfireball scorches the group, blanking the \nmind just as a mental battle begins; blocking \nthe worst of an acid spray with a shield. The \nexact action is not important-DMs and \nplayers can think of lively and colorful \nexplanations of why a saving throw suc- \nceeded or failed. Explanations tailored to \nthe events of the moment enhance the \nexcitement of the game. \nRolling Saving Tkowr \nTo make a saving \nthrow, a player rolls a 2kided die (ld20). \nThe result must be equal to or greater than \nthe character’s saving throw number. The \nlumber a character needs to roll varies \niepending upon the character‘s group, his \nevel, and what the character is trying to \nsave himself from. A character’s saving \nthrow numbers can be found in Table 60. \nSaving throws are made in a variety of \nsituations: For attacks involving paralyza- \ntion, poison, or death magic; petrification \nor polymorph; rod, staff, or wand; breath \nweapon; and spells. The type of saving \nthrow a character must roll is determined by \nthe specific spell, monster, magical item, or \nsituation involved. \nMonsters also use Table 60. The DM has \nspecific information about monster saving \n.brows. \ni"
