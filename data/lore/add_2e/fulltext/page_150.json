Thus any wounding or \nmistreatment of the body is not felt and no \nreaction occurs; damage is only 1/z normal. \nIn addition, paralysis, poison, or energy- \nlevel drain cannot affect an individual under \nthe influence of this spell. Poison injected or \notherwise introduced into the body takes \neffect when the spell recipient is no longer \nunder the influence of this spell, although a \nsaving throw is permitted. \nNote that only a willing individual can be \naffected by feign death. The spellcaster can \nend the spell effects at any time desired, as \nwill a successful dispeI, but a full round is \nrequired for bodily functions to begin again. \nFireball (Evocation) \nRange: 10 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 2Sfoot radius \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nA fireball is an explosive burst of flame, \nwhich detonates with a low roar and deliv- \ners damage proportional to the level of the \nwizard who cast it-ld6 points of damage \nfor each level of experience of the spellcaster \n(up to a maximum of 1Od6). The burst of the \nfireball creates little pressure and generally \nconforms to the shape of the area in which it \noccurs. The fireball fills an area equal to its \nnormal spherical volume (roughly 33,000 \ncubic feet-thirty-three 10' x 10' x 10' \ncubes). Besides causing damage to crea- \ntures, the fireball ignites all combustible \nmaterials within its burst radius, and the \nheat of the fireball melts soft metals such as \ngold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items \nrequire saving throws vs. magical fire to \ndetermine if they are affected, but items in \nthe possession of a creature that rolls a suc- \ncessful saving throw are unaffected by the \nfireball. \nThe wizard points his finger and speaks \nthe range (distance and height) at which the \nfireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the \npointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a \nmaterial body or solid barrier prior to \nattaining the prescribed range, blossoms \ninto the fireball (an early impact results in \nan early detonation). Creatures failing their \nsaving throws each suffer full damage from \nthe blast. Those who roll successful saving \nthrows manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll \naside, each receiving half damage (the DM \nrolls the damage and each affected creature \nsuffers either full damage or half damage \n[round fractions down], depending on \nwhether the creature saved or not). \nThe material component of this spell is a \ntiny ball of bat guano and sulphur. \nFlame Arrow (ConjuratiodSumrnoning) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yarddlevel \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell has two effects. First, the wiz- \nard can cause normal arrows or crossbow \nbolts to become magical flaming missiles for \none round. The missiles must be nocked and \ndrawn (or cocked) at the completion of the \nspell. If they are not loosed within one \nround, they are consumed by the magic. For \nevery five levels the caster has achieved, up \nto 10 arrows or bolts can be affected. The \narrows inflict normal damage, plus 1 point \nof fire damage to any target struck. They \nmay also cause incendiary damage. This \nversion of the spell is used most often in \nlarge battles. \nThe second version of this spell enables \nthe caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents \nwithin range. Each bolt inflicts ld6 points of \npier- damage, plus 4d6 points of fire \ndamage. Only half of the fire damage is \ninflicted if the creature struck saves vs. \nspell. The caster receives one bolt for every \nfive experience levels (two bolts at 10th \nlevel, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be \nused on creatures within 20 yards of each \nother and in front of the wizard. \nThe material components for this spell are \na drop of oil and a small piece of flint. \nFly (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level + ld6 turns \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to bestow \nthe power of magical flight. The creature \naffected is able to move vertically and hor- \nizontally at a rate of 18 (half that if ascend- \ning, twice that if descending in a dive). The \nmaneuverability class of the creature is B. \nUsing the fly spell requires as much concen- \ntration as walking, so most spells can be cast \n1 49 \nwhile hovering or moving slowly (move- \nment of 3). Possible combat penalties while \nflying are known to the DM (in the \"Aerial \nCombat\" section of the DMG). The exact \nduration of the spell is always unknown to \nthe spellcaster, as the variable addition 4 \ndetermined secretly by the DM. \nThe material component of the fly spell is \na wing feather \nGust of Wind (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot wide path, 10 \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, a strong puff of air \noriginates from the wizard and moves in the \ndirection he is facing. The force of this gust \nof wind (about 30 m.p.h) is sufficient to \nextinguish candles, torches, and similar \nunprotected flames. It cauees protected \nflames-such as those of lantern-to dance \nwildly and has a 5% chance per level a) \nexperience of the spellcaster to extinguish \neven such lights. It also fans large fires out- \nward ld6 feet in the direction of the winds \nmovement. It form back small flying ara- \ntures ld6 x 10 yards and causes man-sbd \nbeings to be held motionless if attempting to \nmove against its force. It slows larger-than- \nman-sized flying creatures by 50% for one \nround. It blows over light objects, disperses \nmost vapors, and forces away gaseous or \nunsecured levitating creatures. Its path is 10 \nfeet wide by 10 yards long per level of expe- \nrience of the caster (e.g., an 8th-level wizard \ncauses a gust of wind that travels 80 yards). \nThe material component of the spell is a \nlegume seed. \nyarddlevel long \nHaste (Alteration) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature/level \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen this spell is cast, each affected crea- \nture functions at double its normal move- \nment and attack rates. A hasted creature \ngains a -2 initiative bonus. Thus, a crea- \nture moving at 6 and attacking once per \nround would move at 12 and attack twice \nper round. Spellcasting and spell effects are \nnot sped up. The number of creatures that \ncan be affected is equal to the caster's experi- \nence level; those creatures closest to the ten- \nter of effect are affected first. All affected by \nhaste must be in the designated area of \neffect. Note that this spell negates the effects \nDf a slow spell. Additionally, this spell ages"
