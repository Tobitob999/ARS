The dead tend to give extremely \nbrief and limited answers, often cryptic, and \nto take questions literally. Furthermore, \ntheir knowledge is often limited to what \nthey knew in life. \nA dead creature of different alignment or \nSphere: Divination \nRange: 1 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSa* Throw: Swcial Y \nUpon casting a speak with deud spell, the \npriest is able to ask several questions of a \ndead creature in a set period of time and \nreceive answers according to the knowledge \nof that creature. Of course, the priest must \nbe able to converse in the language that the \ndeud creature once used. The length of time \nthe creature bas been dead is a factor, since \nonly higher level priests can converse with a \nlong-ckad creature. The number of ques- \ntions that can be answered and the length of \ntime in which the questions can be asked \nof higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's \nlevel receives a saving throw vs. spell. A \ndead creature that successfully saves can \nrefuse to answer questions, ending the spell. \nAt the DMs option, the casting of this spell \non a given creature might be restricted to \nonce per week. \nThe priest needs a holy symbol and burn- \ning incense in order to cast this spell upon \nthe body, remains, or a portion thereof. The \nremains are not expended. This spell does \nnot function under water. \nNumber \nof Time Dead Questioned Questions \nCaster's Level Maximum Length of \nI \n1 week 2 \nof Experience \nup to 7th \n21st and up 1,oOO years 1 hour 7 \nSpike Growth (Alteration, Enchantment) \nRange: 60 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3d4 turns + l/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot squardlevel \nSaving Throw: None \nWherever any type of plant growth of \nmoderate size or density is found, this spell \ncan be used. The ground-covering vegeta- \ntion or roots and rootlets in the area \nbecomes very hard and sharply pointed. In \neffect the ground cover, while appearing to \nbe unchanged, acts as if the area were \nstrewn with caltrops. In areas of bare \nground or earthen pits, roots and rootlets \nact in the same way. For each 10 feet of \nmovement through the area, the victim suf- \nfers 2d4 points of damage. He must also roll \na saving throw vs. spelI. If this saving throw \nis failed, the victim's movement rate is \nreduced by 1/3 from its current total (but a \ncreature's movement rate can never be less \nthan 1). This penalty lastsfor 24 hours, after \nwhich the character's normal movement \nrate is regained. \nWithout the use of a spell such as true see- \ning, similar magical aids, or some other spe- 1 \ncia1 means of detection (such as detect traps \nor detect snares and pits), an area affected \nby spike growth is absolutely undetectable \nsphere: Plant \nas such until a victim enters the area and suf- \nfers damage. Even then, the creature cannot \ndetermine the extent of the perilous area \nunless some means of magical detection is \nUsed. \nThe components for this spell are the \npriest's holy symbol and either seven sharp \nthorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened \nto a point. \nStarshine (Evocation, Inusion/Phantasm) \nSphere: Sun \nRange: 10 yd/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turnllevel \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot squareiievei \nSaving Throw: None \nA starshine spell enables the caster to \nsoftly illuminate an area as if it were \nexposed to a clear night sky filled with stars. \nRegardless of the height of the open area in \nwhich the spell is cast, the area immediately \nbeneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges \nare the same as those for a bright moonlit \nnight-movement noted out' to 100 yards; \nstationary creatures seen up to 50 yards; \ngeneral identifications made at 30 yards; \nrecognition at 10 yards. The spell creates \nshadows and has no effect on infravision. \nThe area of effect actually appears to be a \nnight sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely \n2 14 \nenables the disbeliever to note that the \n\"stars\" are actually evoked lights. This spell \ndoes not function under water. \nThe material components are several \nstalks from an amaryllis plant (especially \nHypoxis) and several holly berries. \nStone Shape (Alteration) \nSphere: Elemental (Earth) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 3' cube plus 1' cube/level \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the caster can form \nan existing piece of stone into any shape that \nsuits his purposes. For example, a stone \nweapon can be made, a special trapdoor \nfashioned, or a crude idol sculpted. By the \nsame token, it enables the spellcaster to \nreshape a stone door, perhaps so as to \nescape imprisonment, providing the volume \nof stone involved was within the limits d \nthe area of effect. While stone coffers can be \nthus formed, stone doors made, etc., the \nfineness of detail is not great. If the shaping \nhas moving parts, there is a 30% chance \nthey do not work. \nThe material component of this spell is \nsoft clay that must be worked into roughly \nthe desired shape of the stone object, and \nthen touched to the stone when the spell is \nuttered. \nSummon Insects \n(ConjuratiodSummoning) \nSphere: Animal \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nThe summon insects spell attracts a cloud \nor swarm of normal insects to attack the \nfoes of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% \nof the time, while crawling insects appear \n30% of the time. The exact insects called are \nbees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying \ninsects are indicated; biting ants or pinching \nbeetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A \ncloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the \ncrawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. \nThis gathers at a point chosen by the caster, \nwithin the spell's range, and attacks any sin- \ngle creature the caster points to. \nThe attacked creature sustains 2 points of \ndamage if it does nothing but attempt to flee \nor fend off the insects during the time it is \nattacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per \nround otherwise. If the insects are ignored, \nthe victim fights with a -2 penalty to his \nattack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor"
