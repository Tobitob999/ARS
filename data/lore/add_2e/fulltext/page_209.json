The range of a warp wood spell is \n10 yards for each level of experience of the \ncaster. It affects approximately a 15-inch \nshaft of wood of up to one-inch diameter \nper level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a \ncaster might be able to warp an hand axe \nhandle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, \nhe could warp the shaft of a typical spear. \nNote that boards or planks can also be af- \nfected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat \nor ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are \nuseless; warped melee weapons suffer a - 4 \npenalty to their attack rolls. \nEnchanted wood is affected only if the \nspellcaster is of higher level than the caster \nof the prior enchantment. The spellcaster \nhas a 20% cumulative chance of success per \nlevel of difference (20% if one level higher, \n40% if two levels higher. etc.). Thus, a door \nmagically held or wizard locked by a 5th- \nlevel wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a \nwarp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. \nWooden magical items are considered en- \nchanted at 12th level (or better). Extremely \npowerful items, such as artifacts, are unaf- \nfected by this spell. \nThe reversed spell, straighten wood, \nstraightens bent or crooked wood, or re- \nverses the effects of a warp wood spell, sub- \nject to the same restrictions. \nWlthdraw (Alteration) \nSphere: Protection \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \ners is permitted.) Note that while affected \nby the withdraw spell, the caster can use \nonly the following spells: any divination \nspell or any curing or healing spell, the latter \non himself only. The casting of any of these \nspells in a different fashion (e.g., a cure light \nwounds spell bestowed upon a companion) \nnegates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the \nwithdrawn caster cannot walk or run, be- \ncome invisible, or engage in actions other \nthan thinking, reading, and the like. He can \nbe affected by the actions of others, losing \nany Dexterity or shield bonus. Any success- \nful attack upon the caster breaks the spell. \nWyvern Watch (Evocation) \nSphere: Guardian \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 8 hours or until strike \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: Neg. ' \nThis spell is known as wyvern watch be- \ncause of the insubstantial haze brought \nforth by its casting, which vaguely resem- \nbles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard \nsome area against intrusion. Any creature \napproaching within 10 feet of the guarded \narea may be affected by the \"wyvern.\" Any \ncreature entering the guarded area must roll \na successful saving throw vs. spell or stand \nparalyzed for one round per level of the \ncaster, until freed by the spellcaster, by a \ndispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis \nspell. A successful saving throw indicates \nthat the subject creature was missed by the \nattack of the wyvern-form, and the spell re- \nmains in place. As soon as a subject creature \nis successfully struck by the wyvern-form, \nthe paralysis takes effect and the force of the \nspell dissipates. The spell force likewise dis- \nsipates if no intruder is struck by the \nwyvern-form for eight hours after the spell \nis cast. Any creature approaching the space \nbeing guarded by the wyvern-form may be \nable to detect its presence before coming \nclose enough to be attacked; this chance of \ndetection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twi- \nlight conditions, and 0% in darkness. \nThe material component is the priest's \nholy symbol. \nBy means of a withdraw spell, the priest \nin effect alters the flow of time with regard \nto himself. While but one round of time \npasses for those not affected by the spell, the \npriest is able to spend two rounds, plus one \nround per level, in contemplation. Thus, a \n5th-level priest can withdraw for seven \nrounds to cogitate on some matter while one \nround passes for all others. (The DM should \nallow the player one minute of real time per \nround withdrawn to ponder some problem \nor question. No discussion with other play- \n208 \nThird-Level Spells \nAnimate Dead (Necromancy) \nSphere: Necromantic \nRange: 10 yards \nComponqnts: V, S, M \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 1 round \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates the lowest of the undead \nmonsters, skeletons or zombies, usually \nfrom the bones or bodies of dead humans, \ndemihumans, or humanoids. The spell \ncauses these remains to become animated \nand obey the simple verbal commands of \nthe caster, regardless of how they communi- \ncated in life. The skeletons or zombies can \nfollow the caster, remain in an area and at- \ntack any creature (or just a specific type of \ncreature) entering the place, etc. The un- \ndead remain animated until they are de- \nstroyed in combat or are turned; the magic \ncannot be dispelled. \nThe priest can animate one skeleton or \none zombie for each experience level he has \nattained. If creatures with more than 1 + Hit \nDice are animated, the number is deter- \nmined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal \nforms have the Hit Dice of the original crea- \nture, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit \nDie. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate \n12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four \nzombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. \nNote that this is based on the standard racial \nHit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer \nwould be animated as a skeleton or zombie \nof 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class \nor racial abilities. The caster can, alterna- \ntively, animate two small animal skeletons \n(1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experi- \nence he has achieved. \nThe spell requires a drop of blood, a pie \nof flesh of the type of creature being a \nmated, and a pinch of bone powder or \nbone shard to complete the spell.
