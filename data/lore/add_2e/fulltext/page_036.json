    "text": "I \ngreat harm and destruction, these spells are \nsometimes bestowed by war or death \npowers. \nSun spells are those dealing in the basic \npowers of the solar universe-the purity of \nlight and its counterpart darkness. Sun \nspells are very common with nature, agri- \ncultural, or life-giving powers. \nWeather spells enable the priest to manip- \nulate the forces of weather. Such manipula- \ntion can be as simple as providing rain to \nparched fields, or as complex as unbridling \nthe power of a raging tempest. Not surpris- \ningly, these tend to be the province of nature \nand agricultural powers and appear in the \nrepertoire of sea and ocean powers. \nAdditional spheres can be created by \nyour DM. The listed spheres are typical of \nthe areas in which deities concentrate their \ninterest and power. Spells outside the deity‘s \nmajor and minor spheres of influence are \nnot available to its priests. \nFurthermore, the priest can obtain his \nspells at a faster or slower pace than the nor- \nmal cleric. Should the character’s ethos \nplace emphasis on self-reliance, the spell \nprogression is slower. Those deities associ- \nated with many amazing and wondrous \nevents might grant more spells per level. Of \ncourse, your DM has final say on this, and \nhe must balance the eain or loss of swlls \nGranted Powers \nAnother aspect of a specific mythos is the \nspecial powers available to its priests. The \ncleric’s granted power is the ability to turn \nundead. This ability, however, is not com- \nmon to all priests. Other deities grant \npowers in accordance with their spheres. If \nyour DM is using a specific mythos, he must \ndecide what power is granted to your priest. \nSome possible suggestions are given below. \n* Incite Berserker Rage, adding a +2 bo- \nnus to attack and damage rolls (War). \nSoothing Word, able to remove fear and \ninfluence hostile reactions (Peace, Mercy, \nHealing). \nCharm or Fascination, which could act \nas a suggestion spell (Love, Beauty, Art). \nInspire Fear, radiating an aura of fear \nsimilar to the fear spell (Death). \nThese are only a few of the granted \npowers that might be available to a charac- \nter. As with allowed weapons, much de- \nds on the culture of the region and the \nand legends surrounding the Power \nEthos \nAll priests must live by certain tenets and \nbeliefs. These guide the priests’ behavior. \nClerics generally try to avoid shedding \nblood and try to aid their community. A \nwar deity may order its priests to be at the \nforefront of battles and to actively crusade \nagainst all enemies. A harvest deity may \nwant its priests to be active in the fields. The \nethos may also dictate what alignment the \npriest must be. The nature of the mythos \nhelps define the strictures the priest must \nfollow. \nPriest Titles \nPriests of differing mythoi often go by ti- \ntles and names other than priest. A priest of \nnature, for example (especially one based on \nWestern European tradition) could be called \na druid (see this page). Shamans and witch \ndoctors are also possibilities. A little library \nresearch will turn up many more unique and \ncolorful titles, a few of which are listed here: \nAbbess, Abbot, Ayatollah, Bonze, \nBrother, Dom, Eye of the Law, Friar, \nGuru, Hajji, Imam, Mendicant, Metro- \npolitan, Mullah, Pardoner, Patriarch, \nPrelate, Prior, Qadi, Rector, Vicar, and \nYogi \nBalancing It AU \nWhen creating a priest of a specific my- \nthos, careful attention must be given to the \nbalance of the character‘s different abilities. \nA priest strong in one area or having a wide \nrange of choice must be appropriately weak- \nened in another area so that he does not be- \ncome too powerful compared to the other \npriests in the game. If a war deity allows a \npriest the use of all weapons and armor, the \ncharacter should be limited in the spells al- \nlowed or powers granted. At the other ex- \ntreme, a character who follows a deity of \npeace should have significant spells and \ngranted powers to make up for his extremely \nlimited or non-existent choice of weapons. A \ndruid, for example, has more granted powers \nthan a normal cleric to compensate for his \nlimited armor and spell selection. \nDruid \nAbility Requirements: Wisdom 12 \nPrime Requisites: Wisdom, Charisma \nRaces Allowed: Human Half4 \nCharisma 15 \ndruids lived among t \nof Western Europe an \nain during the days of the Ro \nEmpire. They acted as advisors to c \ntains and held great influence ove \ntribesmen. Central to their thinking w \nthe belief that the earth was the moth \nand source of all life. They revered many \nnatural things-the sun, moon, and \ntain trees-as deities. Druids in \nAD&D@ game, however, are on \nloosely patterned after these histor \nfigures. They are not required to beh \nlike or follow the beliefs of historic \n. __.._.___I_- \nThe druid is an example d a priest de- \nsigned for a specific mythos. His powers \nand beliefs are different from those of the \ncleric. The druid is a priest of nature and \nguardian of the wilderness, be it forest, \nplains, or jungle. \nRequirements \nA druid must be human or half-elven. He \nmust have a Wisdom score of at least I2 and \na Charisma score of 15 or more. Both of \nthese abilities are prime requisites. \nWeapons Allowed \nUnlike the cleric, the druid is allowed to \nuse only ”natural” armors-leather armor \nand wooden shields, including those with \nmagical enhancements. All other armors are \nforbidden to him. His weapons are limited \nto club, sickle, dart, spear, dagger, scimitar, \nsling, and staff. \nSpells Allowed \nDruids do not have the same range of \nspells as clerics. They have major access to \nthe following spheres: all, animal, elemen- \ntal, healing, plant, and weather. They have \nminor access to the divination sphere. \nDruids can use all magical items normally \nallowed priests, except for those that are \nwritten (books and scrolls) and armor and \nweapons not normally allowed for druids. \nGranted Powers \nA druid makes most saving throws as a \npriest, but he gains a bonus of +2 to all sav- \ning throws vs. fire or electrical attacks. \nAll druids can speak a secret language in \naddition to any other tongues they know. \n(If the optional proficiency rules are used, \nthis language does not use a proficiency \nslot.) The vocabulary of this druidic lan- \nguage is limited to dealing with nature and \nnatwal events. Druids jealously guard this \nlanguage; it is the one infallible method they \nhave of recognizing each another. \nAdditional powers are granted as the \ndruid reaches higher levels: \nHe can identify plants, animals, and \npure water with perfect accuracy after he \nreaches 3rd level. \n* He can pass through overgrown areas \n(thick thorn bushes, tangled vines, briar \npatches, etc.) without leaving a trail and at \nhis normal movement rate after he reaches \n3rd level, \nHe can learn the languages of woodland \ncreatures. These include centaurs, dryads, \nelves, fauns, gnomes, dragons, giants, liz- \nard men, manticores, nixies, pixies, sprites, \nand treants. The druid can add one lan- \nguage at 3rd level and one more every time \nhe advances a level above 3rd. (If the op- \ntional proficiency rules are used, it is the \ndruid’s choice whether or not to spend a \nproficiency slot on one or more of these lan- \nguages.) \nI \nI"
