    "text": "tions about what should and shouldn't talk, \nit is effective only on intelligent creatures. \nThus it has no effect on animals and the like. \nFurthermore, the audience must be watch- \ning the character since part of the deception \nis visual (\"Hey, his lips don't movel\"). Using \nventriloquism to get someone to look \nbehind him does not work, since the voice is \nnot actually behind him (this requires the \nnentn'loquisrn spell). All but those with the \ngullibility of children realize what is truly \nhappening. They may be amused-or they \nday not be. \nL'I \nWeaponsmithlng: This highly specialized \nproficiency enables a character to perfom \nthe difficult and highly exacting work \ninvolved in making metal weapons, particu- \nlarly those with blades. The character \nblends some of the skill of the blacksmith \nwith an ability to create blades of strength \nand sharpness. A fully equipped smithy is \nnecessary to use this proficiency. \nThe time and cost to make various types \nof weapons are listed on Table 41. \nTable 41: WEAPON CONSTRUCTION \nConstruction Material \nWeapon Time cost \nArrowhead 10/day 1cP \nBattle Axe 10 davs 10 SD \nL. Crossbow 15 days 5 sp \nShort Sword 20 days 5 SP \nLone Sword 30 davs 10 SD \nWeather Sense: This proficiency enables \nthe character to make intelligent guesses \nabout upcoming weather conditions. A suc- \ncessful proficiency check means the charac- \nter has correctly guessed the general weath- \ner conditions in the next six hours. A failed \ncheck means the character read the signs \nwrong and forecast the weather incorrectly. \nThe DM should roll the check secretly. A \nproficiency check can be made once every \nsix hours. However, for every six hours of \nobservation, the character gains a + 1 bonus \nto his ability score (as he watches the weath- \ner change, the character gets a better sense \nof what is coming). This modifier is cumula- \ntive, although sleep or other activity that \noccupies the attention of the character for a \nlong period negates any accumulated \nbonus. \nSometimes impending weather condi- \ntions are so obvious that no proficiency \ncheck is required. It is difficult not to notice \nthe tornado funnel tearing across the plain \nor the mass of dark clouds on the horizon \nobviously headed the character's way. In \nthese cases, the player should be able to \ndeduce what is about to happen to his char- \nacter anyway. \nWeaving: A character with weaving pro- \nficiency is able to create garments, tapes- \ntries, and draperies from wool or cotton. \nThe character requires a spinning apparatus \nand a loom. A weaver can meat \nyards of material per day. \n65"
