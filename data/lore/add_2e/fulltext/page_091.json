    "text": "Combat (Weapon Type vs. Armor) \nHeres the same example, with some com- \nmon modifiers thrown in: Ruth is still a 7th- \nlevel fighter. He has a Strength of 18/80 \n(which gives him a +2 bonus to his attack \nroll). He fights with a long sword +l. His \nTHACO is 14, modified to I2 by his Strength \nand to 11 by his weapon. If attacking the orc \nfrom the earlier example, Ruth would have \nto roll a 5 or higher on la20 in order to hit \n(I1 -6~5). Again, Table 44 would tell him \nhow much damage he inflicts with his \nweapon (this information should also be \nwritten on his character sheet). \nThe DM may also throw in situational \nmodifiers, (e.g., a bonus if the target is \nstruck from behind, or a penalty if the target \nis crouching behind a boulder). If the final, \nmodified die roll on Id20 is equal to or \ngreater than the number needed to hit the \ntarget, the attack succeeds. If the roll is \nlower than that needed, the attack fails. \nModifiers to the Attack Roll \nIn combat, many \nfactors can modify the number a character \nneeds for a successful hit. These variables \nare reflected in modifiers to the to-hit num- \nber or to the attack roll. \nStrength Modifiers: A character‘s \nStrength can modify the die roll, altering \nboth the chance to hit and the damage \ncaused. This modifier is always applied to \nmelees and attacks with hurled missile \nweapons (a spear or an axe). \nA positive Strength modifier can be applied \nto bows if the character has a special bow \nmade for him, designed to take advantage of \nhis high Strength. Characters with Strength \nTable 51: COMBAT MODIFIERS \nSituation \nAttacker on \nDefender invisible - \nDefender off-balance \nDefender sleeping or held \nDefender stunned or prone \nDefender surprised \nMissile fire, long range \nMissile fire, medium range \nRear attack \nAttack Roll \nModifier \n+1 \n-4 \n+2 \nAutomatic* \n+4 \n+1 \n-5 \n-2 \n+2 \n*If the defender is attacked during the \ncourse of a normal melee, the attack auto- \nmatically hits and causegmal damage. If \nno other fighting is going on (i.e., all others \nhave been slain or driven off), the defender \ncan be slain automatically. \npenalties always suffer them when using a \nbow weapon. They simply are not able to \ndraw back the bowstring far enough. Charac- \nters never have Strength modifiers when using \na&ws-the power of the shot is imparted \nby a machine, not the player character. \nMagical items: The magical properties of \na weapon can also modify combat. Items \nthat impart a bonus to the attack roll or Ar- \nmor Class are identified by a plus sign. For \nexample, a sword + 1 improves a character’s \nchance to hit by one. A suit of chain mail \n+I improves the Armor Class of the char- \nacter by one (which means you subtract one \nfrom the character’s AC, changing an AC of \n5 to an AC of 4, for example). Cursed items \nhave a negative modifier (a penalty), result- \ning in a subtraction from the attack roll or \nan addition to Armor Class. \nThere is no limit to the number of modi- \nfiers that can be applied to a single die roll. \nNor is there a limit to the positive or nega- \ntive number (the total of all modifiers) that \ncd be applied to a die roll. \nTable 51 lists some standard combat mod- \nifiers. Positive numbers are bonuses for the \nattacker; negative numbers are D \nTable 52: WEAPON TYPE VS. \nARMORMODmERS \nfield Plate +3 +1 0 \n+4 +3 0 Full Hate \nsplint mail 0 +l +2 \nStuddcdkther +2 +1 0 \nIncludes bronze chain mail \n** Indudes padded armor znd hides \nSometimes the at- \ntacker’s to-hit number seems impossible to \nroll. An attack may be so difficult it requires \na roll greater than 20 (on a 20-sided die!), or \nso ridiculously easy it can be made on a roll \nless than 1. In both cases, an attack roll is \nstill required! \nThe reason is simple: With positive die \nroll modifiers (for magic, Strength, situa- \ntion, or whatever), a number greater than \n20 can be rolled. Likewise, die roll penalties \ncan push the attack roll below 0. \nNo matter what number a character needs \nY \n1 , \nI"
