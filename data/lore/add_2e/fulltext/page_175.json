    "text": "Each jump reduces the strength of the light- \nning by ld6. Each creature or magical object \nhit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success \non this save indicates the creature suffers \nonly half damage from the bolt. \nThe chain can strike as many times (in- \ncluding the first object or creature) as the \nspell caster has levels, although each crea- \nture or object can be struck only once. \nThus, a bolt cast by a 12th-level wizard can \nstrike up to 12 times, causing less damage \nwith each strike, The bolt continues to arc \nuntil it has struck the appropriate number of \nobjects or creatures, until it strikes an object \nthat grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of \na large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, \netc.), or until there are no more objects or \ncreatures to strike. \nDirection is not a consideration when \nplotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a \nfactor-an arc cannot exceed the spell's \nrange. If the only possible arc is greater than \nthe spell's range, the stroke fades into noth- \ningness. Creatures immune to electrical at- \ntack can be struck, even though no damage \nis taken. Note that it is possible for the chain \nto arc back to the caster! \nThe material components are a bit of fur, \na piece of amber, glass, or crystal rod, and \none silver pin for each experience level of \nthe caster. \nConJure Animals \n(ConjwatiodSummoning) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 6 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThe conjure animals spell enables the wiz- \nard to magically create one or more mam- \nmals to attack his opponents. The total Hit \nDice of the mammals cannot exceed twice \nhis level, if determined randomly, or his \nlevel if a specific animal type is requested \n(see the Dungeon Muster's Guide). Thus, a \nwizard of 12th level could randomly conjure \ntwo mammals with 12 Hit Dice, four with 6 \nHit Dice each, six with 4 Hit Dice each, eight \nwith 3 Hit Dice each, twelve with 2 Hit Dice \neach, or 24 with 1 Hit Die each. Count every \n+1 hit point bonus of a creature as 114 of a \nHit Die, thus a creature with 4 +3 Hit Dice \nequals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The con- \njured animal(s) remain for one round for \neach level of the conjuring wizard, or until \nslain. They follow the caster's verbal com- \nmands. Conjured animals unfailingly attack \nthe wizards opponents, but they resist being \nused for any other purpose. \nContingency (Evocation) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto place another spell upon his person so \nthat the latter spell will come into effect un- \nder the conditions dictated during the cast- \ning of the contingency spell. The \ncontingency spell and the spell it is to bring \ninto effect are cast at the same time (the one- \nturn casting time indicated is the total for \nboth castings). \nThe spell to be brought into effect by the \nprescribed contingency must be one that af- \nfects the wizards peison (feather fall, levita- \ntion, fly, feign death, etc.) and is of a spell \nlevel no higher than V3 of the caster's experi- \nence level (rounded down), but not higher \nthan the 6th spell level. \nCaster Level Contingency Spell Level \n12th-14th 4th \n15th-17th 5th \n18th + 6th \nOnly one contingency spell can be placed \non the spellcaster at any one time; if a sec- \nond is cast, the first one (if still active) is \ncancelled. The conditions needed to bring \nthe spell into effect must be clear, although \nthey can be rather general. For example, a \ncontingency spell cast with an airy water \nspell might prescribe that any time the wiz- \nard is plunged into or otherwise engulfed in \nwater or similar liquid, the airy water spell \nwill instantly come into effect. Or a contin- \ngency could bring a feather fall spell into ef- \nfect any time the wizard falls more than two \nfeet. In all cases, the contingency immedi- \nately brings into effect the second spell, the \nlatter-being \"cast\" instantaneously when the \nprescribed circumstances occur. Note \nthat if complicated or convoluted condi- \ntions are prescribed, the whole spell com- \nplex (the contingency spell and the cbmpan- \nion magic) may fail when called upon. \nThe material components of this spell are \n(in addition to those of the companion spell) \n100 gp worth of quicksilver and an eyelash \nof an ogre mage, ki-rin, or similar spell- \nusing creature. In addition, the speU re- \nquires a statuette of the wizard carved from \nelephant ivory (which is not destroyed, \nthough it is subject to wear and tear), which \nmust be carried on the person of the spell- \ncaster for the contingency spell to perfom \nits function when called upon. \nControl Weather (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4d6 hours \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: 4d4 square miles \nSaving Throw: None \nThe control mather spell enables a wiz- \nard to change the weather in the local area. \nThe spell affects the weather for 4d6 hours \nin an area of 4d4 square miles. It requires \none turn to cast the spell, and an additional \nld4 turns for the weather conditions to oc- \ncur. The current weather conditions are de- \ncided by the DM, depending on the climate \nand season. Weather conditions have three \ncomponents: precipitation, temperature, \nand wind. The spell can change these condi- \ntions according to the following chart. \nThe upper-cased headings reprosent the \nexisting weather conditions. The small \nheadings beneath each large heading are the \nnew conditions to which the caster can \nchange the existing conditions. Further- \nmore, the caster can control the direction of \nthe wind. For example, a day that is clear \nand warm with moderate wind can be con- \ntrolled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Con- \ntradictions are not possible-fog and strong \nwind, for example.
