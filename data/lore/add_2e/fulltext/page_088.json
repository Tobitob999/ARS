    "text": "it \nMagic (Spell Descriptions) \nwise noted. Clerical holy symbols are not \nlost when a spell is cast. For cases in which \nmaterial components are expended at the \nend of the spell (free action, shapechange, \netc.), premature destruction of the compo- \nnents ends the spell. \nDuration: This lists how long the magical \nenergy of the spell lasts. Spells of instanta- \nneous duration come and go the moment \nthey are cast, although the results of these \nspells may be permanent and unchangeable \nby normal means. Spells of permanent \nduration last until the effects are negated by \nsome means, usually by a dispel magic. \nSome spells have a variable duration. In \nmost cases, the caster cannot choose the \nduration of spells. Spells with set durations \n(e.g., 3 roundsAeve1) must be kept track of \nby the player. Spells of variable duration \n(e.g., 3 + ld4 rounds) are secretly rolled \nand recorded by the DM. Your DM may \nwarn you when spell durations are \napproaching expiration, but there is usually \nno sign that a spell is going to expire; check \nwith your DM to determine exactly how he \nhandles this issue. \nCertain spells can be ended at will by the \ncaster. In order to dismiss these spells, the \noriginal caster must be within range of the \nspell’s center of effect-within the same \nrange at which the spell can be cast. The \ncaster also must be able to speak words of \ndismissal. Note that only the original caster \ncan dismiss his spells in this way. \nCasting Time: This entry is important, if \nthe optional casting time rules are used. If \nonly a number is given, the casting time is \nadded to the caster’s initiative die rolls. If \nthe spell requires a round or number of \nrounds to cast, it goes into effect at the end \nof the last round of casting time. If \nDelsenora casts a spell that takes one round, \nit goes into effect at the end of the round in \nwhich she begins casting. If the spell \nrequires three rounds to cast, it goes into \neffect at the end of the third round. Spells \nrequiring a turn or more go into effect at the \nend of the stated turn. \nArea of Effect: This lists the creatures, \nvolume, dimensions, weight, etc., that can \nbe affected by the spell. Spells with an area \nor volume that can be shaped by the caster \nwill have a minimum dimension of 10 feet in \nany direction, unless the spell description \nspecifically states otherwise. Thus a cloud \nthat has a 10-foot cube per caster level \nmight, when cast by a 12th-level caster, \nhave dimensions 10’ x 10‘ x 120’, 20’ x \n20‘ X 30’, or any similar combinafion that \ntotals twelve 10-foot cubes. Combinations \nsuch as 5‘ X 10‘ X 240’ are not possible \nunless specifically allowed. \nSome spells (such as bless) affect the \nfriends or enemies of the caster. In all cases, \nthis refers to the perception of the caster at \nthe time the spell is cast. For example, a cha- \notic go.od character allied with a lawful neu- \ntral cleric would receive the benefits of the \nlatter’s bless spell. \nSaving Throw: This lists whether the spell \nallows the target a saving throw and the \neffect of a successful save: “Neg.” results in \nthe spell having no effect; “Vz“ means the \ncharacter suffers half the normal amount of \ndamage; “none” means no saving throw is \nallowed. \nWisdom adjustments to saving throws \napply to enchantment/charm spells. \nSolid physical barriers provide saving \nthrow bonuses and damage reduction. Cov- \ner and concealment may affect saving \nthrows and damage (the DM has additional \ninformation about this). \nA creature that successfully saves against \na spell with no apparent physical effect \n(such as a cham, hold, or magic jar) may \nfeel a definite force or tingle that is Charac- \nteristic of a magical attack, if the DM \ndesires. But the exact hostile spell effect or \ncreature ability used cannot be deduced \nfrom this tingle. \nA being‘s camed equipment and posses- \nsions are assumed to make their saving \nthrows against special attacks if the creature \nmakes its saving throw, unless the spell spe- \ncifically states otherwise. If the creature fails \nits saving throw, or if the attack form is par- \nticularly potent, the possessions may \nrequire saving throws using either item sav- \ning throws (see the DMG) or the being’s sav- \ning throw. The DM will inform you when \nthis happens. \nAny character can voluntarily forgo a \nsaving throw. This allows a spell or similar \nattack that normally grants a saving throw \nto have full effect on the character. Like- \nwise, any creature can voluntarily lower its \nmagic resistance allowing a spell to auto- \nmatically function when cast on it. Forgoing \na saving throw or magic resistance roll need \nnot always be voluntary. If a creature or \ncharacter can be tricked into lowering \nresistance, the spell will have full effect, \neven if it is not the spell the victim believed \nhe was going to receive. The victim must \nconsciously choose to lower his. resistance; \nit isnot sufficient that heis caught off guard. \nFor example, a character would receive a \nsaving throw if a mage in the party suddenly \nattacked him with a fireball, even if the \nmage had been friendly to that point. How- \never, the same character would not receive a \nsaving throw if the mage convinced Mm \nthat he was about to receive a levitation \nspell but cast a fireball instead. Your QM \nwill decide when NPCs have lowered tM \nresistances. You must tell your DM wh \nyour character is voluntarily lowering \nresistance. \nSpell Jhcdption: The text provi \ncomplete description of how the spell func- \ntions and its game effects. It covers mast \ntypical uses of the spell, if there are more \nthan one, but cannot deal with every possi- \nble application players might find. in these \ncases, the spell information in the text \nshould provide guidance on how to ad*- \ncate the situation. \nSpells with multiple functions enable the \ncaster to select which function he wants to \nuse at the time of casting. Usually a single \nfunction of a multiple-function spell is \nweaker than a single-function spell of the \nsame level. \nSpell effects that give bonuses or penal \nto abilities, attack rolls, damage Falls \ning throws, etc., are not usually cumu \nwith each other or with other magic: the \nstrongest single effect applies. For example, \na fighter drinks a potion of giant strength \nand then receives the 2nd-level wizard spell \nstrength. Only the strongest magic (the \npotion) is effective. When the potiofi’k dum- \ntion ends, however, the strength speil is still \nin effect, until its duration also expires."
