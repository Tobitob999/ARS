These \nwhirl and flash around a central point, cre- \nating an immobile barrier. Any creature \nthat attempts to pass through the blade bar- \nrier suffers 8d8 points of damage in doing \nso. The plane of rotation of the blades can \nbe horizontal, vertical, or in between. Crea- \ntures within the area of the barrier when it is \ninvoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. \nspell. If this is successful, the blades are \navoided and no damage is suffered; the \ncreature escapes the area of the blade barrier \nby the shortest possible route. The barrier \nremains for three rounds for every experi- \nence level of the priest casting it. The barrier \ncan cover any area from as small as five feet \nsquare to as large as 60 feet square. \n(Conjnrat#onBummoning) \nSpke summoning \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounds/level \nCasting Time: 9 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nfie conjure animals spell enables the \npriest to magically create one or more mam- \nmals to attack his opponents. The total Hit \nDice of the mammals cannot exceed twice \nhis level, if the creature conjured is deter- \nmined randomly, or his level, if a specific \nanimal type is requested. The DM selects \nthe type of animal that appears if it is ran- \ndomly called. Thus, a pfiest of 12th level \ncould randomly conjure two mammals with \n12 Hit Dice each, four with 6 Hit Dice each, \nsix with 4 Hit Dice each, eight with 3 Hit \nDice each, 12 with 2 Hit Dice each, or 24 \nwith 1 Hit Die each. Count every +I hit \npoint added to a creature's Hit Dice as 1/4 of \na Hit Die. Thus a creature with 4+3 Hit \nDice equals a 43/4 Hit Dice creature. The \nconjured animals remain for two rounds for \neach level of the conjuring priest, or until \nslain, and they follow the caster's verbal \ncommands. Conjured animals unfailingly \nattack the priest's opponents, but resist \nbeing used for any other purpose; they do \nnot like it, become noticeably more difficult \nto control, and may refuse any action, \nbreak free, or turn on the caster, depending \non the nature of the creature and the details \nof the situation. The conjured animals die \nappear when slam. \nConjure Fire Elementill \n(ConjuratiodSummoning) \nReweraible \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: 80 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 6 rounds \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nUpon casting a conjure fire elemental \nspell, the caster opens a special gate to the \nelemental plane of Fire, and a fire elemental \nis summoned to the vicinity of the spellcast- \ner. It is 65% likely that a 12 Hit Dice elemen- \ntal appears, 20% likely that a 16 Hit Dice \nelemental appears, 9% likely that two to \nfour salamanders appear, 4% likely that an \nefreeti appears, and 2% likely that a huge \nfire elemental of 21 to 24 Hit Dice appears. \nThe conjuring caster need not fear that the \nelemental force summoned will turn on him, \nso concentration upon the activities of the \nfire elemental (or other creatures summon- \ned) or protection from the creature is not \nnecessary. The elemental summoned helps \nthe caster however possible, including \nattacking opponents of the caster. The fire \nelemental or other creature summoned \nremains for a maximum of one turn per level \nof the caster, or until it is slain, sent back by \na dispel mugic spell, the reverse of this spell \n(dismiss fire elemental), or similar magic. \nFind the Path (Divination) \nReveralble \nSphere: Divination \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 rounds \nArea of Effect: Creature touched \nSaving Throw: None \nThe recipient of this spell can find the \nshortest, most direct physical route that he \nis seeking, be it the way into or out of a \nlocale. The locale can be outdoors or under \nground, a trap, or even a muze spell. Note \nthat the spell works with respect to locales, \nnot objects or creatures within a locale. \nThus, the spell could not find the way to \"a \nforest where a green dragon lives\" or to the \nlocation of \"a hoard of platinum pieces.\" \nThe location must be in the same plane as \nthe caster. \nThe spell enables the subject to sense the \ncorrect direction that will eventually lead \nhim to his destination, indicating at the \nappropriate times the exact path to follow \n(or physical actions to take-for example, \nwith concentration the spell enables the sub- \nject to sense trip wires or the proper word to \nbypass a glyph). The spell ends when the \ndestination is reached or when one turn for \neach caster level has elapsed. The spell frees \nthe subject, and those with him, from a \nmuze spell in a single ruund, and will con- \ntinue to do so as long as the spell lasts. \nNote that this divination is keyed to the \ncaster, not his companions, and that, like \nthe find trups spell, it does not pndict (w \nallow for the actions of creatures. \nThe spell requires a set of divination \ncounters of the sort favored by the priest- \nbones, ivory counters, sticks, carved -, \nor whatever. \nThe reverse spell, lose the path, makes the \ncreature touched totally lost and mbk to \nfind its way for the duration of the Spctu, \nalthough it can be led, of course. \nFin Seeds (Conjumthn) \nSphere: Elemental (Fire) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time 1 round/& \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: 1/2 \nor timed incendiaries that burn with ~t \nheat. The spell can be cast to create eidra \nfire seed missiles or fire reedinccrdipnles, a$ \nchosen whm the spelI is cast. \n*Fb?Beedmissiles:Thi$W~tum,rPp+ \nto four acorns into spcdal grenadelike rrrie- \nsiles that can be hwltd up to @yards.

This casting rurns \nup to eight holly berries into specla1 inoendi- \naries. The holly berries aze most ob \nplaced, being too light to make effective \nmissiles (they can be tossed up to six feet \naway). They burst into flame if the caster is \nmand. The berries instantly ignite, causing \nld8 points of damage to any creature and \nigniting any codustible within a five-foot- \ndiameter burst area. Creatures within the \narea that suctmsfully save vs. spell suffer \nhalf damage. \nAll fire seeds lose their power after a \nduration equal to one turn per experience \nlevel of the caster-e.g., the seeds of a 13th- \nlevel caster remain potent for a maximum of \n4 \nl \nI \nI 1 \nThe fire seeds spell creates special \nwithin 40 yards and speaks 4 wotd of COUI- \n227"
