These include \nall colors of the visible spectrum; each ray \nhas a different power and purpose. Any \nend, 5' wide at base \ncreature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck \nby a ray is blinded for 2d4 rounds, regard- \nless of any other effect. \nAny creature in the area of effect will be \ntouched by one or more of the rays.

The \nreverse gravity lasts as long as the caster \ndesires or until the spell expires. If some \nsolid object is encountered in this \"fall,\" the \nobject strikes it in the same manner as it \nwould during a normal downward fall. At \nthe end of the spell duration, the affected \nobjects and creatures fall downward. As the \nspell affects an area, objects tens, hundreds, \nor even thousands of feet in the air above \nthe area can be affected. \nThe material components of this spell are \na lodestone and iron filings. \nsequcst- \n(IllusialdPhantasm, Abjuration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 week + 1 day/level \nCasting Time: 7 \nArea of Effect: &foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen cast, this spell not only prevents \ndetection and location spells from working \nto detect or locate the objects affected by the \nsequester spell, it also renders the affected \nobject(s) invisible to any form of sight or \nseeing. Thus, a sequester spell can mask a \nsecret door, a treasure vault, or whatever. \nOf course, it does not render the subject \nproof from tactile discovery or from \ndevices, such as a robe of eyes or a gem of \nseeing. If cast upon a creature not desiring \nto be affected, a normal saving throw vs. \nspell is given. Living creatures (and even \nundead types) affected by a sequester spell \nbecome comatose and are effectively in a \nstate of suspended animation until the spell \nwears off or is dispelled. \nThe material components of the spell are \na basilisk eyelash, gum arabic, and a dram \nof whitewash. \nShadow Walk @lusion, Enchantment) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 6 turns/level \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nIn order to use the shadow walk spell, the \nwizard must be in an area of heavy \nshadows. The caster and any creature he \ntouches are then transported to the edge of \nthe Prime Material plane where it borders \nthe plane of Shadow. In this region the wiz- \nard can move at a rate of up to seven miles \nper turn, moving normally on the borders \nof the plane of Shadow but much more rap- \nidly relative to the Prime Material plane. \nThus rapid travel can be accomplished by \nmoving in the plane of Shadow and then \nstepping from the plane of Shadow to the \nPrime Material plane. The wizard knows \nwhere he will come out on the Prime Materi- \nal plane. \nThe shadow walk spell can also be wed to \ntravel to other planes that border on the \nplane of Shadow, but this requires the \npotentially perilous transit of the pkne of \nShadow to arrive at a border with andm \nplane of reality. Any creatures touched by \nthe wizard when shadow walk is cast also \nmake the transition to the borders of the \nplane of Shadow. They may opt to follow \nthe wizard, wander off into Shadowland, or \nstumble back into the Prime Material plane \n(50% chance for either result if \nunwilling to accompany the wiud i#wr tbr \nor abandoned by the wizard). \nplane of Shadow get a saving th. \ning the effect if successful. \n?!!&z!z lr/' \nI' \nSlmulacrum (Illtlsion/phmt.rm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Permangt \nCasting Time: Special \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard is able \nto create a duplicate of any creature. The \nduplicate appears to be exactly the same as \nthe original, but there are differences; the \nsimulacrum has only 51% to 60% (50% + \nIdlo%) of the hit points of the real creature, \nthere are personality differences, there are \nareas of knowledge that the duplicate does \nnot have, and a detect magic spell will \ninstantly reveal it as a simulacrum, as wiil a \ntrue seeing spell. At all times the simula- \ncrum remains under the absolute command \nof the wizard who created it. No special tele- \npathic link exists, so command must be \nexercised in some other manner. The spell \ncreates the form of the creature, but it is \nonly a zombie-like creation. A reincarna- \ntion spell must be used to give the duplicate \na vital force, and a limited wish spell must \nbe used to empower the duplicate with 40% \nto 65% (35% + 5 to 30%) of the knowledge \nand personality of the original. The level, if \nany, of the simulacrum is from 20% to 50% \nof that of the original creature. \nThe duplicate creature is formed from ice \nor snow. The spell is cast over the rough \nform ahd some piece of the creature to be \nduplicated must be placed inside the snow \nor ice. Additionally, the spell requires pow- \ndered ruby. \nThe simulacrum has no ability to become \nmorepowerful: it cannot increase its level or \nabilities. If destroyed, it reverts to snow and \nmelts into nothingness. Damage to the simula- \naum can be repaid by a complex process \nreguiringat least one day, lOOgp per hit point, \nand a fully equipped laboratory. \nE \n186"
