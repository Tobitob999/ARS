Just \nthen there is a flash of flame all around \nhim-a fireball! He grits his teeth against \nthe .heat, shock, and pain and tries to \nremember not to crush or spill the potion \nvial, Biting back the pain of the flames, he is \nrelieved to see the potion is still intact. \nQuiddy, he gulps it down, ledaims his \nsword, kicks his backpack out of the way, \nand runs back up to the front line. In game \nterms, the character withdrew, was missed \nby one attacker, made a successful saving \nthrow vs. spell (from the fireball), drank a \npotion, and was ready for combat the next \nround. \nI \nI What You Can Do In One Round \nWhatever the pre- \nround, a character \nan accomplish only one basic action in that \nround, be-it making an attack, casting a \nspell, drinking a potion, or tending to a \nfallen comrade. The basic action, however, \nmay involve several lesser actions. \nWhen making an attack, a character is \nlikely to close with his opponent, circle for \nilll opening, feint here, jab there, block a \nthrust, leap back, and perhaps finally make \na telling blow. A spellcaster may fumble for \nhis components, dodge an attacker, mental- \nly review the steps of the spell, intone the \nspell, and then move to safety when it is all \ndone. It has already been shown what \ndrinking a potion might entail. All of these \nthings might happen in a bit less than a min- \nute or a bit more, but the standard is one \nminute and one action to the round. \nSome examples of the actions a character \ncan accomplish include the following: \nMake an attack (make attack rolls up to \nthe maximum number allowed the char- \nacter class at a given level) \nCast one spell (if the casting time is one \nround or less) \nDrink a potion \nLight a torch \nUse a magical item \nMove to the limit of his movement rate \nAttempt to open a stuck or secret door \nBind a character's wounds \nSearchabody \nHammer in a spike \nRecover a dropped weapon \nThere are also actions that take a negligi- \nble amount of time, things the character \ndoes without afkting his ability to perform \na more important task. Examples of these \ninclude the following: \nShout warnings, brief instructions, or \ndemands for surrender, but not conversa- \ntions where a reply is expected. \nChange welrpons by dropping one and \ndrawing anhther. \nDrop excess equipment, such as back- \npacks, lanterns, or torches. \nThe Combat Sequence \nIn real life, combat \nis one of the closest things to pure anarchy. \nEach side is attempting to harm the other, \nessentially causing disorder and chaos. \nThus combats are filled with unknowns- \nunplanned events, failed attacks, lack of \ncommunication, and general confusion and \nuncertainty. However, to play a battle in the \ngame, it is necessary to impose some order \non the actions that occur. Within a combat \nround, there is a set series of steps that must \nbe followed. These steps are: \n1. The DM decides what actions the \nmonsters or NPCs will take, including \ncasting spells (if any). \n2. The players indicate what their char- \nacters will do, including casting spells \n(if any). \n3. Initiative is determined. \n4. Attacks are made in order of initiative. \nThese steps are followed until the combat \nends-either one side is defeated, surren- \nders, or runs away, \nNPC/Monster Determination: In the first \nstep, the DM secretly decides in general \nterms what each opponent will do-attack, \nflee, or cast a spell. He does not announce \nhis decisions to the players. If a spell is to be \ncast, the DM picks the spell before the play- \ners announce their characters' actions. \nPlayer Determination: Next, the players \ngive a general indication of what their char- \nacters are planning to do. This does not \nhave to be perfectly precise and can be \nchanged somewhat, if the DM decides cir- \ncumstances warrant. \nIf the characters are battling goblins, a \nplayer can say, \"My fighter will attack \nwithout having to announce which goblin \nhe will strike, If the characters are battling a \nmixed group of goblins and ogres, the play- \ner has to state whether his character is \nattacking goblins or ogres. \nSpells to be cast must also be announced \nat this time and cannot be changed once the \ninitiative die is rolled. \nBefore moving on, the DM will make sure \nhe has a clear idea of not only what the play- \ner characters are doing, but also what \nactions any hirelings and henchmen are tak- \ning. Once he has a clear view of everything \nthat's likely to happen, the DM can overrule \nany announced action that violates the rules \n(or in the case of an WC, is out of charac- \nter). \nHe is not required to overrule an impos- \nsible action, but he can let a character \nattempt it anyway, knowing full well the \ncharacter cannot succeed. It is not the DMs \nposition to advise players on the best strate- \n93 \ngies, most intelligent actions, or opti \nmaneuvers for their characters. \nInftiptive: In the third step, dice are rolled \nto determine initiative, according to the \nrules for initiative (this page). \nResolution: In the last step, PCs, NPCs, \nand monsters make their attacks, spens \noccur, and any other actions are resolved \naccording to the order of hitiative. \nThe above sequence is not immutable. \nIndeed, some monsters violate the standard \nsequence, and some situations demand the \napplication of common sense. In these cases \nthe DM's word is final. \nHere's an example of the combat sequence \nin action: Rath is leading a party through \nthe corridors of a dungeon. Right behind \nhim are Rupert and Dehora. Rounding a \nbend, they see a group of orcs and trolls \nabout 20 feet may. No one is surprised by \nthe encounter, \ngoing to.. .now I can't use a fireball.\" \nDM: \"Rath is charging forward. Quick- \nwhat are you doing?\" \nJon: \"OK, I'll shoot \nAnne: '<Got it!-Acid arrow spell ut the Zead \nanother. \nInitiative is normally determined with a \nsingle roll for each side in a conflict. This \ntells whether all the members of the group \nget to act before or after those of the other \nthese optional methods breaks the"
