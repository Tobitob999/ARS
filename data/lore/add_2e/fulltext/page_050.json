    "text": "for the peasant, he could not allow the two \nfiends to mock him. Still, there was no rea- \nson for him to risk all for one peasant. If \nforced to retreat, he could return with a \nstronger force, capture the criminals, and \nexecute them publicly. If the peasant died in \nthe meantime, their punishment would be \nthat much more horrible. \nThe lawful neutral character was willing \n,_ to fight, because the villains threatened pub- \nlic order. However, he was not willing to \nrisk his own life. He would have preferred \nto come back later with reinforcements. If \nthe peasant could be saved, that is good, \nbecause he is part of the community. If not, \nit would be unfortunate but unavoidable. \nThe neutral good character did not fight \nthe gorgon or the warrior, but he tried to \nrescue the peasant. Saving the peasant was \nworthwhile, but there was no need to risk \ninjury and death along the way. Thus, while \nthe enemy was distracted in combat, he \ntried to slip past and free the peasant. \nThe true neutral character weighed the \nsituation carefully. Although it looked like \nthe forces working for order would have the \nupper hand in the battle, he knew there had \nbeen a peral trend toward chaos and \ndestruction in the region that must be com- \nba ed. He tried to help, but if the group \nfa&, he could work to restore the balance \nof bw and chaos elsewhere in the kingdom. \nThe neutral evil character cared nothing \nabout law, order, or the poor peasant. He \nfi that there had to be some treasure \naround somewhere. After all, the villain's \nlair had once been a powerful temple. He \ncould poke around for cash while the others \ndid the real work. If the group got into real \ntrouble and it looked like the villains would \nattack him, then he would fight. Unfortu- \nnately, a stray magical arrow killed him just \nafter he found a large gem. \nThe chaotic good character joined the \nfight for several reasons. Several people in \nthe group were his friends, and he wanted to \nfight at their sides. Furthermore, the poor, \nkidnapped peasant deserved to be rescued. \nThus, the chaotic good character fought to \naid his companions and save the peasant. \nHe didn't care if the villains were killed, cap- \ntured, or just driven away. Their attacks \nagainst the village didn't concern him. \nThe chaotic neutral character decided to \ncharge, screaming bloodthirsty cries, \nstraight for the gorgon. Who knows? He \nmight have broken its nerve and thrown it \noff guard. He discovered that his plan was a \nbad one when the gorgon's breath killed \nhim. \nThechaotic evil character saw no point in \nrisking his hide for the villagers, the peas- \nant, or the rest of the party. In fact, he \nthought of several good reasons not to. If \nthe party was weakened, he might be able to \ntake over. If the villains won, he could prob- \nably make a deal with them and join their \nside. If everyone was killed, he could take \neverything he wanted and leave. All these \nsounded a lot better than getting hurt for lit- \ntle or no gain. So he stayed near the back of \nthe battle, watching. If anyone asked, he \ncould say he was watching the rear, making \nsure no one came to aid the enemy. \nThe two preceding examples of alignment \nare extreme situations. It's not very likely \nthat a player will ever play in a group of \nalignments as varied as those given here. If \nsuch a group ever does form, players should \nseriously reconsider the alignments of the \ndifferent members of the party1 More often, \nthe adventuring party will consist of charac- \nters with relatively compatible alignments. \nEven then, players who role-play their char- \nacters' alignments will discover small issues \nof disagreement. \nChanging Alignment \nAlignment is a tool, \nnot a straitjacket. It is possible for a player \nto change his character's alignment after the \ncharacter is created, either by action or \nchoice. However, changing alignment is not \nwithout its penalties. \nMost often the character's alignment will \nchange because his actions are more in line \nwith a different alignment. This can happen \nif the player is not paying attention to the \ncharacter and his actions. The character \ngradually assumes a different alignment. \nFor example, a lawful good fighter ignores \nthe village council's plea for help because he \nwants to go fight evil elsewhere. This action \nis much closer to chaotic good, since the \ncharacter is placing his desire over the need \nof the community. The fighter would find \nhimself beginning to drift toward chaotic \ngood alignment. \nAll people have minor failings, however, \nso the character does not instantly become \nchaotic good. Several occasions of lax \nbehavior are required before the chatacter's \nalignment changes officially. During that \ntime, extremely lawful good activities can \nswing the balance back, Although the play- \ner may have a good idea of where the char- \nacter's alignment lies, only the DM knows \nfor sure. I \nLikewise, the character cannot wake up \none morning and say, \"I think I'll become \nlawful good tday.\" (Well, he can say it, but \nit won't have any effect.) A player can \nchoose to change his character's alignment, \nbut this change is accomplished by deeds, \nnot words. %ll the DM of the intention and \nthen try to play according to the new \nchoice. \nFinally, there are many magical effects \nthat can change a character's alignment. \nRare and cursed magical items can instantly \nalter a character's alignment. Powerful arti- \nfacts may slowly erode a character's deter- \nmination and willpower, \n49 \nshifts in behavior. Spells can compel a char- \nacter to perform actions against his 4. \nAlthough all of these have an effect, nme \nare as permanent or damaging as those \nchoices the character makes of his own free \nwill. \nChanging the way a character behaves \nand thinks will cost him experience paints \nand slow his advancement. Part of a charac- \nter's experience comes from learning how \nhis own behavior affects him and the world \naround him. In real life, for example, a per- \nson learns that he doesn't like horror movies \nonly by going to see a few of them. Based on \nthat experience, he learns to avoid certain \ntypes of movies. Changing behavior means \ndiscarding things the character learned pre- \nviously. Relearning things takes time. This \ncosts the character experience. \nThere are other, more immediate effects \nof changing alignment. Certain character \nclasses require specific alignments. A pala- \ndin who is no longer lawful good is no long- \ner a paladin. A character may have magical \nitems usable only by specific al-ts \n(intelligent swords, etc.). Such item don't \nfunction (and may even prove dangwms) in \nthe hands of a differently aligned Character. \nNews of a character's change in behavior \nwill certainly get around to friends and \nacquaintances. Although some people he \nnever considered friendly may now warm to \nhim, others may take exception to his new \nattitudes. A few may even try to help him \n\"see the error of his ways.\" The loa1 clergy, \non whom he relies for healing, may look \naskance on his recent behavior, denying him \ntheir special services (while at the same time \nsermonizing on his plight). The cher2cter \nwho changes alignment often finds himself \nunpopular, depending on the attitudes of \nthe surrounding people. People! do not \nunderstand him. If the character drifts into \nchaotic neutral behavior in a highly lawful \ncity, the townspeople might decide that the \ncharacter is afflicted and needs close super- \nvision, even confinement, for his own gdk \nUltimately, the player is advised to pick \nan alignment he can play comfortably, om \nthat fits in with those of the rest of thg"
