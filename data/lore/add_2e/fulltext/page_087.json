Without them, he is helpless, even \nif the spell is memorized.

This is not a jobhe does \nfor you! Without your input, nothing hap \npens. Second, whatever your character \nresearches, it cannot be more powd than \nthe spells he is already able to cast. If it is, \nyou must wait until your character can cast \nspells of an equal power. (Thus, as a 1st- \nlevel wizard, you cannot research a spell \nthat is as powerful as a fireball. You must \nwait until yourcharactercancastafireball.) \nFinally, you will have to be patient and will- \ning to have your character spend some \nmoney. He won't create the spell immedi- \nately, as research takes time. It also takes \nmoney, so you can exjwct your DM to use \nthis opportunity to relieve your character of \nsome of that excess cash. But, after all, how \nbetter for a spellcaster to spend his money? \nKnowing these things, you should first \nwrite up a description of the spell you want \nto create. Be sure to include information on \ncomponents, saving throws, range, dura- \ntion, and all the other entries you find in the \nnormal spell listings. When you give your \nDM the written description, tell him what \nyou want the spell to do. (Sometimes what \nyou write isn't really what you mean, and \ntalking to your DM is a good way to prevent \nconfusion.) After this, he will either accept \nor reject yous: spell. This is his choice and \nnot all DMs will have the same answer. \nDon't kick and complain; find out what \nchanges are needed to make the spell accept- \nable. You can probably iron out the differ \nOnce all these things are done, your char- \nacter can research the spell. Be ready for this \nto take some time. Eventually he will suc- \nceed, dthough the spell may not do quite \nwhat he expected. Your DM may revise the \nspell, perhaps reducing the area of effect or \ndamage inflicted. Finally, all you have to do \nis name your spell. This should be some- \nthing suitably pompous, such as \"Del- \nsenora's Malevolent Steamroller.\" After all, \nyou want something to impress the locals! \nenCes. \nSpell Descr€pti&s \nThe spells are orga- \nnized according to their group (priest or \nwizard) and level, starting on page 131. \nWithin each level, the spells are arranged \nalphabetically. At the start of each spell \ndescription is the following important game \ninformation: \nName: Each spell is identified by name. In \nparentheses after the name is the school (for \nwizard spells) to which that spell belongs. \nWhen more than one is listed, that spell is \ncommon to all schools given. \nSome spells are reversible (they can be \ncast for an effect opposite to that of the \nstandard spell). This is noted after the spell \nname. Priests with reversible spells must \nmemorize the desired version. For example, \n86 \na priest who desires a cause light wounds \nspell must petition for this form of the are \nlight wounds spell when medita- and \npraying. Note that severe penalties can \nresult if the spell choice is at variance with \nthe priest's alignment (possible pedties \ninclude denial of specific speils, entire spelr \nlevels, or even all spells for a certain peri- \nod). The exact result (if any) depencts on the \nreaction of the priest's patron deity, as deter- \nmined by the DM. \nReversible wizard spells operate simi-. \nWhen the spell is learned, both forms 813 \nrecorded in the wizard's spell books. HOW- \never, the wizard must decide which version \nof the spell he desires to cast when memoriz- \ning the spell, unless the -11 description spe- \ncifically states ohenwe * . For example, a \nwizard who has 'kmorized stone to flesh \nand desires to cast flesh to stone must wait \nuntil the latter form of the spell can be mem- \norized(i.e., rest eight hoursandstudy). If he \ncould memorize two 6th-level spek he \ncould memorize each version once or one \nversion twice. \nSchool: In parentheses after the spell \nname is the name of the school of magic to \nwhich the spell belongs. For wizard spells, \nthis defines which spells a wizard specialist \ncan learn, depending on the wizards school \nof specialization. For priest spells, the \nschool notation is used only for reference \npurposes, to indicate which school the spell \nis considered to belong to, in case the DM \nneeds to know for spell resistance (e.g., \nelves' resistance to charm spells). \nSphere: This entry appears only for priest \nspells and identifies the sphere or spheres \ninto which that spell falls. \nRange: This lists the distance from the \ncaster at which the spell effect occurs or \nbegins. A \"0\" indicates the spell can be used \non the caster only, with the effect clnbodied \nwithin or emanating from him. 'Touch \nmeans the caster can use the spell on others \nif he can physically touch them. Unless oth- \nerwise specified, a11 other spells are centered \non a point visible'to the caster and within \nthe range of the spell. The point can be a \ncreature or object if desired. In general, a \nspell that affects a limited number of crea- \ntures within an area affects those closest to \nthe center of the area bt, unless there are \nother parameters operating (such as level or \nHit Dice). Spells can be cast through narrow \nopenings only if both the caster's vision and \nthe spell energy can be directed simultane- \nously through the opening. A wizard stand- \ning behind an arrow slit can cast through it; \nsending a fireball through a small peephole \nhe is peering through is another matter. \nComponents: This lists the category of \ncomponents needed, V for verbal, S for \nsomatic, and M for material. When material \ncomponents are required, these are listed in \nthe spell description. Spell components are \nexpended as the spell is cast, unless other-"
