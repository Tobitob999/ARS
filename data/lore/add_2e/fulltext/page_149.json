    "text": "Wizard Spells (3rd Level) \nmagical enhancements. If the area is magi- \ncally dark, only darkness is seen; if natu- \nrally pitch dark, only a 10-foot radius from \nthe center of the spell’s area of effect can be \nseen. Otherwise, the seeing extends to the \nnormal vision range according to the pre- \nvailing light. Lead sheeting or magical pro- \ntection foils a clairuoyance spell, and the \nwizard has some indication that it is so \nblocked. The spell creates an invisible sen- \nsor, similar to that created by a crystal ball \nspell, that can be dispelled. The spell func- \ntions only on the wizards current plane of \nexistence. \nThe material component is a pinch of \npowdered pineal gland. \nDelude (Alteration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nBy means of a delude spell, the wizard \nconceals his own alignment with that of any \ncreature within a 30-foot radius at the time \nthe spell is cast. The creature must be of \nhigher than animal intelligence for the spell \nto work; its own alignment remains un- \nchanged. The creature receives a saving \nthrow vs. spell and, if successful, the delude \nspell fails. If the spell is successful, any \nknow alignment spell used against the caster \ndiscovers only the assumed alignment. Note \nthat a detect good or detect evil also detects \nthe assumed aura, if the aura is strong \nenough. The creature whose aura has been \nassumed radiates magic, but the wizard ra- \ndiates magic only to the creature whose \nalignment has been assumed. If a delude \nspell is used in conjunction with a change \nself or alter self spell, the class of the wizard \ncan be totally hidden, if he is clever enough \nto carry off the disguise. \nDI-l Magic (Abjuration) \nRange: 120 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 30-foot cube \nSaving Throw: None \nWhen a wizard casts this spell, it has a \nchance to neutralize or negate magic it \ncomes in contact with, as follows: \nFirst, it removes spells and spell-like ef- \nfects (including device effects and innate \nabilities) from creatures or objects. Second, \nit disrupts the casting or use of these in the \narea of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. \nThird, it destroys magical potions (which \nare treated as 12th level for purposes of this \nspell). \nEach effect or potion in the spell’s area is \nchecked to determine if it is dispelled. The \ncaster can always dispel his own magic; oth- \nerwise the chance to dispel depends on the \ndifference in level between the magical ef- \nfect and the caster. The base chance is 50% \n(11 or higher on ldZ0 to dispel). If the caster \nis higher level than the creator of the effect \nto be dispelled, the difference is subtracted \nfrom the number needed on ld20 to dispel \n(thus making it more likely that the dispel \nsucceeds); if the caster is of lower level, then \nthe difference is added to the number \nneeded on Id20 to dispel (making it less \nlikely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 \nalways succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. \nThus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a \nroll of 1 prevents the effect from being dis- \npelled. \nA dispel magic spell does not affect a spe- \ncially enchanted item, such as a magical \nscroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous \nitem, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is \ncast directly upon the item. This renders the \nitem nonoperational for ld4 rounds. An \nitem possessed and carried by a creature \ngains the creature’s saving throw against \nthis effect, otherwise it is automatically ren- \ndered nonoperational. An interdimensional \ninterface (such as a bag of holding) rendered \nnonoperational would be temporarily \nclosed. Note that an item’s physical proper- \nties are unchanged: a nonoperational magi- \ncal sword is still a sword. \nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this \nspell; however, some of their spell-like ef- \nfects may be, at the DMs option. \nNote that this spell can be very effective \nwhen used upon charmed and similarly be- \nguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects \ncannot be dispelled; these are listed in the \nspell descriptions. \nExplosive Runes (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 10-foot radius \nSaving Throw: None or 1/2 \nBy tracing these mystic runes upon a \nbook, map, scroll, or similar object bearing \nwritten information, the wizard prevents \nunauthorized persons from reading his ma- \nterial. The explosive runes are difficult to \ndetect-5% chance per level of magic use \nexperience of the reader; thieves have only a \n5% chance. But trap detection by spell or \nmagical device always finds these runes. \nWhen read, the explosive runes detonate, \ndelivering 6d4 + 6 points of damage to the \nreader, who gets no saving throw. A like \namount, or half that if saving throws are \nmade, is suffered by each creature within \nthe blast radius. The wizard who cast the \nspell, as well as any he instructs, can read \nthe protected writing without triggering the \nrunes. Likewise, the wizard can remove the \nrunes whenever desired. Others can remove \nthem only with a successful dispel magic or \nerase spell. Explosive runes otherwise last \nuntil the spell is triggered. The item upon \nwhich the runes are placed is destroyed \nwhen the explosion takes place, unless it is \nnot normally subject to destruction by mag- \nical fire (see the Item Saving Throws in the \nDungeon Master’s Guide). \nSource of Effect \nCaster \nOther caster/innate ability \nWand \nStaff \nPotion \nOther magic \nArtif act \nSummary of Dakpel Magic Effects \nResists As Result of Dispel \nNone Dispel automatic \nLeveVHD of other caster \n6th level \n8th level \n12th level Potion destroyed \n12th. unless special * \nDM discretion DM discretion \nEffect negated \n* \n* Effect negated; if cast directly on item, item becomes nonoperational for ld4 rounds."
