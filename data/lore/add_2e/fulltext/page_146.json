Humans, demihumans, and hu- \nmanoids of man-size or less are reduced to \nan effective Strength of 5, losing all Strength \nbonuses and suffering an attack roll penalty \nof -2 and a -1 penalty to damage. Other \ncreatures suffer a penalty of -2 on attack \nrolls. Furthermore, they have a \n- 1 penalty for each die of damage they in- \nflict. (But no damage roll can inflict less \nthan 1 point per die of damage.) Your DM \nwill determine any other effects appropriate \nto the affected creature. If the target crea- \nture makes its saving throw, the spell has no \neffect. This spell does not affect combat bo- \nnuses due to magical items, and those con- \nferring increased Strength function \nnormally. \nRope Trick (Alteration) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 2 turns/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw. None \nWhen this spell is cast upon a piece of \nrope from five to 30 feet long, one end of the \nrope rises into the air until the whole hangs \nperpendicular, as if affixed at the upper end. \nThe upper end is, in fact, fastened to an ex- \ntradimensional space. The spellcaster and \nup to seven others can climb up the rope and \ndisappear into this place of safety where no \ncreature can find them. The rope can be \ntaken into the extradimensional space if \nfewer than eight persons have climbed it, \notherwise it simply stays hanging in the air \n(extremely strong creatures might be able to \nremove it, at the DMs option). Spells can- \nnot be cast across the interdimensional,in- \nterface, nor can area effects cross it. Those \nin the extradimensional space can see out of \nit as if there is a 3' x 5' window centered on \nthe rope. The persons in the extradimen- \nsional space must climb down prior to the \nend of the spell, or they are dropped from \nthe height at which they entered the extradi- \nmensional space. The rope can be climbed \nby only one person at a time. Note that the \nrope trick spell enables climbers to reach a \nnormal place if they do not climb all the way \nto the extradimensional space. Also note \nthat creating or taking extradimensional \nspaces into an existing extradimensional \nspace is hazardous. \nThe material components of this spell are \npowdered corn extract and a twisted loop of \nparchment. \nScare (EnchantmenVCharm) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld4 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 15-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nThis spell causes creatures with fewer \nthan 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall \ninto fits of trembling and shaking. The \nfrightened creatures have a -2 reaction ad- \njustment and may drop items held if encum- \nbered. If cornered, they fight, but with -1 \npenalties to attack and damage rolls, and to \nsaving throws as well. \nOnly elves, half-elves, and priests are al- \nlowed saving throws against this spell. Note \nthat this spell has no effect on the undead \n(skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and so on), or \non upper or lower planar creatures of any \nsort. \nThe material component used for this \nspell is a bit of bone from an undead skele- \nton, zombie, ghoul, ghast, or mummy. \nShatter (Alteration) \nRange: 30 yards + 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 3-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThe shatter spell is a sound-based attack \nthat affects nonmagical objects of crystal, \nglass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, \nbottles, flasks, jugs, windows, mirrors, etc. \nAll such objects within a three-foot radius \nof the center of the spell effect are smashed \ninto dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects \nweighing more than one pound per level of \nthe caster are not affected, but all other ob- \njects of the appropriate composition must \nsave vs. crushing blow or be shattered. Al- \nternatively, the spell can be focused against \na single item of up to 10 pounds per caster \nlevel. Crystalline creatures usually suffer \nId6 points of damage per caster level to a \nmaximum of 6d6, with a saving throw vs. \nspell for half damage. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nchip of mica. \nSpectral Hand (Necromancy) \nRange: 30 yards + 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 2 rounddlevel \nCasting Time: 2 \nArea of Effect: 1 opponent \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, \nshaped from the caster's life force, to materi- \nalize within the spell range and move as the \ncaster desires. Any touch attack spell of 4th \nlevel or less that is subsequently cast by the \nwizard can be delivered by the spectral \nhand. The spell gives the caster a +2 bonus \nto his attack roll. The caster cannot perfom \nany other actions when attacking with the \nhand; the hand returns to the caster and \nhovers if the caster takes other actions. ' ! \nhand lasts the full spell duration unless ais- \nmissed by the caster, and it is possible to use \nmore than one touch attack with it. The \nhand receives flank and rear attack bonuses \nif the caster is in a position to do so. The \nhand is vulnerable to magical attack (but it \nhas an Armor Class of -2). Any damage to \nthe hand ends the spell and inflicts ld4 \npoints of damage to the caster. \n. \nStinking Cloud (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration 1 round/level \nCasting Time:2 \nArea of Effect: 20-foot cube \nSaving Throw: Special I \nWhen a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard I \ncreates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors \nup to 30 yards away from his pitien. Any \ncreature caught within the cloud must roll a \nsuccessful saving throw vs. poison or be \nreeling and unable to attack because of MU- \nsea, for ld4 + 1 rounds after leaving the \ncloud. Those who make successful saving \nthrows can leave the cloud without &- \ning any ill effects, although those remaihiRg \nin the cloud must continue to save each \nround. These poisonous effects can be \nslowed or neutralized by appropriate \nmagic. The cloud duration is halved in a \nmoderate breeze (8-18 m.p.h) and is dis- \npersed in one round by a stronger breeze. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nrotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves. \nI \nI \n1 \nI \n145"
