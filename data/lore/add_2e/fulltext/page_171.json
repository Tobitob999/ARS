    "text": "Wizard Spells (5th Level) \nin which the casting is completed, allowing \nno other actions. \nWhile in the magic jar, the caster can \nsense and attack any life force within a 10- \nfoot-per-level radius (on the same plane); \nhowever, the exact creature types and rela- \ntive physical positions cannot be deter- \nmined. In a group of life forces, the caster \ncan sense a difference of four or more \nlevels/Hit Dice and can determine whether \na life force is positive or negative energy. For \nexample, if two 10th-level fighters are \nattacking a hill giant and four ogres, the \ncaster could determine that there are three \nstronger and four weaker life forces within \nrange, all with positive life energy. The cast- \ner could try to take over either a stronger or \na weaker creature, but he has no control \nover exactly which creature is attacked. \nAn attempt to take’over a host body \nrequires a full round. It is blocked by a pro- \ntection from evil spell or similar ward. It is \nsuccessful only if the subject fails a saving \nthrow vs. spell with a special modifier (see \nfollowing). The saving throw is modified by \nsubtracting the combined Intelligence and \nWisdom scores of the target from those of \nthe wizard (Intelligence and hit dice in non- \nhuman or nonhumanoid creatures). This \nmodifier is added to (or subtracted from) \nthe die roll. \nDifference Die Adjustment \n-9 or less +4 \n-8 to -6 +3 \n+13 or more -3 \nA negative score indicates that the wizard \nhas a lower total than the target, thus the \nhost has a saving throw bonus. Failure to \ntake over the host leaves the wizard’s life \nforce in the magic jar. \nIf successful, the caster’s life force occu- \npies the host body and the host’s life force is \nconfined in the magic jar receptacle. The \ncaster can call upon rudimentary or instinc- \ntive knowledge of the subject creature, but \nnot upon its real or acquired knowledge \n(i.e., the wizard does not automatically \nknow the language or spells of the creature). \nThe caster retains his own attack rolls, class \nknowledge and training, and any adjust- \nments due to his Intelligence or Wisdom. If \nthe host body is human or humanoid, and \nthe necessary spell components are availa- \nble, the wizard can even use his memorized \nspells. The host body retains its own hit \npoints and physical abilities and properties. \nThe DM decides if any additional modifica- \ntions are necessary; for example, perhaps \nclumsiness or inefficiency occurs if the cast- \ner must become used to the new form. The \nalignment of the host or receptacle is that of \nthe occupying life force. \nThe caster can shift freely from the host to \nthe receptacle if within the 10-feeVlevel \nrange. Each attempt to shift requires one \nround. The spell ends when the wizard \nshifts from the jar to his own body. \nA successful dispel magic spell cast on the \nhost can drive the caster of the magic jar \nspell back into the receptacle and prevent \nhim from making any attacks for ld4 \nrounds plus 1 round per level of the caster of \nthe dispel. The base success chance is 50%. \n+ / - 5 % per level difference between the \ncasters. A successful dispel magic cast \nagainst the receptacle forces the occupant \nback into his own body. If the wizard who \ncast the magic jar is forced back into his own \nbody, the spell ends. \nIf the host body is slain, the caster returns \nto the receptacle, if within range, and the \nlife force of the host departs (i.e., it is dead). \nIf the host body is slain beyond the range of \nthe spell, both the host and the caster die, \nAny life force with nowhere to go is treat- \ned as slain unless recalled by a raise dead, \nresurrection, or similar spell. \nIf the body of the caster is slain, his life \nforce survives if it is in either the receptacle \nor the host. If the receptacle is destroyed \nwhile the caster’s life force occupies it, the \ncaster is irrevocably slain. \nMajor Creation (Illusion/Phantasm) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nLike the minor creation spell, major crea- \ntion enables the wizard to pull wisps of \nmaterial from the plane of Shadow to create \nan item of nonliving, vegetable nature-soft \ngoods, rope, wood, etc. The wizard can also \ncreate mineral objects-stone, crystal, \nmetal, etc. The item created cannot exceed \none cubic foot per level of the spellcaster in \nvolume. The duration of the created item \nvaries with its relative hardness and rarity: \nVegetable matter 2 hours/level \nStone or crystal 1 hour/level \nPrecious metals 2 turns/level \nGems 1 turn/level \nMithral 2 rounddlevel \nAdamantite 1 round/level \n* Includes similar rare metals. \nAttempting to use any of these as material \ncomponents in a spell will cause the spell to \nfail. The spellcaster must have at least a tiny \npiece of matter of the same type as the item \nhe plans to create-a bit of twisted hemp to \ncreate rope, a chip of stone to create a boul- \nder, and so on. \nMonster Surnrnoi \n(ConjurationBummoning) \nRange: 50 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 4 rounds + 1 round/ievei \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \n’ \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning I spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld4 3rd-level monsters. These \nappear within spell range and attack the \ncaster’s opponents, until either he com- \nmands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale and vanish \nwhen slain. If no opponent exists to fight, \nand the wizard can communicate with \nthem, the summoned monsters can perform \nother services for the wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small candle. \nMordenkainen’s Faithful Hound \n(ConjurationlSummoning) \nRange: 10 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: Special \nCasting Time: 5 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nBy means of this spell, the wizard sum- \nmons up a phantom watchdog that only he \ncan see. He may then command it to per- \nform as guardian of a passage, room, door, \nor similar space or portal. The phantom \nwatchdog immediately commences a loud \nbarking if any creature larger than a cat \napproaches the place it guards. As the faith- \nful hound is able to detect invisible creatures \nand ward against the approach of ethereal \ncreatures, it is an excellent guardian. It does \nnot react to illusions that are not at least \nquasi-real. \nIf the intruding creature exposes its back \nto the watchdog, the dog delivers a vicious \nattack as if it were a 10-Hit Dice monster, \nstriking for 3d6 points of damage. It is &le \nto hit opponents of all types, even those \nnormally subject only to magical weapons \nof +3 or greater. Creatures without backs \nare not attacked (ochre jellies, for instance). \nThe faithful hound cannot be attacked, but \nit can be dispelled. The spell lasts for a maxi- \nmum of one hour plus 1/2 hour per caster \nlevel, but once it is activated by an intruder, \nit lasts only one round per caster level. If the \nspellcaster is ever more than 30 yards dis- \ntant from the area that the watchdog \nguards, the spell ends. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a \nthread. \n170"
