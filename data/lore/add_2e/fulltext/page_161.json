Fur- \nthermore, these massmorphed creatures can \nbe passed through-and even touched-by \nother creatures without revealii their true \nnature. Note, however, that blows to the \ncreature-trees cause damage, and blood can \nbe seen. \nCreatures to be massmorphed must be \nwithin the spell's area of effect and unwilling \ncreatures are not affected. Affected crea- \ntures remain unmoving but aware, subject \nto normal sleep requirements, and able to \nsee, hear, and feel for as long as the spell is in \neffect. The spell persists until the caster \ncommands it to cease or until a dispel magic \nspell is cast upon the creatures. Creatures \nleft in this state for extended periods are \nsubject to insects, weather, disease, fire, and \nother natural hazards. \nThe material component of this spell is a \nhandful of bark chips from the type of tree \nthe creatures are to become. \nMinor Creation (IllwiodPhantasm) \nRange: Touch \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 hour/level \nCasting Time: 1 turn \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell enables the wizard to create an \nitem of non-living, vegetable nature-soft \ngoods, rope, wood, etc. The caster actually \npulls wisps of material of the plane of \nShadow from the air and weaves them into \nthe desired item. The volume of the item \ncreated cannot exceed one cubic foot per \nlevel of the spellcaster. The item remains in \nexistence for only as long as the spell's dura- \ntion. \nThe spellcaster must have at least a tiny \npiece of matter of the same type of item he \nplans to create by means of the minor crea- \ntion spell-a bit of twisted hemp to create \nrope, a splinter of wood to create a door, \nand so forth. \nI \nMinor Globe of Invulnerabiiity \n(Abjuration) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell creates an immobile, faintly \nshimmering magical sphere around the \ncaster that prevents any 1st-, and-, or 3rd- \nlevel spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the \narea of effect of any such spells does not in- \nclude the area of the minor globe of hvul- \nnerability). This includes innate abilities \nand effects from devices. However, any \ntype of spell can be cast out of the magical \nsphere, and these pass from the caster of the \nglobe to their subject without affecting the \nminor globe. Fourth and higher level spells \nare not affected by the globe. The globe can \nbe brought down by a successful dispel \nmagic spell. The caster can leave and return \nto the globe without penalty. Note that spell \neffects are not actually disrupted by the \nglobe unless cast directly through or into \nit: The caster would still see a mirror image \ncreatedby a wizard outside the globe. If that \nwizard then entered the globe, the images \nwould wink out, to reappear when the wiz- \nard exited the globe. Likewise, a wizard \nstanding in the area of a light spell would \nstill receive sufficient light for vision, even \nthough that part of the light spell volume in \nthe globe would not be luminous. \nThe material component of the spell is a \nglass or crystal bead that shatters at the ex- \npiration of the spell. \nMonster Summoning II \n(ConjuratiowSummoning) \nRange: 40 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: Special \nSaving Throw: None \nThis spell is much like the 3rd-level mon- \nster summoning 1 spell, except that this spell \nsummons ld6 2nd-level monsters. These ap- \npear anywhere within the spell range and at- \ntack the caster's opponents, until he \ncommands them to cease, the spell duration \nexpires, or the monsters are slain. These \ncreatures do not check morale; they vanish \nwhen slain. If no opponent exists to fight \nand the wizard can communicate with \nthem, the summoned monsters can perform \nother services for the summoning wizard. \nThe material components of this spell are \na tiny bag and a small (not necessarily lit) \ncandle. \nOtiiuke's Resilient Sphere \n(Alteration, Evocation) \nRange: 20 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1-foot diameter/levd \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the result is a globe \nof shimmering force that encloses the sub- \nject creature-if it is small enough to fit \nwithin the diameter of the sphere and it fails \nto successfdy save vs. spell. The resilient \nsphere cnntains its subject for the spell's du- \nration, and it is not subject to damage of any \nsort except from a rod of cancellation, a \nwand of negation, or a disintegrate or dispel \nmagic spell. These cause it to be destroyed \nwithout harm to the subject. Nothing can \npass through the sphere, inside or out, \nthough the subject can breathe normally. \nThe subject may struggle, but all that occurs \nis a movement of the sphere. The globe can \nbe physically moved either by people out- \nside the globe or by the struggles of those \nwithin. \nThe material components of the spell are \na hemispherical piece of diamond (or similar \nhard, clear gem material) and a matching \nhemispherical piece of gum arabic. \nPhantasmal Killer (IllusionlPhsntrsm) \nRange: 5 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Special \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard creates \nthe illusion of the most fearsome thing \nimaginable to the victim, simply by fonnirlg \nthe fears of the victim's subconscious mind \ninto something that its conscious mind can \nvisualize-the most horriblebeast. Only the \nspell recipient can see the phantasmal killer \n(the caster sees only a shadowy shape), but \nif it succeeds in scoring a hit, thesubject dies \nfrom fright. The beast attacks as a 4 Hit Dice \nmonster. It is invulnerable to all attacks, \nand it can pass through any barriers. Once \ncast, it inexorably pursues the subject, for it \nexists only in the subject's mind. \nThe only defenses against a phantasmal \nkiller are an attempt to disbelieve (which \ncan be tried but once), slaying or rendering \nunconscious the wizard who cast the spell, \nor rendering unconscious the target of the \nspell for its duration. To disbelieve the killer, \nthe subject must specifically state the at- \ntempt and then roll an Intelligence check. \nThis roll has a -1 penalty for every four \nlevels of the caster. \n160 \ni"
