    "text": "Whenever a player character meets an NPC \n(non-player character), fights a monster, or \neven discovers a mysterious fountain in the \nwoods, he is having an encounter. An \nencounter is any significant thing a charac- \nter meets, sees, or interacts with during the \ncourse of a game. When a player character \ndiscovers the fountain of blue flame in the \nmidst of the forest, its very strangeness \nforces the character to react and the player \nto think. Why is it here? Does it have a pur- \npose? Is it beneficial or dangerous? Few \ncharacters are going to pass this by as just \nanother flaming fountain in the forest. \nEncounters are vital to the AD&D@ game, \nfor without them nothing can really happen \nto the player character. An adventure with- \nout encounters is like sitting in a room all \nday with no one to talk to and little to look \nat. It certainly wouldn't be very exciting. \nAnd who wants to play an unexciting role- \nplaying game? Encounters provide danger, \nrisk, mystery, information, intrigue, sus- \npense, humor, and more. \nFor an encounter to provide excitement, it \nmust also have an element of danger. A \ngood deal of this comes from the fact that \nplayer characters don't know how the \nencountered beings will react to them. Your \nDM is not going to say, 'You meet a group of \npeasants and they are friendly.\" (If he does \nsay this, you ought to be suspicious.) \nInstead, he will say something like, \"As you \nride around the bend, you come upon an ox- \ncart lumbering down the road. A young \nman in rough clothes is leading the cart. \nPeering over the sides are a woman and sev- \neral dirty children. When the man sees you \nhe nods, smiles, and says,'Hail, strangers. \nHave you news of Thornhampton-on-the- \nHill?' \" You can probably guess they are \npeasants and they seem friendly, but your \nDM didn't come out and said so. Not know- \ning for sure is what keeps you on your toes. \nThey could be anything1 \nWhen your character travels or explores a \ndungeon, your DM will have prepared two \ngeneral types of encounters. The first are \nspecific (planned) encounters. These are \nmeetings, events, or things the DM has cho- \nsen to place in the adventure to build on the \nstory of the adventure. \nFor example, upon sneaking into the bug- \nbear stronghold, your characters find a \nsqualid cell filled with humans and elves. \nYour DM has placed them here for your \ncharacter to rescue. Of course, he could also \nbe playing a trick and the prisoners could \nactually be evil dopplegangers (creatures \nable to change their appearances at will). \nLater, while in the hallway, your group \nbumps into a bugbear patrol. This is the sec- \nond type of encounter, a random encounter, \nalso called a wandering encounter. In this \ncase, your DM has made die rolls to see if \nyou come upon something and. if so. just \nwhat that something is. \n4 \n1 \nSpecific encounters generally have more \nchoices of action-your DM may want you \nto discover some important information or \nset up a particularly difficult battle. Specific \nencounters usually yield greater treasures \nand more magical items. Creatures may be \nplaced by the DM to guard the armory or \nprevent the characters from reaching the \nthrone room. \nRandom encounters normally involve \nsimple choices-run away, fight, or ignore. \nSometimes characters can talk to creatures \nin random encounters and learn valuable \ninformation, but not often. Random \nencounters also tend to have little or no \ntreasure. A patrol of city guardsmen does \nnot carry as many valuable items on its \nrounds as it would have in its barracks. \nRandom encounters are most often used to \nweaken PCs, raise an unexpected alarm, \nhurry them along, or just make their lives \ndifficult. \nSometimes encounters are not with peo- \nple or monsters but with things. The foun- \ntain in the forest is an encounter, but your \ncharacters cannot fight it or talk to it (well, \nmaybe not). So what are you supposed to \ndo? In these cases, the encounter is more of a \npuzzle. You have to figure out why this \nfountain is here, what it can do, and if it is \nimportant to your adventure. It may be a \nred herring-something placed there just to \nconfuse you; it may be a set up for a future \nadventure-later on your characters may \nlearn that the flaming fountain they saw is \nimportant to their latest mission. It may be a \ndeadly trap. To find out, though, you will \nhave to deal with the thing in some way. You \ncould throw stones into the pool, drink the \nglowing water, try to walk through the \nflames, or use spells to learn more. By doing \nthese things, you may get more information \nfrom your DM. Of course, you may not like \nthe answer! ('You drank the water? Oh, \ndear. Tsk, tsk, tsk.\") \nThe Surprise Roll \nSometimes an en- \ncounter, either random or planned by the \nDM, catches one of the two groups involved \ntotally off guard. This is called surprise and \nis determined by rolling Id10 for each side \n(or only one side if the DM has decided that \none of the sides cannot be surprised, for \nsome reason). If the die roll is a 1, 2, or 3, \nthat group or character is surprised (for \neffects, see the \"Effects of Surprise\" section). \nNaturally, surprise does not happen all the \ntime. There are many easy and intelligent \nways it can beprevented. The most obvious \nis if the player characters can see those they \nare about to encounter well before getting \nclose. For example the characters may see \nthe dust of a group of horsemen coming \ntheir way, or notice the lanterns of a group \nof peasants coming through the woods, or \nhear the grunting barks of a gnoll war party \nclosing through the trees. In these cases \nthere is no way the characters are going to \nbe surprised by the encounter. But if a leop- \nard leaped upon one of the group while he \nwas intently watching the approaching \nriders, or if a group of goblins suddenly \nsprang from the dukness, then the charac- \nters would have to roll to see if they were \nsurprised. They were unprepared for these \nthreats and so could be taken off guard. \nThe DM decides when a check for sur- \nprise must be made. He can require that one \nroll be made for the entire party, that a sepa- \nrate check be made for each character, or \nthat only specific characters check. This \ndepends entirely upon the situation. \nFor example, the entire party is intently \nwatching the band of approaching riders. \nThen a leopard leaps from the branches of a \ntree overhead. The DM knows that no one \nin the group was particularly paying atten- \ntion to the treetops, so he has one person in \nthe group roll the surprise die for the entire \nparty. The roll is a 2, the PCs are surprised, \nthe leopard gets a free round of attacks, and \nthere is mass confusion as the clawing, bit- \ning creature lands in their midst1 If two of \nthe characters had been on a general watch, \nthe DM could have had these characters roll \nfor surprise instead of the entire group. If \nboth were surprised, the entire group wodd \nhave been unprepared for the leopard's \nattack. Otherwise, one or both of the \nguards might have noticed the creature \nbefore it pounced. Experienced player char- \nacters quickly learn the value of having \nsomeone on watch at all times. \nThe surprise roll can also be modified by \nDexterity, race, class, cleverness, and situa- \ntion. The DM has the listing of modifiers \nthat apply to given situations. Modifiers can \naffect either your character's chance of \nbeing surprised or his chance of surprising \nothers. A plus to your die roll reduces the \nodds that you are surprised; a minus \nincreases those odds. Likewise, a minus to \nthe enemy's die roll means that the modifier \nis in your favor, while a plus means that \nthings are going his way. High Dexterity \ncharacters are virtually unsurpriseable, \ncaught off guard only in unusual situations. \nIt is important to bear in mind that sur- \nprise and ambush are two different things. \nSurprise works as explained above. An \nambush is prepared by one group to make \nan unexpected attack on another group and \nworks only if the DM decides the other \ngroup cannot detect the ambush. A proper- \nly set ambush gives the attackers the oppor- \ntunity to use spells and normal attacks \nbefore the other side reacts. If the ambush \nsucceeds, the ambushing group gets its ini- \ntial attack and the other group must roll for \nsurprise in the next round, so the ambushing \ngroup may get two rounds of attacks before \nthe other group can reply."
