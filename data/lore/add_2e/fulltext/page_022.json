    "text": "Dwarves typically dwell in hilly or moun- \ntainous regions. They prefer life in the com- \nforting gloom and solidness that is found \nunderground. They have several special \nabilities that relate to their underground \nlife, and they are noted for being particular- \nly resistant to magics and poisons. \nA character of the dwarven race can be a \ncleric, a fighter, or a thief. He can also \nchoose to be a fighter/cleric or fighterkhief. \nFrom living underground, dwarves have \nfound it useful to learn the languages of sev- \neral of their neighbors, both friendly and \nhostile. The initial languages a dwarf can \nlearn are common, dwarf, gnome, goblin, \nkobold, orc, and any others your DM \nallows. The actual number of languages is \nlimited by the Intelligence of the player \ncharacter (see Table 4) or by the proficiency \nslots he allots to languages (if that optional \nsystem is used). \nBy nature, dwarves are nonmagical and \nnever use magical spells (clerical spells are \nallowed however). This gives a bonus to \ndwarves‘ saving throws against attacks \nfrom magical wands, staves, rods, and \nspells. This bonus is +1 for every 3% \npoints of Constitutiqn score. Thus, for \nexample, if a dwarf has a Constitution score \nof 7 he gains +2 on saving throws. These \nbonuses are summarized on Table 9. \nTable 9: CONSTITUTION SAVING \nTHROW BONUSES \nConstitution Score Saving Throw Bonus \n4-6 +1 \n7-10 +2 \n11-13 +3 \n1417 +4 \n18-19 +5 \nSimilarly, dwarves have exceptional \nresistance to toxic substances. All dwarven \ncharacters make saving throws against poi- \nson with the same bonuses that they get \nagainst magical attacks (see Table 9). \nAlso because of their nonmagical nature, \nhowever, dwarves have trouble using magi- \ncal items. AU magical items that are not spe- \ncifically suited to the character’s class have a \n20 percent chance to malfunction when used \nby a dwarf. This check is made each time a \ndwarf uses a magical item. A malfunction \naffects only the current use; the item may \nwork properly next time. For devices that \nare continually in operation, the check is \nmade the first time the device is used during \nan encounter. If the check is passed, the \ndevice functions normally until it is turned \noff. Thus a dwarf would have to check upon \ndonning a robe of blending but would not \ncheck again until he had taken the robe off \nand then put it on again. If a cursed item \nmalfunctions, the character recognizes its \ncursed nature and can dispose of the item. \nMalfunction applies to rods, staves, wands, \nrings, amulets, potions, horns, jewels, and \nall other magical items except weapons, \nshields, armor, gauntlets, and girdles. This \npenalty does not apply to dwarven clerics \nusing clerical items. \nIn melee, dwarves add 1 to their dice rolls \nto hit ora, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgob- \nlins. When ogres, trolls, ogre magi, giants, \nor titans attack dwarves, these monsters \nmust subtract 4 from their attack rolls \nbecause of the dwarves’ small size and com- \nbat ability against these much bigger crea- \ntures. \nDwarven infravision enables them to see \nup to 60 feet in the dark. \nDwarves are miners of great skill. While \nunderground, they can detect the following \ninformation when within 10 feet of the par- \nticular phenomenon (but they can deter- \nmine their approximate depth below the \nsurface at any time). \nDetect grade or slope \nDetect new tunnel/passage \nDetect sliding/shifting walls \nDetect stonework traps, pits, \nDetermine approx. depth \nin passage 1-5 on ld6 \nconstruction 1-5 on ld6 \nor rooms 1-4 on ld6 \nand deadfalls 1-3 on ld6 \nunderground 1-3 on ld6 \nNote that the dwarf must deliberately try \nto make these determinations; the informa- \ntion does not simply spring to mind unbid- \nden. \nBecause of their sturdy builds, dwarves \nadd 1 to their initial Constitution scores. \nTheir dour and suspicious natures cause \nthem to subtract 1 from their initial Cha- \nrisma scores. \nElves \nElves tend to be \nsomewhat shorter and slimmer than normal \nhumans. Their features are finely chiseled \nand delicate, and they speak in melodic \ntones. Although they appear fragile and \nweak, as a race they are quick and strong. \nElves often live to be over 1,200 years old, \nalthough long before this time they feel \ncompelled to depart the realms of men and \nmortals. Where they go is uncertain, but it is \nan undeniable urge of their race. \nElves are often considered frivolous and \naloof. In fact, they are not, although \nhumans often find their personalities impos- \nsible to fathom. They concern themselves \nwith natural beauty, dancing and frolicking, \nplaying and singing, unless necessity dic- \ntates otherwise. They are not fond of ships \nor mines, but enjoy growing things and gaz- \ning at the open sky. Even though elves tend \ntoward haughtiness and arrogance at times, \nthey regard their friends and, associates as \nequals. They do not make friends easily, but \na friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They \nprefer to distance themselves from humans, \nhave little love for dwarves, and hate the \nevil denizens of the woods. \nTheir humor is clever, as are their songs \nand poetry. Elves are brave but never fool- \nhardy. They eat sparingly; they drink mead \nand wine, but seldom to excess. While they \nfind well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to \nbehold, they are not overly interested in \nmoney or gain. They find magic and sword- \nplay (or any refined combat art) fascinating. \nIf they have a weakness it lies in these inter- \nests. \nThere are five branches of the elven \nrace: aquatic, gray, high, wood, and dark. \nElf player characters are always assumed to \nbe of the most common type-high elves- \nalthough a character can be another type of \nelf with the DMs permission (but the choice \ngrants no additional powers). To the eye of \noutsiders, the differences between the \ngroups are mostly cosmetic, but most elves \nmaintain that there are important cultural \ndifferences between the various groups. \nAquatic elves spend their lives beneath the \nwaves and have adapted to these condi- \ntions. Gray elves are considered the most \nnoble and serious-minded of this breed. \nHigh elves are the most common. Wood \nelves are considered to be wild, tempera- \nmental, and savage. All others hold that the \nsubterranean dark elves are compt and \nevil, no longer part of the elven community. \nA player character elf can be a cleric, \nfighter, mage, thief, or ranger. In addition, \nan elf can choose to be a multi-class fighter/ \nmage, fighterlthief, fighter/mage/thief, or \nmagehhief. (The rules governing these \ncombinations am explained under Multi- \nClass Characters, page 44.) \nElves have found it useful to learn the lan- \nguages of several of the forest‘s children, \nboth the good and the bad. As initial lan- \nguages, an elf can choose common, elf, \ngnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, \nand gnoll. The number of languages an elf \ncan learn is limited by his Intelligence (see \nTable 4) or the proficiency slots he allots to \nlanguages (if that optional system is used). \nElven characters have 90 percent mist- \nance to sleep and all charm-related wlls. \n(See Chapter 9: Combat for an explanation \nof magic resistance.) This is in addition to \nthe normal saving throw allowed against a \ncharm spell. \nWhen employing a bow of any sort other \nthan a crossbow, or when using a short or \nlong sword, elves gain a bonus of +1 to \ntheir attack rolls. \nAn elf can gain a bonus to surprise oppo- \nnents, but only if the elf is not in metal \narmor. Even then, the elf must either be \nalone, or with a party comprised only of \nelves or halflings (also not in metal armor), \nor 90 feet or more away from his party (the \ngroup of characters he-rh with) to gain this \nr \n21"
