    "text": "The spell lasts for two rounds plus one \nround for each level of the caster. Those \nwho fail are checked by the DM for actions \neach round for the duration of the spell, or \nuntil the ”wander away for the duration of \nthe spell“ result occurs. \nWandering creatures move as far from the \ncaster as possible, according to their most \ntypical mode of movement (characters \nwalk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Saving \nthrows and actions are checked at the begin- \nning of each round. Any confused creature \nthat is attacked perceives the attacker as an \nenemy and acts according to its basic \nnature. \nIf there are many creatures involved, the \nDM may decide to assume average results. \nFor example, if there are 16 orcs affected \nand 25% could be expected tb make the sav- \ning throw, then four are ashmed to have \nsucceeded. Out of the other 12, one wanders \naway, four attack the nearest creature, six \nstand confused, and the last acts normally \nbut must check next round. Since the ora \nare not near the party, the DM decides that \ntwo attacking the nearest creature attack \neach other, one attacks an orc that saved, \nand one attacks a confused orc, which \nstrikes back. The next round, the base is 11 \nora, since four originally saved and one \nwandered off. Another one wanders off, \nfive stand confused, four attack, and one \nacts normally. \nThe material component is a set of three \nnut shells. \nContaglon (Necromancy) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S \nDuration: Permanent \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 1 creature \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nThis spell causes a major disease and \nweakness in a creature. The afflicted indi- \nvidual is immediately stricken with painful \nand distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, \nlesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. \nStrength, Dexterity, and Charisma are \nreduced by 2. Attack rolls are decreased by \n2. The effect persists until the character \nreceives a cure diseuse spell or spends Id3 \nweeks taking a complete rest to recover. \nCharacters ignoring the contagion for more \nthan a day or so may be susceptible to worse \ndiseases at the discretion of the DM. \nWizard Spells (4th Level) \nDetect Scrying (Divination) \nRange: 0 \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: ld6 turns + 1 turn/level \nCasting Time: 3 \nArea of Effect: 120-foot radius \nSaving Throw: Special \nBy means of this spell, the wizard imme- \ndiately becomes aware of any attempt to \nobserve him by means of clairvoyance, \nclairaudience, or magic mirror. This also \nreveals the use of crystal balls or other magi- \ncal scrying devices, provided the attempt is \nwithin the area of effect of the spell. Since \nthe spell is centered on the spellcaster, it \nmoves with him, enabling him to “sweep” \nareas for the duration of the spell. \nWhen a scrying attempt is detected, the \nscryer must immediately roll a saving \nthrow. If this is faild, the identity and gen- \neral location of the scryer immediately \nbecome known to the wizard who cast this \nspell. The general location is a direction and \nsignificant landmark close to the scryer. \nThus, the caster might learn, ’The wizard \nSniggel spies on us from east, under the \nstairs,” or, ‘You are watched by Asquil in the \ncity of Samarquol.” \nThe material components for this spell are \na small piece of mirror and a miniature brass \nhearing trumpet. \nDig (Evocation) \nRange: 30 yards \nComponents: V, S, M \nDuration: 1 round/level \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 5-foot cube/level \nSaving Throw: Special \nA dig spell enables the caster to excavate \n125 cubic feet of earth, sand, or mud per \nround (i.e., a cubic hole five feet on a side). \nIn later rounds the caster can expand an \nexisting hole or start a new one. The materi- \nal thrown from the excavation scatters \nevenly around the pit. If the wizard con- \ntinues downward past 20 feet in earth, there \nis a 15% chance that the pit collapses. This \ncheck is made for every five feet dug beyond \n20 feet. Sand tends to collapse after 10 feet, \nmud fills in and collapses after five feet, and \nquicksand fills in as rapidly as it is dug. \nAny creature at the edge (within one foot) \nof a pit must roll a successful Dexterity \ncheck or fall into the hole. Creatures mov- \ning rapidly toward a pit dug immediately \nbefore them must roll a saving throw vs. \nspell to avoid falling in. Any creature in a \npit being excavated can climb out at a rate \ndecided by the DM. A creature caught in a \ncollapsing pit must roll a saving throw vs. \ndeath to avoid being buried; it escapes the \npit if successful. Tunneling is possible with \nthis spell as long as there is space available \n155 \nm \nfor the material removed. Chances for \nlapse are doubled and safe tunneling \ntance is half of the safe excavation d \nunless such construction is most carefully \nbraced and \nof earth and rock, particularly clay golems \nand those from the elemental plane of Earth. \nWhen cast upon such a creature, it suffers \n4d6 points of damage. A successful saving \nthrow vs. spell reduces this damage to half. \nTo activate the spell, the spellcaster needs \na miniature shovel and tiny bucket and \nmust contii \nexcavated. \nconclusion of the spell. \nDimension Door (AI \nRange: 0 \nComponen \nDuration: Instantaneous \nCasting Time: 1 \nArea of Effect: The caster \nSaving Throw: None \nwizard instantly transfers himself up to 30 \nyards distance per level of experience. This \nspecial form of teleportation allows for no \nerror, and the wizard always arrives at \nexactly the spot desired-whether by sim- \nply visualizing the area (within spell tranda \ndistance, of course) or by stating direction \nsuch as, ”300 yards straight downward: or, \n“upward to the northwest, 45 degree angle, \n420 yards.” If the wizard arrives in a place \nthat is already occupied by a solid body, he \nremains trapped in the Astral plane. If dis- \ntances are stated and the spellcaster arrives \nwith no sui \nair), falling \nmagical means are employed. All that the \nwizard wears or carries, subject to a maxi- \nmum weight equal to 500 pounds of nonliv- - \ning matter, or half that amount of living \nmatter, is transferred with the spellcaster. \nRecovery from use of a dimension door \nspell requires one round. ~ \nEmotion (Ench.ntment/Charm) \nThe spell .. \nBy means of a dimension \nRange: 10 yards/level \nComponents: V, S \nDuration Special \nCasting Time: 4 \nArea of Effect: 2O-fwt cube \nSaving Throw: Neg. \nWhen this spell is cast, the wizard can cre- \nate a single emotional reaction in the subject \ncreatures. The following are typical: \n1. Courage: This emotion causes the \ncreatures affected to become berserk, fight- \ning with a + 1 bonus to the attack dice, caw \ning +3 points of damage, and temporarily \ngaining 5 hit points. The recipients fight \nwithout shield, and regardless of life, never I"
