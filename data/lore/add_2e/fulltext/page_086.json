Clearly \nthen, it behooves the priest to maintain him- \nself in good standing with this power, \nthrough word and deed. Priests who slip in \ntheir duties, harbor indiscreet thoughts, or \nneglect their beliefs, find that their deity has \nan immediate method of redress. If the \npriest has failed in his duties, the deity can \ndeny him spells as a clear message of dissat- \nisfaction. For minor infractions, the deity \ncan deny minor spells. Major failings result \nin the denial of major spells or, even worse, \nall spells. These can be regained if the char- \nacter immediately begins to make amends \nfor his errors. Perhaps the character only \nneeds to be a little more vigilant, in the case \nof a minor fault. A serious transgression \ncould require special service, such as a quest \nor some great sacrifice of goods. These are \nthings your DM will decide, should your \ncharacter veer from the straight and narrow \npath of his religion. \nFinally, your DM may rule that not all \ndeities are equal, so that those of lesser \npower are unable to grant certain spells. If \nthis optional rule is used, powers of demi- \ngod status can only grant spells up to the 5th \nspell level. Lesser deities can grant6th-level \nspells, while the greater deities have all spell \nlevels available to them. You should inquire \nabout this at the time you create your char- \nacter (and decide which deity he worships), \nto prevent any unwelcome surprises later \non. \nCasting Spells \nBoth wizards and \npriests use the same rules for casting spells. \nTo cast a spell, the character must first have \nthe spell memorized. If it is not memorized, \nthe spell cannot be cast. The caster must be \nable to speak (not under the effects of a \nsilence spell or gagged) and have both arms \nfree. (Note that the optional spell compo- \nnent rule [following section] can modify \nthese conditions.) If the spell is targeted on a \nperson, place, or thing, the caster must be \nable to see the target. It isnot enough to cast \na fireball 150 feet ahead into the darkness; \nthe caster must be able to see the point of \nexplosion and the intervening distance. \nLikewise, a magic missile (which always hits \nits target) cannot be fired into a group of \nbandits with the instruction to strike the \nleader; the caster must be able to identify \nand see the leader. \nOnce the casting has begun, the character \nmust stand still. Casting cannot be accom- \nplished while riding a roughly moving beast \nor a vehicle, unless special efforts are made \nto stabilize and protect the caster. Thus a \nspell cannot be cast from the back of a gal- \nloping horse under any conditions, nor can \na wizard or priest cast a spell on the deck of \nr \na ship during a storm. However, if the caster \nwere below decks, protected from the wind \nand surging waves, he could cast a spell. \nWhile it is not normally possible to cast a \nspell from a moving chariot, a character \nwho was steadied and supported by others \ncould do so. Your DM will have to make a \nruling in these types of extraordinary condi- \ntions. \nDuring the round in which the spell is \ncast, the caster cannot move to dodge \nattacks. Therefore, no AC benefit from \nDexterity is gained by spellcasters while \ncasting spells. Furthermore, if the spelkast- \ner is struck by a weapon or fails to make a \nsaving throw before the spell is cast, the \ncaster's concentration is disrupted. The spell \nis lost in a fizzle of useless energy and is \nwiped clean from the memory of the caster \nuntil it can be rememorized. Spellcasters are \nwell advised not to stand at the front of any \nbattle, at least if they want to be able to cast \nany spells! \n85 \nI \nI \nacter casts a spell, it is assumed that he \ndoing something to activate that sp \nHe may utter a few words, wave \nhand around a couple of times, wigg \nhis toes, swallow a live spider, etc. Bu \nunder the standard rules, you don't have \nto know exactly what he does to activate \nthe spell. Some of this can be answeredif"
